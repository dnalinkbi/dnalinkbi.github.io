# Gene: ACCS

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11q13.2

**Function for gene:** The ACCS gene encodes for a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, which is an enzyme responsible for activating fatty acids by attaching them to coenzyme A, facilitating their transport into the mitochondria for oxidative metabolism.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000172583
- OMIM: 612126
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N139

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- No known pathogenic variants have been reported in the ACCS gene according to ClinVar.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- No known somatic mutations have been reported in the ACCS gene.

**Related Disease:**
- No known disease has been associated with ACCS mutations. 

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
