# Gene Information Analysis: NDUFV2

## Gene Information

- **Gene Symbol:** NDUFV2
- **Gene Name:** NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2
- **Chromosome:** 18
- **Genomic Location:** 18p11.22
- **Aliases:** 24kD, CI-24, FLJ22298, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24 kDa subunit, NDUFV2M

## Function

The NDUFV2 gene encodes a subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is a part of the electron transport chain. The complex is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is a critical step in the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. NDUFV2 plays a vital role in the energy production process.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the NDUFV2 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms involving multiple organ systems. The clinical features of this disorder vary widely, with some individuals experiencing isolated neurologic or muscle abnormalities, while others have more widespread symptoms affecting multiple organ systems.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no definitive treatment available for mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The prognosis of this disorder varies significantly, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the organs affected, and the age of onset.

## Drug Response

There are no known drugs available targeting the NDUFV2 gene directly.
