# Gene HRG

## Genomic Position
The HRG gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q27.3.

## Pathology
The HRG gene is associated with thrombosis and coagulation disorders. Research shows that HRG gene variants play a significant role in the risk of developing venous thrombosis.

## Function
The HRG gene encodes Histidine-rich glycoprotein, a plasma protein that regulates the activity of various enzymes involved in coagulation, complement activation, and fibrinolysis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
In the context of somatic SNVs/InDels, there is no information found in the dbSNP database related to HRG gene.

## Related disease
Variants in HRG gene is found to be associated with the following diseases:
- Venous thromboembolism
- Essential thrombocythemia
- Diminished anticoagulant levels in the blood

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis depend on the type of clotting disorder caused by HRG gene variation.

## Drug response
There is no specific drug or therapy available for the treatment of HRG gene variants.
