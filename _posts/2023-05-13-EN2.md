# Gene EN2

## Information
- **Gene Name:** EN2 (Engrailed Homeobox 2)
- **Location:** Chromosome 7 (7q36.3)
- **Aliases:** En2

## Function
EN2 is a homeobox transcription factor gene that plays a crucial role in early embryonic development and the patterning of midbrain and cerebellum. It is expressed in specific regions of the brain during development and adulthood, where it regulates neuronal differentiation and connectivity.
