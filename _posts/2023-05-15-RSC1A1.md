## Gene Information: RSC1A1

### Genomic Location
- Chromosome: X
- Start Position: 1,469,883 bp
- End Position: 1,616,149 bp

### Function
- RSC1A1 is a gene that encodes for the Regulator of Spindle Pole 1 protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during mitosis.
