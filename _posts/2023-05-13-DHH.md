# Gene DHH

## Genetic Position
The DHH gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p13.33). It spans about 36 kb and contains 4 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in DHH have been associated with several disorders including 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY CGD) and partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) with or without minifascicular neuropathy.

## Function
DHH encodes a protein called desert hedgehog, which is a secreted signaling molecule that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and tissue polarity during embryonic development. Desert hedgehog signaling is involved in the development of several organs and tissues, including the gonads, limbs, hair follicles, and teeth.

- Partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) with or without minifascicular neuropathy

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options for DHH-related disorders vary depending on the specific condition and its severity. In some cases, hormone replacement therapy or surgery may be recommended. The long-term prognosis also depends on the specific condition and its management.

## Drug response
There is no specific drug treatment for DHH-related disorders at this time.
