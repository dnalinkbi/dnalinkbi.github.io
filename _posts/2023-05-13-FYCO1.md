# Gene FYCO1

- Function: FYCO1 encodes for a protein that is involved in the transportation of cellular cargo, including mitochondria and autophagosomes, along microtubules. It is also involved in autophagy regulation.

- Related Disease:
    - FYCO1 mutations have been associated with autosomal-recessive spinocerebellar ataxia (OMIM: 613728).

- Treatment and Prognosis:
    - There is currently no known cure for autosomal-recessive spinocerebellar ataxia. Management of symptoms is typically the course of treatment. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

- Drug Response:
    - There is currently no known drug specifically targeting FYCO1 mutations or spinocerebellar ataxia.
