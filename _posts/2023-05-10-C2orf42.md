# Information about Gene C2orf42

## Genetic Position
Gene C2orf42 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q31.1.

## Pathology and Function
The function of gene C2orf42 is still not fully understood. However, research suggests that it may play a role in ocular development and craniofacial patterning. Mutations in the C2orf42 gene have been linked to various ocular disorders, including Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and Peters anomaly.
