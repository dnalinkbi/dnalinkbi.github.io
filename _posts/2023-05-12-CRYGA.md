# Gene information for CRYGA
## Genetic Position
The gene CRYGA is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 33.2. It spans approximately 9,680 base pairs of DNA and is oriented on the minus strand.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CRYGA gene is associated with congenital cataracts, a condition that causes opacity in the lens of the eye. Infants with mutations in this gene have a higher risk of developing bilateral cataracts.

## Function
The CRYGA gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma-crystallin A. This protein is a structural component of the lens in the eye, where it helps maintain the shape and clarity of the lens.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:2438
- NCBI Entrez ID: 1426
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000160220
- OMIM ID: 123680
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P11826
- Aliases: CRYA3, CTRCT15

## AA Mutation and dbSNP ID
The following are some of the known missense mutations found in the CRYGA gene along with their dbSNP IDs:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| p.Arg15Trp | Missense | rs61751279 |
| p.Gly23Arg | Missense | rs104894144 |
| p.Asp26His | Missense | rs104894145 |
| p.Val28Ala | Missense | rs121908004 |
| p.Leu40Pro | Missense | rs104894147 |
| p.Ala41Gly | Missense | rs267606860 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the CRYGA gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CRYGA gene are associated with congenital cataracts, a condition that causes cloudiness in the eye's lens at birth.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of congenital cataracts often requires surgical removal of the affected lens followed by the implantation of an artificial one. Early surgical intervention often results in improved visual outcome.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to the CRYGA gene.
