## Gene ATP2A3
ATP2A3 is a gene that encodes for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 3 protein. This protein is involved in the uptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum which is critical for muscle relaxation.

### Function of the Gene
The ATP2A3 gene is responsible for encoding the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 3 protein. The protein is involved in the transport of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, which is necessary for muscle relaxation post-contraction.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the ATP2A3 gene have been linked to Brody Myopathy, which is a rare disorder that affects skeletal muscles.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Brody Myopathy currently. Treatment is focused on symptom management and physical therapy to help increase mobility.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that is specifically targeted to treat Brody Myopathy.
