## Gene SYN2

### Genetic Position
SYN2 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3p25.2.

### Pathology
The mutations in SYN2 have been associated with several diseases including X-linked intellectual disability 96 (MIM: 300387), autism spectrum disorder (MIM: 209850), and schizophrenia (MIM: 181500).

### Function
The SYN2 gene encodes synapsin II, a member of the synapsin family of neuronal phosphoproteins. This protein plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity.

### Related Disease
The mutations in SYN2 have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability 96 (MIM: 300387), autism spectrum disorder (MIM: 209850), and schizophrenia (MIM: 181500).

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for genetic disorders linked with SYN2 mutations. The treatment is symptom-based and supportive. Individuals with intellectual disability require educational support, while those with schizophrenia may benefit from pharmacological intervention and psychotherapy.

### Drug Response
There is no specific medication for SYN2 mutations. However, individuals with schizophrenia may benefit from antipsychotic medication.
