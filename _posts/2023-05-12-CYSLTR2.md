## Gene Information:

**Gene:** CYSLTR2

**Aliases:** CYSLT2, GPR44

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 13q14

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 2563
- NCBI Entrez: 57105
- Ensembl: ENSG00000102938
- OMIM: 604960
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y271


## Gene Function:

The CYSLTR2 gene encodes for a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor that plays a role in the inflammatory response. It is involved in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, especially in the lungs, and has been associated with asthma and other respiratory diseases. 


## Mutations:

**AA Mutation List:**

There are no known or reported mutations for this gene in humans.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

There are no reports of somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene.


## Related Diseases:

CYSLTR2 has been associated with the following diseases:

- Asthma

- Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection

- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)


## Treatment and Prognosis:

There are currently no treatments or known prognoses specific to mutations in the CYSLTR2 gene.

## Drug Response:

CYSLTR2 is a target for several drugs used in the treatment of asthma, including montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast.
