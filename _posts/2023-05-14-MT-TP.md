# Gene MT-TP Information

**Genetic Position:** MT-TP is located on the mitochondrial DNA at position 16,024-16,569.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the MT-TP gene can lead to mitochondrial diseases and disorders, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).

**Function:** The MT-TP gene encodes for the mitochondrial tRNA for phenylalanine (UUC).

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the MT-TP gene.

**Related Disease:** LHON is a mitochondrial disorder that is primarily caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes, including MT-TP. LHON affects the optic nerve and can lead to vision loss or blindness.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for LHON, but there are treatments that can help slow the progression of the disease, such as idebenone and gene therapy.

**Drug Response:** Idebenone has been shown to improve visual acuity in some individuals with LHON. Gene therapy is also being explored as a potential treatment for LHON.
