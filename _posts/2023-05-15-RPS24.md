## Gene: RPS24

### General Information
- **Function for gene:** RPS24 encodes for ribosomal protein S24 which is a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome. It is essential for the assembly of the ribosome and protein synthesis process.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
  - Gene ID: 6236
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 10 (NC_000010.11)
  - Aliases: RPS24A, S24H, S24e
- **External sites:**
  - HGNC: 10469
  - NCBI Entrez: 6236
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000068831
  - OMIM: 603701
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P62847

### Mutations and Variations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
  - c.103C>T (p.Thr35Met), rs201103910
  - c.109C>T (p.Pro37Leu), rs3745409
  - c.146G>A (p.Asp49Asn), rs55810157
  - c.302C>T (p.Pro101Ser), rs28673702
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - c.1A>T, rs794726276
  - c.172C>T, rs776347311
  - c.198G>A, rs771536110
- **Related disease:** Mutations in RPS24 have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a rare inherited disorder that affects erythroid progenitor cells and leads to bone marrow failure.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for Diamond-Blackfan anemia usually includes steroids and red blood cell transfusions. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and individual response to treatment.
- **Drug response:** There is currently no targeted drug therapy for Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Steroids and transfusions are the mainstay treatment options.
