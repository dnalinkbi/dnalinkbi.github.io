# Gene Information for HAND1

## Genetic Position and Pathology:

- **Gene Name:** HAND1 (Heart and Neural Crest Derivatives Expressed 1)
- **Location:** Chromosome 5:139,972,918-140,026,464
- **Pathology:** Mutations in HAND1 have been associated with congenital heart defects and dilated cardiomyopathy.

## Function:

HAND1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in heart development by regulating myocardial differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis.

## External IDs and Aliases:

- **HGNC ID:** 4708
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 9421
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000113578
- **OMIM ID:** 602406
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** O96004
- **Aliases:** Heart- and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 1, Thing1, bHLHa27

## Variations:

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
    - p.Lys27Glu (rs374697228)
    - p.Thr28Ala (rs387906536)
    - p.Ala43Pro (rs368865601)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

## Related Disease:

- Congenital heart defects
- Dilated cardiomyopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis:

Treatment for congenital heart defects and dilated cardiomyopathy varies based on the patient's individual condition and severity of symptoms. Prognosis depends on multiple factors, including the type of defect, timing of diagnosis, and treatment options available.

## Drug Response:

There are currently no drugs specifically designed to target HAND1. However, some medications, such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors, may be used to treat symptoms associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.
