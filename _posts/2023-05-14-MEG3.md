## Gene MEG3

- **Function**: MEG3 is a long, non-coding RNA gene that has been proposed as a tumor suppressor due to its ability to induce apoptosis, arrest cell growth, and inhibit angiogenesis.

  - Ensembl: ENSG00000254670
  - OMIM: 605733
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: NA
  
  Genomic location: 14q32.2
  
- **Aliases**: N/A

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: N/A.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: N/A.

- **Related Disease**: MEG3 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and diabetic nephropathy.

- **Treatment and Prognosis**: There is no specific treatment for MEG3-related diseases. The prognosis depends on the specific disease state.

- **Drug Response**: N/A.
