# Information about Gene EPHA3

## Genetic Position
The gene EPHA3 is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3p21.3. 

## Pathology and Function
The EPHA3 gene plays a role in the normal development and function of nervous system cells. Abnormalities in this gene lead to various pathological conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. This gene regulates several cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.
