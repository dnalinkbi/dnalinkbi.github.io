# Information about Gene UGT1A5

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

The gene UGT1A5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q37), and encodes for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A5, which is an enzyme that plays an important role in drug metabolism. UGT1A5 adds glucuronic acid to substances that need to be eliminated from the body, making them more water-soluble and easier to excrete.

## Function for Gene

The UGT1A5 gene is primarily involved in the metabolism and elimination of xenobiotics (substances foreign to the body), including drugs, dietary components, and environmental toxins.

## Related Disease

Genetic variations in UGT1A5 have been associated with several diseases, including irinotecan toxicity, Gilbert syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for genetic variations in the UGT1A5 gene, as these are inherited and cannot be changed. However, knowledge of a patient's genetic profile can inform treatment decisions and drug dosing to reduce the risk of adverse reactions or improve drug efficacy.

## Drug Response

Genetic variations in the UGT1A5 gene can affect drug metabolism and response, particularly with drugs metabolized through the glucuronidation pathway. For example, individuals with reduced UGT1A5 activity may be at increased risk of toxicity from drugs such as irinotecan.
