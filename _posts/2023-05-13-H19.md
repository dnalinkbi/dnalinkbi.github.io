# Gene H19

## Genomic Location and External IDs

The H19 gene is located on chromosome 11p15.5 and its genomic coordinates are: NC_000011.10 (1753445..1761261). It is also known by the following external IDs: 

- HGNC: 4851
- NCBI Entrez: 283120
- Ensembl: ENSG00000226871
- OMIM: 103280
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P28306

Some of its aliases include ASM3, BWS, LINC00008, NCRNA00008, and TNDM.

## Function

H19 is a non-coding RNA gene that plays a critical role in gene imprinting, embryonic growth, and tumorigenesis. It is expressed only from the maternal allele and is regulated by a nearby imprinted gene, IGF2. H19 has been shown to have both tumor suppressive and oncogenic properties depending on the context and cell type.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

As H19 is a non-coding RNA gene, AA mutations are not applicable. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in H19 have been reported in various cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer. The following are some of the somatic SNVs and InDels with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- rs369199728 (c.-750A>G)
- rs111989366 (c.-110G>T)
- rs376907038 (c.-99A>C)
- rs1393254265 (c.-121_-112delTCAGGGCGGC)

## Related Disease

Aberrant expression of H19 has been associated with several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis

As H19 is involved in various diseases, including cancer, further research is needed to determine its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker.

## Drug Response

No specific drug response has been reported for H19.
