## Gene: STRADA

### Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17 (17q12)
- **Pathology:** No autosomal recessive disorders have been associated with STRADA mutations.
- **Function:** STRADA encodes for a protein that is involved in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which is related to cell growth and proliferation.
- **Aliases:**
    - LYK5
    - Protein kinase LYK5
    - Stimulation of TLR4-induced TNF-alpha production by TRIF and LYK5
    
### External IDs

- **NCBI Entrez:** 92335
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000134694
- **OMIM:** 609342
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q7RTN6
