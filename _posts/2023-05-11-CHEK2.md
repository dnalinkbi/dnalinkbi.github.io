## Gene Information

Gene: CHEK2

External IDs: 

- HGNC: 1639
- NCBI Entrez: 11200
- Ensembl: ENSG00000183765
- OMIM: 604373
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O96017

Aliases: CHK2, CDS1, RAD53

Genomic location: Chromosome 22q12.1

## Function

The CHEK2 gene is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair. It plays a crucial role in the maintenance of genome integrity by regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.

## AA Mutation List

|-----------|---------------|----------|
| p.I157T | Missense | rs17879961 |
| p.S428F | Missense | rs17878362 |
| p.H371Y | Missense | rs3730485 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

No known somatic SNVs/InDels are reported for the CHEK2 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CHEK2 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for CHEK2-related cancers vary depending on the type and stage of the cancer. Prognosis may also depend on these factors.
