## Information about gene FASTKD2

### Genetic Position
FASTKD2, also known as FAS-activated serine/threonine protein kinase domain-containing protein 2, is located on chromosome 2 at position 2q14.2-q14.3.

### Pathology
Studies have suggested that FASTKD2 plays a role in programmed cell death and is involved in the mitochondrial network homeostasis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with mitochondrial diseases, particularly early-onset Leigh syndrome (LS), a rare neurometabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. 

### Function
The FASTKD2 gene encodes a protein involved in RNA processing and splicing. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial membrane architecture, biogenesis, and function. 

### External IDs
- HGNC: 22494
- NCBI Entrez: 10227
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115852
- OMIM: 608915
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5L2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several variants in the FASTKD2 gene have been identified to date. Some of the amino acid changes that have been found are:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Leu136Phe | Missense | rs760333088 |
| p.Ser91Leu | Missense | rs764853186 |
| p.Tyr223Ser | Missense | rs759451386 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
It has been reported that some somatic variants in the FASTKD2 gene can contribute to the progression of certain types of cancers. However, these variants have not been extensively studied yet.

### Related Disease
Mutations in FASTKD2 have been linked with mitochondrial diseases, particularly early-onset Leigh Syndrome (LS), a rare progressive neurometabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for mitochondrial diseases, and treatment usually focuses on managing symptoms and slowing down the progression of the condition. In general, the prognosis for individuals with Leigh Syndrome is poor, with most affected individuals dying in childhood or early adulthood.

### Drug response
Currently, there are no specific drugs or treatments available for FASTKD2-related diseases. However, research is ongoing to identify potential therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.
