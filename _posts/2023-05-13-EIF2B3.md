# Information about EIF2B3 Gene

## Genetic Position
The EIF2B3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q32.1) and spans about 50 kilobases.

## Pathology
The EIF2B3 gene is associated with Vanishing White Matter (VWM) disease, which is a rare inherited disorder of the white matter of the brain. This disease is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration. Mutations in EIF2B3 gene lead to abnormalities in the EIF2B enzyme complex, which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. 

## Function
The EIF2B3 gene encodes a subunit of the EIF2B protein complex that is critical for protein synthesis and plays a crucial role in the regulation of translation initiation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the EIF2B3 gene.

## Related Disease
The EIF2B3 gene is associated with Vanishing White Matter (VWM) disease, which is a rare inherited disorder of the white matter of the brain. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for VWM disease. Treatment is mainly supportive and aimed at managing the symptoms. The prognosis for this disease is generally poor, with most patients experiencing progressive neurological deterioration.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response for VWM disease.
