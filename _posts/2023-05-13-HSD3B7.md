# Information about Gene HSD3B7

## Genetic Position
The gene HSD3B7 is located on chromosome 16q24.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the HSD3B7 gene have been associated with congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 5 (CBAS5). This genetic disorder affects the production of bile acids, leading to liver disease and other complications.

## Function
The HSD3B7 gene encodes an enzyme called 3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, which plays a key role in the synthesis of bile acids.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ser7Gly (rs116016706)
- p.Lys293Asn (rs41277725)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported for this gene.

## Related Disease
CBAS5 (Congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 5)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for CBAS5 typically involves management of liver disease symptoms and diet modifications. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and its complications.

## Drug Response
No specific drug response information is available for CBAS5.
