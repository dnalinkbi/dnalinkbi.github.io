# Gene: VAV1

## Information:

- **Gene function:** VAV1 is involved in regulating cellular signaling pathways that control proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It plays a crucial role in the activation of T cells and platelets, as well as the development of blood vessels.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

    - Gene ID: 7409
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 19q13.2
    - Other aliases: VAV, VAV-1, P95VAV, VAV1 oncogene
