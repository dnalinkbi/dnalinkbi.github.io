# Information about Gene UGT2B15

## Genetic Position and Aliases
The UGT2B15 gene is located on chromosome 4 (4q13.2) in humans. It is also known by other names such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15, UDPGT 2B15, and UGT2B21. 

## Function
The UGT2B15 gene encodes the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs and other substances within the body. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver, where it helps in the detoxification and elimination of drugs, toxins, and other harmful substances from the body.

## External IDs and Sites
The UGT2B15 gene has various external identifiers such as HGNC:12630, NCBI Entrez: 7363, Ensembl: ENSG00000138673, OMIM: 606571, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P54855.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported in the UGT2B15 gene. Some of the reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with their respective mutation types and dbSNP IDs are as follows:

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- |
| Missense Mutation | rs61750900 |
| Missense Mutation | rs8175347 |
| Missense Mutation | rs1427716 |
| Missense Mutation | rs17863783 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no significant evidence about somatic SNVs/InDels in the UGT2B15 gene.

## Related Disease
The mutations in the UGT2B15 gene are associated with various diseases such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, Parkinson's disease, and others. These diseases are primarily related to the drugs' metabolism and elimination pathway within the body.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of UGT2B15 gene mutations and related diseases depends on various factors such as the type and severity of the disease, the patient's age, and overall health. In most cases, the focus is on treating the underlying condition and managing symptoms. Since these mutations are involved in drug metabolism, personalized drug dosage or change in medication may be required. The prognosis of patients with UGT2B15 mutations or related diseases depends on how early the condition is diagnosed and treated.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that certain mutations in the UGT2B15 gene can affect drug metabolism and elimination, leading to drug toxicity or a decrease in drug efficacy. Therefore, the knowledge of UGT2B15 genotype can help in personalized drug dosing and avoiding potential side-effects.
