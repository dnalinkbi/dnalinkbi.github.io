## Information on Gene CRYBA4

### Genetic Position
CRYBA4 is a gene located on chromosome 22 at the position 22q11.23.

### Pathology
This gene is associated with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts. Congenital cataract refers to a clouding of the lens in the eye that is present at birth or develops during the first year of life. 

### Function
The protein encoded by this gene is a beta crystallin, a structural protein found in the lens that helps maintain lens transparency and refractive index. Beta crystallins are important in the process of light transmission in the eye.

### External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: 2505, NCBI Entrez: 1409, Ensembl: ENSG00000100315, OMIM: 123631, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P22914
- Aliases: CRYB4, beta B4 crystallin

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.206G>A(p.Gly69Asp) dbSNP ID: rs61744394
- c.199C>T(p.Arg67Cys) dbSNP ID: rs36015112
- c.68G>A(p.Arg23His) dbSNP ID: rs121912749

All mutations listed above are missense mutations, where a single nucleotide change results in an amino acid substitution.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for CRYBA4 in dbSNP.

### Related Diseases
Mutation in CRYBA4 has been shown to be associated with congenital cataracts, which can lead to visual impairment.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for congenital cataracts is generally surgical removal of the clouded lens and replacement with an intraocular lens implant. The prognosis for individuals with congenital cataracts varies depending on the severity of the cataract and any other associated eye conditions.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with CRYBA4 mutations.
