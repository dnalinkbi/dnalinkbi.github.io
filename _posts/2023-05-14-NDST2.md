## Information about Gene NDST2

**Genetic Position:** NDST2 is located at chromosome 6, position 12.1.

**Pathology:** NDST2 gene expression has been linked to the development of several types of cancer such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer.

**Function:** The NDST2 gene encodes an enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of sulfate groups to heparan sulfate. This process is critical for the proper functioning of cell-signaling pathways and morphogenesis during embryonic development.

**Related Disease:** Breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no specific treatment for NDST2 gene-related cancer. The prognosis and treatment options depend on the type and stage of cancer.

**Drug Response:** NDST2 gene can potentially serve as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
