## Gene CD79B

CD79B is a protein-coding gene also known as B29. It is located on chromosome 17 in humans and encodes the B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein beta chain. This protein plays an important role in the activation and differentiation of B cells.

### Function for gene
CD79B is essential for the development of B cells and plays a critical role in the activation of B cells through binding with CD79A forming the B-cell receptor complex. It also plays a role in the regulation of signaling pathways in B-cell lymphomas.

### Related disease
CD79B mutations have been identified in several B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). CD79B mutations have also been linked to the etiology of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis.

### Treatment and prognosis
The prognosis and treatment for CD79B-related diseases depend on the specific disease and its stage. DLBCL patients with CD79B mutations have poorer prognosis and may require more aggressive treatment approaches.

### Drug response
CD79B may serve as a potential therapeutic target for B-cell lymphomas. In a recent study, CD79B-directed immunotoxin treatment demonstrated potent efficacy in a preclinical model of CD79B+ DLBCL.
