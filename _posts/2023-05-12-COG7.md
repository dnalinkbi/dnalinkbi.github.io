# Gene COG7

## Genetic Position
The gene COG7 is located on chromosome 6p21.33.

## Pathology
Mutations in the COG7 gene have been associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type IIe (CDG2E), a rare genetic disorder that affects the glycosylation process, leading to abnormal protein and lipid glycosylation.

## Function
The COG7 gene encodes a subunit of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, which is responsible for maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus by tethering vesicles and facilitating protein transport.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

## Related Disease
Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type IIe (CDG2E)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CDG2E, and treatment is typically supportive and focused on managing symptoms. The prognosis for patients with CDG2E varies depending on the severity of the disease and the specific symptoms present.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on the drug response of patients with CDG2E.
