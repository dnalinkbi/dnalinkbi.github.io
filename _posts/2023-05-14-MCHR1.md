# Gene Information for MCHR1

The following information is about the MCHR1 gene, including its genetic position, pathology, and function.

## Gene Function

The MCHR1 gene codes for the Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 protein, which is a G-protein coupled receptor found in the brain. It plays a role in regulating feeding behaviors and energy homeostasis.
