## Gene: WDR62

### Genetic Position
Located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.12)

### Pathology
Mutations in the WDR62 gene have been associated with primary microcephaly, which is a disorder marked by a reduced head circumference and intellectual disability.

### Function
The WDR62 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis, which are important processes in the development of the brain.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the WDR62 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, which is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a reduced head circumference and intellectual disability.

### Treatment and Prognosis
No specific treatments are available for primary microcephaly caused by WDR62 mutations. Management is generally supportive and may involve physical and occupational therapy to help individuals with developmental delays. The prognosis for affected individuals varies depending on the severity of their condition.

### Drug Response
No drug responses have been reported for primary microcephaly caused by WDR62 mutations.
