## Gene CHAT

The CHAT gene (choline O-acetyltransferase) is located on chromosome 10q11.23 and its official symbol is CHAT. 

### Function
The CHAT gene encodes an enzyme called choline O-acetyltransferase, which is responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

### Related disease

Mutations in the CHAT gene can result in different medical conditions, including congenital myasthenic syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability caused by impaired neuromuscular transmission.

### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for congenital myasthenic syndrome caused by CHAT gene mutations can be challenging and usually involves symptomatic management with anticholinesterase drugs. The long-term prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the individual response to treatment.

### Drug response

There are no drugs currently approved specifically for the treatment of CHAT-related disorders. However, anticholinesterase agents such as Pyridostigmine and Neostigmine can be effective symptomatic treatments for some patients with congenital myasthenic syndrome.
