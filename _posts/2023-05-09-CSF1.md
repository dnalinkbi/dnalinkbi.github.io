# Information about Gene CSF1

## Gene and Genomic Location
The gene CSF1, also known as colony stimulating factor 1, is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 at position 5q33.2. Its external IDs include: 
- HGNC: 2435
- NCBI Entrez: 1435
- Ensembl: ENSG00000184348
- OMIM: 164770 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09603

## Aliases
CSF-1 has several aliases including: 
- M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor)
- Lanimostim
- MCSF
- CSF1P1
- FMS

## Function of Gene 
The CSF1 gene encodes a cytokine called Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1), which plays a vital role in the regulation of the immune system by stimulating the production and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages. Moreover, it has been shown to have a role in the maintenance of normal breast physiology with a potential implication in breast cancer. 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
A [search on dbSNP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=mutations+in+csf1) shows that CSF1 has several alternative variants with missense variants being the majority. Here are some of the ones with their rsIDs:

| AA Mutation   | Mutation Type | rsID     |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------|
| R54H         | Missense     | rs4833515 |
| T544M        | Missense     | rs148518524 |
| R112Q        | Missense     | rs397514570 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
A [search on COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/search?q=csf1) reveals that CSF1 has somatic mutations in different types of cancer with the majority being substitutions.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in CSF1 have been related to several diseases such as:
- Diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor
- Macrophage activation syndrome
- Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia 
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Atherosclerosis 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in CSF1. However, some current recombinant protein therapies have been developed to stimulate monocyte/macrophage production for related diseases such as MPS1 (Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1). The prognosis varies for each condition associated with CSF1 mutations.

## Drug Response
A [PharmGKB search](https://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA26629) shows no specifically documented drug response changes for CSF1.
