## Gene: MOCS1

### Function
The MOCS1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor which is required for the function of certain enzymes including sulfite oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase.

- Molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A (OMIM: 252150)
- Molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B (OMIM: 252160)

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for molybdenum cofactor deficiency, however, the condition can be managed with supportive treatments such as vitamin and mineral supplements, and regular medical monitoring. Prognosis is generally poor, with most affected individuals displaying severe developmental delays and neurological problems. 

### Drug response
There is currently limited information on drug responses for MOCS1 mutations. However, some forms of molybdenum cofactor deficiency have been treated with high-dose injections of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, a molecule which is related to the molybdenum cofactor.
