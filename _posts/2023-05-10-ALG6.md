## Gene Information
**Gene:** ALG6  
**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1:15,007,335-15,046,033  
**Aliases:** ALG6-CDG, CDG-Ic, CDG1C, DKFZp686F13124, DHSB, FLJ12691, FLJ21690, MGC117244  

## Function for Gene
The ALG6 gene encodes a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This protein catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor, which is required for the attachment of many proteins to the cell surface.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the ALG6 gene have been associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation type Ic (CDG-Ic). This condition can cause a wide range of symptoms including developmental delay, failure to thrive, abnormal bleeding, and seizures.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for CDG-Ic is primarily supportive and individualized to the symptoms of each patient. There is no cure for CDG-Ic, and the prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug treatment for CDG-Ic.
