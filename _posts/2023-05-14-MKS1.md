# Information about gene MKS1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position**: The gene MKS1 is located on chromosome 17q21.2.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the MKS1 gene are associated with Meckel syndrome (MKS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a combination of renal cystic dysplasia, central nervous system abnormalities, and polydactyly.
- **Function**: The MKS1 gene encodes a protein called meckelin, which is involved in ciliogenesis and centrosome biogenesis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the MKS1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the MKS1 gene are associated with Meckel syndrome (MKS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a combination of renal cystic dysplasia, central nervous system abnormalities, and polydactyly.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Meckel syndrome and treatment is mainly supportive.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specifically for MKS1 mutations.
