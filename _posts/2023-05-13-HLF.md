# Information about Gene HLF

## Genetic Position
The HLF gene is located on chromosome 17q21.1, specifically at position 17:37021599-37032983 (GRCh38/hg38).

## Pathology
Mutations in the HLF gene have been associated with various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer.

## Function
The HLF gene encodes for a transcription factor that plays a role in circadian rhythms and the regulation of gene expression.
