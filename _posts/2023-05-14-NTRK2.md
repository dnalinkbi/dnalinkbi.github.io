# Gene: NTRK2

### Function 
The NTRK2 gene encodes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, called TrkB, that is important for the development and function of the nervous system. It is involved in the regulation of neural plasticity, growth, differentiation, and survival.

### Related Disease
Mutations in NTRK2 have been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options vary depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms. Prognosis also varies and can depend on factors such as age of onset and extent of neurological damage.

### Drug Response
Drugs targeting the TrkB receptor are currently being developed and tested in clinical trials for the treatment of various diseases, such as depression and neuroblastoma.
