# Gene: CALM2

## Genetic Position
The CALM2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 at position 14.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CALM2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF).

## Function
The CALM2 gene encodes for calmodulin 2, a calcium-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell cycle progression, and gene transcription.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- G to C substitution at nucleotide position 396 (G396C) in exon 4, resulting in a V133L missense mutation (rs104894287) 
- G to A substitution at nucleotide position 644 (G644A) in exon 6, resulting in a E215K missense mutation (rs137852835)
- C to T substitution at nucleotide position 928 (C928T) in exon 8, resulting in a P310L missense mutation (rs137852836)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the CALM2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CALM2 have been associated with the following diseases:
- Long QT syndrome (LQTS)
- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)
- Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis for LQTS, CPVT, and IVF varies depending on the severity of the disease and the presence of other medical conditions.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response for patients with mutations in the CALM2 gene.
