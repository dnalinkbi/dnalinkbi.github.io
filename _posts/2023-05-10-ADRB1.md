# Information about Gene ADRB1

**Genetic Position:** The ADRB1 gene is located on chromosome 10q25.3. 

**Pathology:** Mutations in the ADRB1 gene have been associated with various diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure. 

**Function for Gene:** The ADRB1 gene encodes for beta-1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR), which is a G protein-coupled receptor. It plays a crucial role in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. 

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 238 
- NCBI Entrez: 153 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169252 
- OMIM: 109690 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08588 

**Aliases:** Beta-1 adrenergic receptor, ADRB1R, ARB1, B1AR 

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** 
- p.Gly389Arg (rs1801253)
- p.Ser49Gly (rs1801252)
- p.Arg389Gly (rs1801253)
- p.Gly16Arg (rs1801254)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No somatic mutations have been reported so far.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the ADRB1 gene have been associated with various diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Targeting β1-AR is a crucial treatment strategy for various heart diseases such as heart failure. Drugs such as beta-blockers can be used to target this receptor.

**Drug Response:** Drugs such as metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol are considered selective β1-AR blockers and are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart disease.
