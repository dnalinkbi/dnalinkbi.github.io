### Treatment, Prognosis, Drug Response:
- There is currently no cure for the genetic diseases caused by mutations of the KRT14 gene; treatments are usually palliative and depend on the severity of the symptoms.
- Treatment options may include topical or systemic medications, wound care, and physical therapy.
- Prognosis depends on the severity and extent of the disease.
- Drug response information not available at this time.
