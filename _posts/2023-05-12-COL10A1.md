# Information on Gene COL10A1

## Genetic Position
The COL10A1 gene, also known as collagen type X alpha 1 chain, is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q21-q22). 

## Pathology and Function
COL10A1 encodes the alpha-1 chain of type X collagen, which is a non-fibrillar collagen mainly expressed in mineralized tissue such as growth plate cartilage. Its function is to regulate the mineralization of cartilage during the process of endochondral ossification.

## Related Disease
One of the diseases related to COL10A1 is Schmid type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. This is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, bowed legs, and abnormalities in the metaphyses of long bones.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for patients with COL10A1-related disorders. Treatment is usually aimed at the individual symptoms of the patient, such as physical therapy for locomotor problems or surgery for severe spinal deformities.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response specific to COL10A1-related disorders.
