# Information on Gene CDC73

## 1. Genetic Position
The CDC73 gene is located on chromosome 1q31.2 and spans a genomic region of approximately 43.5 kilobases.

## 2. Pathology
Mutations in the CDC73 gene are associated with the development of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP), which is characterized by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone. Additionally, certain mutations in CDC73 have been linked to the development of parathyroid cancer.

## 3. Function for Gene
The CDC73 gene encodes a protein called parafibromin, which plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and cellular proliferation.

## 4. IDs and Aliases
- Entrez ID: 79577
- HGNC ID: 15755
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000133106
- OMIM ID: 607393
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O60832
- Aliases: HRPT2, HRPT2A, HTPC, MRT1

## 5. AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Mutations in the CDC73 gene can be of different types, such as missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, as well as large deletions or insertions. Some examples of mutations in CDC73 are:
- c.289C>T (p.Arg97Ter)
- c.312_315del (p.Ser104LeufsTer13)
- c.631C>T (p.Arg211Ter)
- rs137854427 (c.10C>T, p.Ser4Phe)

## 6. Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Examples of somatic mutations in CDC73 associated with the development of parathyroid tumors are:
- rs267607617 (c.643G>A, p.Arg215His)
- rs148990605 (c.637G>A, p.Cys213Tyr)

## 7. Related Disease
Mutations in CDC73 are associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) and parathyroid cancer.

## 8. Treatment and Prognosis
Surgery is the primary treatment for parathyroid tumors, with the extent of surgery depending on the tumor type and stage. Prognosis varies depending on various factors, such as tumor size, invasiveness, and metastasis.

## 9. Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeting CDC73 mutations. However, certain medications used to treat hypercalcemia and osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, may be used in conjunction with surgery.
