# Gene information for TMPO

## Genetic Position
The TMPO gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.31). It spans 481,745 bases of DNA.

## Pathology and Function
The TMPO gene encodes the protein Lamin-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2), which is an integral membrane protein found in the inner nuclear membrane of eukaryotic cells. LAP2 plays a crucial role in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization by interacting with chromatin and nuclear envelope proteins. Various studies have shown that TMPO gene mutations or dysfunctions are linked with multiple diseases, including cancer, muscular dystrophy, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

- OMIM: 188390
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60936
Aliases: LAP2, LEMD4, T12D8.1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations associated with the TMPO gene, including:
- p.Arg386Cys (rs2235018)
- p.Arg386His (rs2235019)
- p.Gly509Asp (rs61752313)
All these mutations are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
The TMPO gene is also found to have somatic mutations in various cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID associated with TMPO gene are:
- rs1801690
- rs2278504
- rs6887695
- rs5800864

## Related Diseases
- Breast Cancer
- Prostate Cancer
- Muscular Dystrophy
- Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of TMPO gene-related diseases depend on the specific disease and its stage.
For instance, in breast cancer, the prognosis and treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer. In Progeria, there is currently no cure, and treatment options aim to improve the quality of life of affected individuals.

## Drug Response
There is currently no standard treatment or targeted therapy for TMPO gene-related diseases. However, various drugs that target proteins interacting with the TMPO gene and LAP2 protein are under development and investigation.
