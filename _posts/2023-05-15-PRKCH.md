# Gene Information

## Gene Name and ID
Gene Name: PRKCH
ID: 5583

## Pathology
PRKCH gene is associated with various diseases such as cancers, autoimmune disorders, and neurological disorders.

## Function
PRKCH encodes a protein called protein kinase C eta, which is involved in various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is also involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation.
