# Information about Gene LIMK1

## Genetic Position
Gene LIMK1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at the position 7q11.22.

## Pathology
Mutations in LIMK1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including Williams syndrome, non-syndromic intellectual disability, and breast cancer.

## Function
LIMK1 gene encodes a protein called LIM kinase 1, which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization and microtubule dynamics. It plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, and cell migration.
