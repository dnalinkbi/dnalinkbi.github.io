# Gene POMC

## Information
- **Function:** The POMC (Pro-opiomelanocortin) gene encodes a prohormone that is cleaved to produce various peptides, including ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), alpha-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), and beta-endorphin. These peptides play important roles in regulating metabolism, immune response, and stress.

## Related Diseases
- POMC deficiency: a rare congenital disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, early-onset obesity, and red hair.
- ACTH deficiency: a condition where the adrenal gland does not produce enough cortisol, leading to adrenal insufficiency.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for POMC deficiency and ACTH deficiency includes hormone replacement therapy to supplement the missing hormones.
- The prognosis for individuals with POMC deficiency and ACTH deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- No significant drug response reported.
