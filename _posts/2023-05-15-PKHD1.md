# Information about gene PKHD1

## Genetic Position

The gene PKHD1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6p12.2). It spans a region of approximately 470 kb and contains 67 exons.

## Pathology

Mutations in the PKHD1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is a severe disease that affects the development and function of the kidneys and liver.

## Function for gene

The PKHD1 gene encodes the protein fibrocystin/polyductin, which is involved in the development and maintenance of kidney and liver function. It is involved in cellular signaling, cell adhesion, and regulation of cilia function.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the PKHD1 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the PKHD1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is a rare genetic disorder that affects children and infants. ARPKD can cause severe kidney dysfunction and damage, leading to kidney failure later in life.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known cure for ARPKD, and treatment options focus primarily on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. In severe cases, kidney or liver transplant may be necessary. The prognosis for individuals with ARPKD varies widely depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response

There are no known drugs that specifically target the PKHD1 gene. However, there are treatment options available for managing the symptoms of ARPKD, including antihypertensive drugs, diuretics, and antibiotics.
