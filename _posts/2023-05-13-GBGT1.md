## Gene GBGT1
- **Genetic position:** GBGT1 is a gene located on chromosome 9 (9q21.33) in humans.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in GBGT1 have been associated with various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune pancreatitis.
- **Function:** The GBGT1 gene encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a galactose residue to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of glycolipids and glycoproteins, creating a specific carbohydrate structure known as the Sd(a) antigen.

- **Related diseases:** 
    - Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Type 1 diabetes
    - Autoimmune pancreatitis
    - Hepatitis
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment of autoimmune diseases associated with GBGT1 mutations usually involves immunosuppressive drugs and/or biologics. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and its severity.
- **Drug response:** There is currently no known drug specifically targeting GBGT1 mutations, but some treatments used for autoimmune diseases may be effective in managing symptoms.
