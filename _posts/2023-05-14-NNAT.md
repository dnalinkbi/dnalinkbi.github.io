# Gene: NNAT

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Genomic coordinates: 20q11.23
- Strand: minus

## Pathology
NNAT has been associated with various diseases including neuroblastoma, mental retardation, and autism.

## Function
NNAT encodes a small, secreted protein that regulates neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It is expressed in the brain, specifically in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 10604
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125895
- NCBI Entrez: 4826
- OMIM: 606167
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16584
- Aliases: Nna1, sodium-activated nucleoside transporter

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No known pathogenic variants currently exist in the NNAT gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic SNVs/InDels currently exist in the NNAT gene.

## Related Disease
- Neuroblastoma (aberrant expression of NNAT has been linked to increased proliferation and tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma cells)
- Mental Retardation (decreased expression of NNAT has been linked to mental retardation)
- Autism (aberrant expression of NNAT has been linked to autism)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- No specific treatments currently exist for NNAT-related diseases. 
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the phenotype.

## Drug Response
- No specific drugs targeting NNAT currently exist.
