## Gene TRIP12

TRIP12 is a gene located on chromosome 2q36.1 and is also known as thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 12. It encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, involved in the degradation of proteins. The protein also interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor and enhances its transcriptional activity.

### Function for gene

TRIP12 encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, involved in the degradation of proteins. The protein also interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor and enhances its transcriptional activity.
