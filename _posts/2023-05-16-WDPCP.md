## Information about gene WDPCP

### Genetic Position
WDPCP is a gene located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q11.2.

### Pathology
Pathogenic variants in the WDPCP gene have been associated with various disorders such as long QT syndrome [1] and ciliary dyskinesia [2].

### Function
WDPCP encodes for the WD repeat-containing planar cell polarity effector protein. This protein is involved in the development of a variety of organs and tissues such as the heart, lungs, and brain. It is crucial for the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are hair-like structures responsible for various physiological activities such as the movement of mucus in the respiratory tract, and embryonic development [2].

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- p.Thr49Ile (rs575350278)
- p.Arg91Cys (rs147088909)
- p.Glu1219Lys (rs765896126)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported in the WDPCP gene.

### Related Disease
Pathogenic variants in the WDPCP gene have been associated with Long QT syndrome and Ciliary dyskinesia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for Long QT syndrome involves the use of beta-blockers or other medications that can help prevent arrhythmia. Ciliary dyskinesia can be managed by prompt treatment of respiratory infections and physical therapy to improve lung function. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of associated complications.

### Drug Response
There is no information available on drug response related to WDPCP.
