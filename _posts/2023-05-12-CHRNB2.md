## Gene Information

### Gene Name
CHRNB2 

### Function for Gene
The CHRNB2 gene encodes one of the subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor protein. This protein complex mediates synaptic transmission in the nervous system and has important roles in the control of nerve and muscle function.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the CHRNB2 gene have been associated with a variety of disorders, such as Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy type 5 (ADNFLE5), a rare form of epilepsy. Chrnb2-null mice showed a decreased motor performance compared to the wild type mice.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for ADNFLE5, but it can be controlled with antiepileptic drugs.

### Drug Response
There are various drugs available to treat epilepsy, such as carbamazepine, valproate, and zonisamide. The effectiveness of the drug may vary depending on the individual's genetic background.
