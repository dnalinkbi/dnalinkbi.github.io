# Gene PYCR1

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17 (17q23.2)
- **Pathology:** PYCR1 has been associated with several diseases including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, neuropathy, and metabolic disorders.
- **Function:** The PYCR1 gene encodes an enzyme called pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of proline, an amino acid that plays a critical role in various biological functions.
