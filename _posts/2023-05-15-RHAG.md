# Information about gene RHAG

- Function for gene: 
The RHAG gene encodes for Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG) which forms the Rh blood group antigen in red blood cells. RhAG is responsible for transporting ammonia and carbon dioxide across the erythrocyte membrane.

- Related disease:
Mutations in RHAG can lead to Rh deficient hemolytic anemia which is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the absence of Rh antigens on the surface of red cells, leading to hemolytic reactions during transfusion. 

- Treatment and prognosis:
The treatment of Rh-deficient hemolytic anemia involves transfusion with Rh-matched blood. Prognosis for the disease is generally good with proper management.

- Drug response: None reported
