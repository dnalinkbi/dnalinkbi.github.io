## Gene: MTPAP

### Genetic Position
- MTPAP gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 10q22.1.

### Pathology
- Several studies have suggested that mutations in the MTPAP gene are associated with mitochondrial disease and liver disease. 
- MTPAP gene mutation is responsible for autosomal recessive spastic ataxia with optic atrophy (ARSAOA) 
- Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome (MLS) is also caused by an MTPAP gene mutation.

### Function
- MTPAP gene is responsible for encoding methylthiouridine phosphorylase which catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A) present in mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA).

### Somatic SNVs/InDel with dbSNP ID
None reported

### Related Disease
- Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia with Optic Atrophy (ARSAOA) 
- Microphthalmia with Linear Skin Defects Syndrome (MLS) 
  
### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for ARSAOA and MLS. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive.

### Drug Response
- None reported.
