# Information on Gene EDNRA 

## Genetic Position
EDNRA is located at chromosome 4q31.2. 

## Pathology  
Variations in the EDNRA gene are associated with different pathologies such as hypertension, cerebral and myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and various cancers.

## Function
EDNRA encodes for endothelin receptor type A, which is a G-protein coupled receptor that binds endothelin-1 and facilitates vasoconstriction. The receptor is expressed on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells and has a strong impact on blood pressure regulation.

## Related Disease
EDNRA gene is associated with the following diseases: 
- Hirschsprung disease
- Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Essential hypertension
- Preeclampsia
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for genetic variations in EDNRA. However, different therapies such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can alleviate hypertension symptoms. The prognosis for pathologies related to EDNRA mutations varies depending on the individual's overall health status and the extent of cardiovascular damage.

## Drug Response
There is evidence to suggest that variations in EDNRA can affect drug response to medication such as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors. Studies have shown that individuals with specific EDNRA gene variations respond differently to calcium channel blockers than those without the variations.
