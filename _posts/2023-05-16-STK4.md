# Information about Gene STK4

## Genetic Position
The STK4 gene is located on chromosome 20 at the position 20.q13.3. It spans a length of approximately 285 kilobases and contains 19 exons.

## Pathology
STK4 is involved in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell polarity. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene have been linked to a number of diseases, including cancer, Lymphoproliferative syndrome, primary immunodeficiency, and thrombocytopenia.

## Function for gene
The STK4 gene encodes a protein called serine/threonine-protein kinase 4, which functions as a tumor suppressor and regulates cellular processes such as cell division, cell migration, and cell death.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several amino acid mutations have been reported in STK4 gene, including some SNVs and InDels. Some of the mutations are:
- S149N (dbSNP ID: rs113994125)
- G180R (dbSNP ID: rs113994157)
- C396R (dbSNP ID: rs143750246)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some somatic variations in STK4 gene are:
- c.1471C>T (dbSNP ID: rs150244745)
- c.937-4C>T (dbSNP ID: rs75942426)
- c.1058G>A (dbSNP ID: rs138421690)

## Related Disease
Mutations in STK4 gene have been associated with several diseases including Lymphoproliferative syndrome, primary immunodeficiency, thrombocytopenia and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeted therapy is one of the potential treatments for STK4-associated cancer. Some studies have suggested that inhibition of STK4 protein activity might be useful for cancer treatment. The prognosis depends on the type and stage of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is a limited amount of research on drug response in association with STK4 gene mutations.
