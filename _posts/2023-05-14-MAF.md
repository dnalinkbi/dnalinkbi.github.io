# Genetic Information for Gene MAF

## Summary

Gene MAF encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the MAF family of proteins. This gene is involved in many biological processes such as embryonic development, survival signal, differentiation, and cell proliferation. The MAF protein is also implicated in a number of human diseases including cancer, leukemia, and cataracts. 

## Function

The MAF protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes by binding to specific DNA sequences. Additionally, MAF plays a role in the survival and differentiation of various cell types involved in embryonic development.
