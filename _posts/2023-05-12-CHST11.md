### Gene: CHST11

#### Function:
CHST11 (Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11) gene encodes an enzyme that transfers sulfate groups to certain sugars, such as chondroitin, during the biosynthesis of proteoglycans.

#### External IDs:
- Gene ID (NCBI Entrez): 85303
- Genomic location: Chromosome 12,  q23.3 
- Aliases: C6ST-1, C6ST1, C6ST, HEC6ST, KSGal6ST, GST-3, GST3, HC6ST-1

#### Related disease:
- Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP)

#### Treatment and prognosis:
There is no known cure for DSAP. Patients usually undergo palliative therapies to remove the sun-damaged skin. If the lesions are severe or widespread, treatments such as cryotherapy, laser surgery, and topical creams containing tretinoin may be effective.

#### Drug response:
There is no documented drug response for DSAP.
