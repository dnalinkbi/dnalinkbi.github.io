## Gene SUMF1

### Genetic Position
The SUMF1 gene is located on chromosome 3, specifically on 3p26.1-p25.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SUMF1 gene can lead to multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability to degrade sulfate esters. This results in the accumulation of sulfatides in affected tissues, leading to central nervous system and musculoskeletal abnormalities.

### Function for Gene
The SUMF1 gene encodes for the enzyme sulfatase-modifying factor 1 (SUMF1), which is responsible for the post-translational activation of sulfatases.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations in the SUMF1 gene.

### Related Disease
Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), caused by SUMF1 gene mutations, is a rare lysosomal storage disorder with symptoms including developmental delays, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological symptoms.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MSD. Treatment is supportive and involves management of symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug treatment for MSD.
