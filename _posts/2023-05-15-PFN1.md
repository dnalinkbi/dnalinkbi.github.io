# Gene PFN1

### Genetic Position
The PFN1 gene is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17q25.3.

### Pathology
PFN1 gene mutations have been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies.

### Function
The PFN1 gene encodes profilin-1, which is a multifunctional protein involved in actin dynamics, signal transduction, and gene expression regulation.
