## Gene Information

### Gene: KISS1

The KISS1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q32.1) and has a length of approximately 26.54kb.

### Function

The KISS1 gene encodes a protein called kisspeptin which is responsible for regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by signaling the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This ultimately results in the stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the pituitary gland, which are necessary for normal reproductive function.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported in the KISS1 gene, including missense mutations and small insertions/deletions (InDels). However, there are no dbSNP IDs available for these mutations.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the KISS1 gene have been linked to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), which is a condition characterized by delayed or absent onset of puberty and infertility in both males and females.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for HH typically include hormone replacement therapy or the induction of puberty using GnRH analogs. Prognosis can vary depending on the underlying cause of HH and the individual's response to treatment.

### Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response specifically related to mutations in the KISS1 gene.
