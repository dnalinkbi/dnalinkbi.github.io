# BMP7 Gene Information

## Gene BMP7
- Function: The BMP7 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family. The BMP proteins are involved in embryogenesis and development of various tissues and organs. They also have important roles in bone formation and regeneration, and in regulating cell growth and differentiation.
- External IDs: 
   - Genomic Location: Chromosome 20 : 46,267,511-46,305,644
   - HGNC: 1070
   - NCBI Entrez: 655
   - Ensembl: ENSG00000119899
   - OMIM: 112265
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P18075
- Aliases: OP-1, Osteogenic Protein 1, BMP-7, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7

## Mutations
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

## Related Diseases and Treatment
- Related Diseases:
   - Renal Hypodysplasia (OMIM #610805)
   - Osteoporosis (OMIM #166710)
   - Bone Regeneration (OMIM #602573)
- Treatment and Prognosis:
   - BMP7 protein can be used therapeutically to promote bone growth and regeneration.
   - Inhibition of BMP7 may be a potential treatment option for some types of cancer.

## Drug Response
- Some drugs that target the BMP7 pathway have been investigated for their potential use in bone regeneration and cancer therapy.
