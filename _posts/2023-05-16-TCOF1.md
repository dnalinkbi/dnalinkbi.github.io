## Gene information for TCOF1

TCOF1 (Treacle ribosome biogenesis factor 1) is located on chromosome 5q32 and spans 758,554 base pairs. The gene is also known as: 

- External IDs: HGNC:11629, NCBI Gene:6949, Ensembl:ENSG00000168795, OMIM:606847, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q13428
- Aliases: Mandibulofacial dysostosis, Treacher Collins syndrome, TCOF, TCS, TCOF11, treacle ribosome biogenesis factor 1, and more.

## Function of TCOF1
The TCOF1 gene encodes for the treacle protein which is involved in the development of facial bones and other structures derived from the first and second pharyngeal arches.

## Mutations in TCOF1
Several mutations have been identified in the TCOF1 gene associated with Treacher Collins syndrome, a rare disorder of craniofacial development. These include both missense and frameshift mutations. dbSNP includes rs775824944, rs776076401, rs755872182, and more.

## Related diseases
Mutations in TCOF1 have been linked to Treacher Collins syndrome, which is characterized by craniofacial deformities. 

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for Treacher Collins syndrome involves surgical interventions to correct facial abnormalities, as well as speech and hearing therapy. Prognosis for individuals with Treacher Collins syndrome varies depending on the severity of the deformities and the degree of medical intervention they receive.

## Drug response
There are currently no drugs specifically designed to target Treacher Collins syndrome.
