## Gene: ECT2L

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location

ECT2L gene, also known as Epithelial cell-transforming sequence 2 oncogene-like, is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p21.31) in humans. 

### Pathology 

Mutations in ECT2L have been implicated in various cancers, such as lung, breast, and bladder cancers. Specifically, overexpression of ECT2L gene has been associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness in lung adenocarcinoma patients. 

### Function

ECT2L encodes a protein that belongs to the Rho family of small GTPases and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. It plays a key role in the control of mitosis and cytokinesis, contributing to the proper assembly of the cellular machinery involved in these processes.

### Related Disease

ECT2L mutations have been implicated in various cancers, such as lung, breast, and bladder cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Targeted therapies against ECT2L have not been developed yet. High expression of ECT2L has been linked to poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug response associated with ECT2L mutations.
