# Information about Gene EXOSC3

### Gene Information
- **Name:** Exosome component 3
- **Symbol:** EXOSC3
- **Aliases:** RRP40, PM/Scl-75
- **Location:** Chromosome 9; 9p13.3
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 29776
    - NCBI Entrez: 54536
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000122427
    - OMIM: 606489
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y3B4

### Function for Gene
The EXOSC3 gene codes for a protein that is a subunit of the exosome complex, which functions in the *3'-5' exonuclease* processing of almost all classes of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA. The exosome participates in numerous RNA processing events, including RNA degradation and maturation, and non-coding RNA surveillance. It also functions in DNA repair and the regulation of gene expression.

### Genetic Mutations and Pathology
The mutations found in the EXOSC3 gene lead to the development of *pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1b (PCH1b)*, an autosomal recessive brain disorder with multiple clinical features, including abnormal brain and cerebellar development, microcephaly, and developmental delay.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The dbSNP ID, amino acid (AA) mutations, and their types for EXOSC3 are listed below:

|dbSNP ID|AA Change|Mutation Type|
|--------|--------|-------------|
|rs387906622|p.Asp132Asn|Missense|
|rs387907049|p.Arg133Cys|Missense|
|rs775872293|p.Arg133Pro|Missense|
|rs398124756|p.Ile156Thr|Missense|
|rs752348083|p.Met158Ile|Missense|
|rs771509844|p.Thr204Ala|Missense|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are a few hundred somatic mutations listed on dbSNP for EXOSC3, a few of the dbSNP IDs are:

|dbSNP ID|Variant Type|
|--------|------------|
|rs149376890|SNV|
|rs138391939|SNV|
|rs199901744|SNV|

### Related Disease
EXOSC3 mutations are associated with *pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1b (PCH1b)*, an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to severe neurological symptoms.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for PCH1b, and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. The prognosis of this disorder is very poor, with most cases resulting in early childhood death.

### Drug Response
As of now, there is no specific drug specifically developed for the treatment of PCH1b. However, clinical trials are underway to develop novel therapies for this disorder.
