# Gene: FDFT1

## Genetic Position
FDFT1 is located on chromosome 8 at position q24.1 and spans 7.3 kb.

## Function
FDFT1 is involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and plays a key role in the regulation of cellular cholesterol levels. It encodes the enzyme squalene synthase, which catalyzes the committed step of cholesterol biosynthesis by converting farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for FDFT1 in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in FDFT1 have been associated with a variety of diseases, including:
- Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
- Congenital Heart Disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome, but treatment involves managing symptoms such as feeding problems, developmental delays, and behavioral issues. For congenital heart disease, treatment options depend on the specific type and severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
FDFT1 has been identified as a potential target for cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins.
