## Gene DPM3

### Genetic Position
DPM3 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 at position 22.1.

### Function
DPM3 encodes for a protein that is a subunit of dolichol-phosphate mannosyltransferase enzyme complex in the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme complex is involved in the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. 

### External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location 
External IDs for DPM3 gene are as follows:
- HGNC: 30814
- NCBI Entrez: 10659
- Ensembl: ENSG00000158494
- OMIM: 603748
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O94811

Aliases for DPM3 gene are as follows:
- CDG1S 
- CDG1S-ALG8 
- C3orf58
- dolichol-phosphate-mannose biosynthesis polypeptide 3, CMP-sialic acid transporter

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported missense mutations in DPM3 gene. The following is a list of some of the reported mutations:
- p.Cys37Arg, rs267607040
- p.Arg214His, rs758574318
- p.Leu56Pro, rs762681617

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for DPM3 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in DPM3 gene are associated with Congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1S (CDG1S), which is a rare metabolic disorder. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for CDG1S. Treatment mainly focuses on managing the symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response for CDG1S.
