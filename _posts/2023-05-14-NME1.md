# Gene: NME1

## Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: 17q21.3

## Pathology:
Mutations in NME1 have been linked to various cancers including breast and colorectal cancer.

## Function:
NME1 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase 1) plays a role as a metastasis suppressor gene and regulates cell differentiation and apoptosis.
