# Gene Information for TNS3

## Genetic Position
- TNS3 is located on human chromosome 7
- Location: 7q31.2

## Pathology
- TNS3 gene is associated with several diseases such as cancer, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease. 
- TNS3 is also linked to the regulation and function of cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation.

## Function for Gene
- TNS3 gene encodes a protein called tensin-3, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling and adhesion to the extracellular matrix.
- Tensin-3 is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which affect cell migration and division.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment of the TNS3-related disease depends on the specific condition and its severity.
- The prognosis of TNS3-related diseases also varies depending on the type and stage of the condition.

## Drug Response
- Researches have been conducted to investigate the drug efficacy against cancer cells that are associated with TNS3 expression, but there is no approved drug yet known to target TNS3.
