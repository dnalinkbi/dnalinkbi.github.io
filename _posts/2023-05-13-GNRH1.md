# Information about gene GNRH1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 8
- Start Position: 26,543,874 bp
- End Position: 26,550,202 bp


## Pathology and Function
- The GNRH1 gene provides instructions for making a hormone called Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which is produced by the hypothalamus. This hormone helps in regulating the production of reproductive hormones from the pituitary gland. 
- Mutations in GNRH1 gene can lead to changes in the regulation of reproductive hormones resulting in reproductive disorders such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000102379
- OMIM ID: 152760
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P01148
- Genomic Location: NC_000008.11 (26543874..26550202)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID have been reported for the GNRH1 gene.


## Related Disease
- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 7 with or without anosmia (HH7)


## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism depends on the underlying cause and may involve hormone replacement therapy or fertility treatments.
- Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition.


## Drug Response
- There is no drug response information available for the GNRH1 gene.
