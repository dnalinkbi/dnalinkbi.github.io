## Gene Information

### Gene Name and ID
- Gene Name: KANK1 (KN Motif And Ankyrin Repeat Domains 1)
- Gene ID: HGNC:29272

### Genomic Location and Aliases
- Chromosome: 9
- Location: 9q31.2
- Aliases: ANKRD15, FLJ90520, KIAA1769

## Gene Function
KANK1 is a scaffolding protein involved in cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling. It interacts with actin and microtubules to regulate cell shape, motility, and division. KANK1 also plays a role in linking the cancer-related Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway to the cytoskeleton.
