# Analysis of Gene TFAP2A

## Basic Information
- **Gene Name:** TFAP2A
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 6:25,829,281-25,862,188
- **Aliases:** Activating Enhancer-Binding Protein 2 Alpha, AP-2 Transcription Factor A

## Function
The TFAP2A gene encodes a member of the AP-2 family of transcription factors. These proteins are involved in various developmental processes, including the formation of the neural crest, skeletal development, and facial development. TFAP2A specifically plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation during development.
