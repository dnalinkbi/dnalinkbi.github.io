# Gene B3GNT7

## Genetic Position
B3GNT7 (UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 7) is located on chromosome 12q23.1.

## Pathology and Function
B3GNT7 encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to galactose (Gal) in the formation of N-glycans. N-glycans are involved in various cellular processes including protein folding, stability, and localization. It also plays a role in the regulation of immune responses and oncogenesis.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- B3GNT7 mutations are quite rare. Only a few mutations have been reported so far. 
- One example of a missense mutation is p.Arg135His (rs145124242) which affects the glycosyltransferase domain of B3GNT7. This mutation leads to various developmental and neurological disorders such as developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and abnormal brain morphology.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- B3GNT7 somatic mutations have not been identified in any malignancy so far.

## Related Disease
- B3GNT7 mutations are associated with Tetrology of Fallot, a congenital heart disease characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for Tetrology of Fallot. Surgical intervention is the only treatment option which can improve patient outcomes.

## Drug Response
- There is no known drug currently that specifically targets B3GNT7.
