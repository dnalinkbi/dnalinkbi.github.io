## Gene: FEM1A

### Basic Information
- **Function for gene:** FEM1A encodes a protein that plays a role in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. It binds to and ubiquitinates the tumor suppressor protein TP53, leading to its degradation. FEM1A also regulates the cell cycle progression by controlling the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and stimulating the proteasomal degradation of mitotic cyclins.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
Somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) and InDels (Insertions and Deletions) are the genetic variations that occur specifically in the somatic cells and not in the germ cells. Following are some of the somatic variants found in FEM1A gene with their dbSNP ID.

| Variant | Type | dbSNP ID |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| c.557+4A>G | Splice site | rs396032455 |
| c.958_961delTTAG | InDel | rs1057519128 |
| c.1182G>A | Missense | rs760971708 |
| c.1182G>C | Missense | rs760971708 |
| c.958_961delTTAG | InDel | rs1057519128 |

### Related Disease
- **Phenotypes associated with variants in FEM1A:** Germline variants in FEM1A are reported to be associated with Fanconi anemia subtype FA-P (Fanconi anemia complementation group P). Germline variants in FEM1A are also associated as moderate-risk susceptibility genes for breast cancer. Some of the somatic variants in FEM1A have been implicated in various cancer types such as breast, liver, and lung cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for FEM1A-related diseases, as the role of FEM1A is still being explored. The prognosis varies depending upon the severity of the disease and the presence of any comorbidities.  

### Drug Response
No specific drug response information is available for FEM1A-related diseases.
