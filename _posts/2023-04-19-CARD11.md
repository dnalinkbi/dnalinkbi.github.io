# CARD11 Gene

**Function:** The CARD11 gene encodes a protein called caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARMA1), which plays a critical role in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a complex system that regulates the immune response.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 1390 
- NCBI Entrez: 84433 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000170416
- OMIM: 607210
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BXL7

**Aliases:** BIMP3, CARMA1, IMD11, CBM complex protein, Caspase recruitment domain family member 11

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

| Protein Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ala675Val | Missense | rs672601111 |

**Related Disease:** CARD11 mutations have been linked to several diseases, including B-cell lymphoma, recurrent infections, and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). 

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for CARD11-related diseases generally involves targeting the immune system, either through immunosuppressive drugs or bone marrow transplantation. Prognosis can vary depending on the specific disease and individual. 

**Drug Response:** There is limited information regarding drug response specifically for CARD11 mutations, but targeted therapies for the immune system may be effective in treating associated diseases.
