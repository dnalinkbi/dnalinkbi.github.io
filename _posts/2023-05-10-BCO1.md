# Gene BCO1

## Information

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 16, from base pair 67,824,440 to base pair 67,831,250.

- **Pathology**: Variants in the BCO1 gene can cause carotenoid pigmentation disorders such as blond hair because the gene encodes the beta-carotene oxygenase 1 enzyme that converts beta-carotene to vitamin A. Additionally, genetic variations in the BCO1 have been associated with several diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).

- **Function**: The BCO1 gene provides instructions to make an enzyme that carries out the first step in the conversion of dietary provitamin A carotenoids into vitamin A.

- **External IDs and Aliases:** 
    - HGNC ID: HGNC:13656
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000204931
    - NCBI Entrez: 83869
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9HAY6
    - Other aliases: BCMO1, BCMO1a, BCO, BCOX1, beta-carotene oxygenase 1, EFTUDC2, FLJ20332, FLJ43814

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
    - p.Gln100Arg: rs750133015
    - p.Ala292Val: rs750476780
    - p.Ala219Val: rs114471208
    - p.Ser18Cys: rs71181145
    - p.Asn143Tyr: rs750133017

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

- **Related diseases:** Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and carotenoid pigmentation disorders.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Currently, there are no specific treatments for BCO1 gene-related disorders. However, dietary modifications and vitamin A supplements may help alleviate the symptoms of these disorders.

- **Drug response**: None reported.
