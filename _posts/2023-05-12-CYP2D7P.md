## Gene CYP2D7P

- **Function for gene:** The CYP2D7P gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme, which is involved in drug metabolism and catalyzes the hydroxylation of various substrates.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

  - Gene ID: [1559](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1559))
  - Genomic location: [22q13.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1559#genomic-positions-chromosome))
  - Aliases: CYP2D7, CYPIID7, cytochrome P450 2D7, cytochrome P450 IID7

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

  - There are several reported variants for CYP2D7P, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Some of the reported mutations and their dbSNP IDs are:

    - rs769157404 (c.863_864insC)
    - rs55933508 (c.100C>T)
    - rs35742686 (c.121C>T)
    - rs28371706 (c.164C>A)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

  - There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for CYP2D7P.

- **Related disease:**

  - Variations in CYP2D7P have been shown to be associated with altered drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, which may lead to differential drug responses.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**

  - Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific drug being metabolized and the individual's genetic makeup.

- **Drug response:**

  - Genetic variations in CYP2D7P can affect the metabolism and clearance of various drugs, leading to altered drug responses and potential adverse effects.
