## Gene Information for PHF3

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location
The gene PHF3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1, specifically at 1q31.3. 

### Pathology and Function
PHF3 (plant homeodomain finger protein 3) is a chromatin-associated protein that plays a role in gene regulation and controls the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. Studies have suggested that PHF3 has a role in the development of cancer and other diseases.
