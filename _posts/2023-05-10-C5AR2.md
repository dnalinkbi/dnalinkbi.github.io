# Gene: C5AR2

## Information

- **Gene Function**: C5a receptor 2 encodes a receptor for C5a and C5a-des-Arg, which are anaphylatoxins produced during the complement cascade. C5aR2 acts as a negative regulator of the C5a-C5AR1 signaling pathway and modulates immune and inflammatory responses.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location**:
    - Aliases: C5L2, GPR77, C5aR-like receptor 2
    - Chromosome: 19
    - Genomic position: 19p13.3
    
- **External Sites**:
    - HGNC: 5473
    - NCBI Entrez: 27202
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000130477
    - OMIM: 605244
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BXW7

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 
There are several missense and nonsense mutations found in the C5AR2 gene. Some of the common mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

| AA mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID   |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| R15X        | Nonsense      | rs149545098|
| R86X        | Nonsense      | rs76759499 |
| H356R       | Missense      | rs143835056|
| R37H        | Missense      | rs143835097|
| E275A       | Missense      | rs143835094|

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
There are several somatic mutations found in the C5AR2 gene with their corresponding dbSNP IDs. Some of them are:

| SNV/InDel          | dbSNP ID    |
|--------------------|-------------|
| c.57G>A            | rs758181777 |
| c.285-1G>A         | rs747236827 |
| c.492+2T>C         | rs758523007 |
| c.866T>C           | rs1063190   |

- **Related Disease**: Several studies have suggested that mutations or altered expression of C5AR2 can cause various diseases such as sepsis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.

- **Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no FDA-approved drug available that specifically targets C5AR2. However, scientists are investigating various drugs that can modulate the C5aR2 signaling pathway to improve the treatment and prognosis of the associated diseases.

- **Drug Response**: Some of the drugs that target the C5aR2 signaling pathway are Avdoralimab (IPH5401), TLR9 Agonists, and mAbs against C5L2. These drugs have shown promising results in preclinical studies and some of them are currently in clinical trials.
