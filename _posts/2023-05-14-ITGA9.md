# Gene: ITGA9

## Genetic Position
The ITGA9 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position q21.3.

## Pathology
Studies have linked ITGA9 gene mutations to various diseases, including cancer and Crohn's disease. For example, altered expression of ITGA9 has been observed in ovarian and gastric cancers, indicating its potential role in these cancers' development and progression.

## Function
The ITGA9 gene encodes an integrin alpha subunit protein that is a member of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules. This protein is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells and certain immune cells, where it plays a role in the adhesion and migration of cells. It is involved in cell signaling pathways and is essential for normal cell development and function.

## Related Disease
Studies have associated ITGA9 gene mutations with several diseases, including:
- Crohn's disease
- Gastric cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Colorectal cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
No specific treatment is available for ITGA9 gene mutations. However, treatments for Crohn's disease and cancer are available, depending on the specific case. As for prognosis, ITGA9 gene mutations can lead to more severe outcomes, depending on the associated disease.

## Drug Response
Studies are currently ongoing to determine the drug response of ITGA9 gene mutations.
