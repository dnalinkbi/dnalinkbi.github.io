## RBM8A Gene Information

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 1 (1p35.3-p34.3)
- **Pathology**: The mutations in the RBM8A gene are associated with different types of genetic disorders such as thrombocytopenia-absent-radius (TAR) syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and some cancers.
- **Function**: The RBM8A gene encodes for the RNA binding motif protein 8A, which is involved in various cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, and translation.

#### Related Diseases

- Thrombocytopenia-absent-radius (TAR) syndrome
- Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
- Cancer

#### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no definitive cure for TAR or SMA, and treatment is largely symptomatic and supportive.
- Treatment for cancer will depend on the type and stage of the cancer and may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.

#### Drug Response

- Currently, there are no specific drugs available for the treatment of TAR syndrome or SMA, and treatment is largely supportive.
- Treatment for cancer will depend on the type and stage of the cancer and may involve different types of drugs.
