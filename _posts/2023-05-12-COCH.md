## Information about Gene COCH

**Genetic Position:** COCH gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 at position 31.1.

**Pathology:** COCH gene mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant disorder known as DFNA9 (Deafness, Autosomal Dominant 9) that causes sensorineural hearing loss.

**Function:** COCH gene encodes cochlin protein, which is a component of extracellular matrix of the inner ear and helps in the formation of tectorial membrane in the cochlea. 

**External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: HGNC:2175
- NCBI Entrez: 1690
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100979
- OMIM: 603196
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43405

The genomic location of COCH is 14q31.1, and its aliases include COCH-5B2, DFNA9, and COCH5B2. 

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

Several missense mutations have been reported in the COCH gene, such as p.Trp181Arg, p.Asp115Asn, p.His100Arg, and p.Thr112Met. These mutations are associated with DFNA9 hearing loss. Some of the dbSNP IDs for these mutations are rs104894216, rs104894217, rs104894218, rs267606822, and rs104894219.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

Currently, there is no information available for somatic SNVs/InDels in COCH gene.

**Related Disease:**

DFNA9 (Deafness, Autosomal Dominant 9), characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, is caused by mutations in the COCH gene.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

As of now, there is no definitive treatment available for DFNA9 hearing loss. Prognosis is variable depending on the severity of hearing loss, age of onset, and progression rate.

**Drug Response:**

Currently, there is no information available on drug response for COCH gene mutations.
