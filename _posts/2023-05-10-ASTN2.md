# Gene: ASTN2

## Information
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 9q33.1
- **Pathology**: ASTN2 has been found to play a role in neuronal migration in the brain. Mutations in ASTN2 have been associated with primary and non-syndromic intellectual disability.
- **Function**: Encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell migration during brain development.
- **Aliases**: KIAA1430
- **External IDs**:
    - HGNC: 16178
    - NCBI Entrez: 413986
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000108652
