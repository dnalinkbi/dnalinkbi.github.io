## Gene ARL6

- Function for gene: The ARL6 gene encodes a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor-like family of small GTP-binding proteins. The protein is involved in multiple cellular processes, including intracellular vesicle trafficking, cilia formation, and protein trafficking to the cilium.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with gene ARL6.

- Related disease: ARL6 mutations have been associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) type 3, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, and cognitive impairment.

- Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no known cure for BBS, and treatment is mainly supportive, focusing on the management of symptoms and associated problems. Patients with BBS require ongoing monitoring and multidisciplinary care throughout their lives.

- Drug response: Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeted towards gene ARL6 or BBS.
