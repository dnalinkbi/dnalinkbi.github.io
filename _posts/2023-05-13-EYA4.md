# Information about Gene EYA4

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 6
- Location: 6q23.2

## Pathology
EYA4 gene mutations are associated with autosomal dominant hearing loss and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

## Function
EYA4 encodes a transcriptional activator protein that plays a role in the development and function of organs such as the ear and heart.
