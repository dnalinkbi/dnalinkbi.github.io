# Gene GCLM Information

## Basic Information
- Gene Name: Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase Modifier Subunit (GCLM)
- Gene Location: Chromosome 1p22.1
- Aliases: GLCLM, GCSM

## Function
The GCLM gene encodes a subunit of the glutamate-cysteine ligase, which is responsible for the synthesis of the major intracellular antioxidant, glutathione. Glutathione plays a crucial role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles.

## Related Diseases
- Cancer
- Alzheimer's disease
- Parkinson's disease
- Diabetes

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in the GCLM gene. However, research has shown that increasing the levels of glutathione may be beneficial for treating diseases related to oxidative stress.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to mutations in the GCLM gene.
