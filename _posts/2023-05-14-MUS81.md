# Gene MUS81

## Genetic Position
MUS81 is located on chromosome 18 at position 18q21.31.

## Pathology and Function
MUS81 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and repair. It is involved in the resolution of DNA structures that arise during replication and DNA repair. MUS81 functions as a nuclease that cleaves branched DNA structures, such as Holliday junctions, to facilitate DNA repair.

## Related Disease
Defects in MUS81 have been associated with multiple genetic disorders such as Fanconi anemia, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for MUS81-related disorders. Management is typically focused on treating symptoms and preventing complications. The prognosis largely depends on the severity of the disorder.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response for MUS81-related disorders, and more research is needed in this area.
