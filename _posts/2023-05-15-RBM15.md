## Gene RBM15

RBM15 (RNA-binding protein 15), also known as OTT (One Twenty Two) or OTT1 is a gene located on chromosome Xq13.1. This gene is associated with RNA binding functions that are involved in RNA processing, alternative splicing, and gene regulation. The RBM15 protein also functions as a transcription factor in hematopoietic stem cells and regulates cell differentiation through the JAK-STAT pathway.

### Gene function
The RBM15 gene is involved in RNA metabolism and regulates gene expression through alternative splicing and gene regulation. This gene also functions as a transcription factor in hematopoietic stem cells and regulates cell differentiation through the JAK-STAT pathway.
