# Information about gene MUC3A

## Genetic position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** The MUC3A gene is located on chromosome 7q22.1.
- **Function:** The MUC3A gene encodes a membrane-bound mucin that is expressed in intestinal epithelia. This protein plays a role in maintaining mucosal homeostasis in the gut by providing a protective mucus barrier and serving as a ligand for bacterial adhesion.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in MUC3A have been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer, with studies suggesting that decreased expression of the protein may contribute to tumor progression and invasion. 

## External IDs, Aliases, and External Sites
- **External IDs:** MUC3A is also known as mucin 3A, intestinal (MUC3A), MUC3, and GA733-2. 
- **Genomic Location:** MUC3A is located on chromosome 7q22.1.
- **Aliases:** MUC3, MUC3A, GA733-2
