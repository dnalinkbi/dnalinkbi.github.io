## ARNT Gene Information

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location

- **Gene**: Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT)
- **Chromosome**: 1
- **Start Position**: 120,730,903 bp
- **End Position**: 120,791,684 bp

### Pathology

ARNT gene is known to be associated with various diseases including cancer, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, and polycythemia. 

### Function

ARNT plays a key role in regulating the expression of several genes. It forms a heterodimer complex with other proteins, such as AhR, HIF-1Î±, and BMAL1, and binds to specific promoter sequences of target genes to activate or repress their transcription.
