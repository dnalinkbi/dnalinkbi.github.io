# Gene HOXD@

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2: 176530727-176539090
- **Pathology:** This gene is associated with various diseases related to skeletal malformations, such as Syndactyly and Brachydactyly.
- **Function for Gene:** HOXD@ belongs to the homeobox family of genes that encode transcription factors regulating development and cellular differentiation. They play a crucial role in the development of limbs, specifically the formation and patterning of fingers and toes.
- **Aliases:** HOXD13, Homeobox D13, Polydactyly-syndactyly-phocomelia syndrome, HD13
- **External IDs:**
     - HGNC: 5026
     - NCBI Entrez: 3239
     - Ensembl: ENSG00000144531
     - OMIM: 142989
     - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43364
