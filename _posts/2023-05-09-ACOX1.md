# Information on ACOX1 Gene

ACOX1 gene encodes for acyl-CoA oxidase 1, which is involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisomes. Below is detailed information about ACOX1 gene:

## Function for gene
- This gene encodes for acyl-CoA oxidase 1, which catalyzes the first step of the fatty acid beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. 
- The encoded protein oxidizes straight-chain and branched-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs.

## External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- Gene ID: 51
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17: 44113587-44129243
- Gene aliases: AOX, PMP20, SCPX

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.50G>A (p.Ala17Thr) rs2075291
- c.545C>T (p.Arg182Trp) rs61733143

## Related disease
- Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency: It is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ACOX1 gene.

## Treatment and prognosis
- No specific treatment is available for peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. Treatment is symptomatic and may include the use of a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and its symptoms.

## Drug response
- No information is available on drug response.
