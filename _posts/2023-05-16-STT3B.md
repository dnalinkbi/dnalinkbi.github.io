# Information about Gene STT3B

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 3
- Location: 3p24.1

## Pathology
- STT3B is a gene associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ic.
- CDG type Ic is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal protein glycosylation, leading to various symptoms such as developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and liver dysfunction.

## Function for Gene
- STT3B encodes a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which catalyzes the transfer of a high-mannose oligosaccharide from dolichol-linked oligosaccharide to asparagine residues on nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
- This glycosylation process is essential for proper protein folding and function.

## External IDs, Aliases, and External Sites
- Gene ID: 55829
- HGNC ID: 17321
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163742
- NCBI Entrez: 55829
- OMIM: 608922
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H2X9
- Aliases: CDG1C, KCP1, MRT11, STT3, STT3A, hSTT3A, hSTT3B

## AA Mutation List and Types with dbSNP ID
- STT3B mutations in CDG type Ic are typically missense mutations.
- Some reported missense mutations in STT3B and their dbSNP IDs include:
    - c.28C>T (p.Pro10Leu) rs193920139
    - c.375C>T (p.Arg125Trp) rs772342375
    - c.695G>A (p.Trp232*) rs879255746
- Other types of mutations, such as frameshift, nonsense, and splice site mutations, have also been reported.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are currently no reported somatic mutations in STT3B.

## Related Disease
- STT3B mutations are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ic (CDG Ic).

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for CDG type Ic, and treatment is typically supportive and based on the individual's symptoms.
- Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of symptoms and disease progression.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug or treatment for CDG type Ic.
