# Information about gene RUNX1T1

## Genetic Position and Aliases

- **Gene Symbol:** RUNX1T1
- **Genetic Location:** Chromosome 8 (8q22.3)
- **Aliases:** CBFA2T1, MTG8

## Function for gene

The RUNX1T1 gene encodes for a protein called CBFA2T1, which is a transcriptional corepressor that binds to DNA and represses gene expression. CBFA2T1 plays a role in normal hematopoiesis, the process by which blood cells are formed, and has been implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

## Related disease

Mutations in the RUNX1T1 gene have been associated with several types of leukemia, including AML, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for leukemia depends on the specific subtype and severity of the disease. Prognosis can also vary widely, though mutations in the RUNX1T1 gene have generally been associated with poorer outcomes.

## Drug response

There is limited research on drug response specific to mutations in the RUNX1T1 gene, though some studies have suggested that certain drugs used in leukemia treatment may be less effective in patients with RUNX1T1 mutations.
