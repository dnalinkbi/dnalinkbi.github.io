# Information on gene GRID2

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** GRID2
- **Aliases:** GluD2, Glutamate receptor delta-2 subunit
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 4q22.1

## Function for Gene
GRID2 encodes for GluN2, a subunit of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The NMDA receptor is crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. The GluN2 subunit is involved in the process of synaptic plasticity, a mechanism that is essential for learning and memory formation.

## Related Disease
GRID2 mutations have been implicated in the development of spinocerebellar ataxia 18 (SCA18), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncoordinated movement, ataxia, and cognitive impairment.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for SCA18, and treatment typically involves managing symptoms such as difficulty with movement and communication. The prognosis for individuals with SCA18 varies widely depending on the severity of symptoms. Some patients experience a milder disease course, while others develop rapidly progressive symptoms leading to severe disability.

## Drug Response
There is no medication approved specifically for the treatment of SCA18. However, medication that enhances glutamate signaling activity has been shown to have potential therapeutic benefits in preclinical studies.
