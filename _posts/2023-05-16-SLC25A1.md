## Related Disease
- Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

## Treatment and Prognosis
- No known cure for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
- Treatment options include medications, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, to slow the progression of liver damage
- Prognosis depends on the stage of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment

## Drug Response
- Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to slow the progression of liver damage in some patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
