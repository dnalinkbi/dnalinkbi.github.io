## Gene CHSY3
### Genomic Position
CHSY3 is located on chromosome 17q25.3.

### Function
CHSY3 encodes a protein that is responsible for sulfation of keratan, a type of glycosaminoglycan, in cornea and cartilage. This sulfation is important for the structure and function of these tissues.

### Pathology
Mutations in CHSY3 have been associated with certain corneal dystrophies, such as keratoglobus and macular corneal dystrophy.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations associated with CHSY3, including: 
- c.1609C>T (p.Arg537Trp) with dbSNP ID rs61751256
- c.1291C>T (p.Arg431Ter) with dbSNP ID rs786201061
- c.175G>T (p.Gly59Val) with dbSNP ID rs150732745

All of these mutations are missense or nonsense mutations, which can lead to a non-functional or partially functional protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels are currently associated with CHSY3.

### Related Disease
Mutations in CHSY3 have been linked with certain corneal dystrophies, such as keratoglobus and macular corneal dystrophy. These diseases can lead to vision impairment or blindness.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for corneal dystrophies depends on the specific disease and severity. In some cases, a corneal transplant may be necessary. Prognosis also varies based on the specific disease and individual factors.

### Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically targeting CHSY3 mutations or associated corneal dystrophies.
