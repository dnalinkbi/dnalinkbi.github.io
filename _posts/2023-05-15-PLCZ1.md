## Information about gene PLCZ1

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

Gene PLCZ1 is located on the long arm of the X chromosome at position Xq24. It encodes a protein called phospholipase C zeta 1 (PLCζ), which plays a crucial role in fertilization by triggering the release of calcium ions inside the egg. Pathologically, mutations in the PLCZ1 gene have been associated with male infertility and oocyte activation failure in females.

### Function for gene

PLCζ is involved in egg activation, a process that occurs during fertilization and is essential for the formation of a healthy embryo. When sperm cells enter the egg, they deliver their DNA and a small amount of PLCζ protein. This protein triggers a series of events that lead to the release of calcium ions from internal stores in the egg, which are necessary for starting embryonic development.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations reported in the PLCZ1 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations. Some of these mutations, along with their dbSNP IDs and effect on the amino acid sequence of PLCζ, are listed below:

| Mutation     | dbSNP ID | Amino acid change |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| c.1687C>T    | rs150790186 | p.Arg563* |
| c.202C>T     | rs786200507 | p.Ser68Phe |
| c.632G>A     | rs1610731 | p.Cys211Tyr |
| c.682G>C     | rs17852848 | p.Gly228Ala |
| c.1078-6T>A  | rs201418642 | - |
| c.1697G>T    | rs138326954 | p.Glu566* |
| c.1732C>T    | rs084327558 | p.Arg578* |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in the PLCZ1 gene have not been reported so far.

### Related disease

Mutations in the PLCZ1 gene have been associated with male infertility and oocyte activation failure in females. Male infertility can be caused by various factors, including sperm abnormalities, obstruction, or hormonal disorders. In some cases, genetic mutations like those in the PLCZ1 gene can also contribute to infertility.

### Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment available for male infertility caused by PLCZ1 mutations. In vitro fertilization (IVF) with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been successful in some cases, where sperm can be extracted and injected directly into the egg. However, the success rate of this treatment varies depending on the severity of the mutation and other factors.

### Drug response

There is no known drug that targets PLCζ directly. However, some drugs used in IVF protocols may enhance the chances of fertilization in cases of oocyte activation failure.
