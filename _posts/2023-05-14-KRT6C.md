# Gene: 

KRT6C

## Information

### Genetic Position:

The gene KRT6C is located on chromosome 12q13.13.

### Pathology:

Mutations in KRT6C have been associated with pachyonychia congenita (PC), which is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects the skin, nails, oral cavity, and hair. PC is characterized by hypertrophic nail dystrophy, plantar keratoderma, and mucosal lesions. 

### Function:

The KRT6C gene encodes a member of the type II cytokeratin family, which is an intermediate filament protein that helps to maintain the structural integrity of epithelial cells.

### External IDs and Aliases:

- HGNC: 6381
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 144568
- Ensembl: ENSG00000139219
- OMIM: 616290
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BYF1

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

There are several mutations in KRT6C associated with pachyonychia congenita, including:

- p.(Pro25Leu) - rs797045435
- p.(Arg141Gln) - rs75688092
- p.(Leu156Pro) - rs121908485

All of these mutations are missense mutations, which result in a single amino acid change in the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There are no reported somatic mutations in KRT6C.

### Related Disease:

Pachyonychia congenita (PC)

### Treatment and Prognosis:

There is currently no cure for pachyonychia congenita, but symptoms can be managed with treatments such as topical and oral medications, keratolytics, and surgery. The prognosis for individuals with PC varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

### Drug Response:

There are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of pachyonychia congenita, but several drugs have shown promise in clinical trials, including siRNA, small molecule inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway, and retinoids.
