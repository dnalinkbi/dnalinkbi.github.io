# **Information about Gene SETD2**

## **Genetic Position**
The SETD2 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3p21.31.

## **Pathology and Function**
The SETD2 (SET domain-containing protein 2) gene encodes a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3. This modification is important for maintaining genome integrity and regulating gene expression. Mutations in the SETD2 gene have been associated with various types of cancers, including kidney, lung, and breast cancer.
