## Information about Gene MEGF11

### Genetic Position
MEGF11 gene is located at chromosome 7q21.3.

### Pathology
MEGF11 gene is associated with neurologic disorders. Rare genetic variants in MEGF11 have been linked with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia.

### Function for gene
MEGF11 encodes a protein that has a role in synaptic function and plasticity, neuronal differentiation, and development.
