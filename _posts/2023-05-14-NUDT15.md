## Related Disease
- NUDT15 mutations have been associated with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression, which is a serious adverse reaction to thiopurine drugs used in the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Individuals with NUDT15 mutations are at an increased risk of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression if they are treated with thiopurine drugs. Therefore, physicians may consider alternative treatments or adjust the thiopurine drug dose in individuals with NUDT15 mutations.
- The prognosis for individuals with NUDT15 mutations depends on the severity of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression and the response to alternative treatments.

## Drug Response
- Thiopurine drugs that are used to treat leukemia and other malignancies may be less effective or more toxic in individuals with NUDT15 mutations.
