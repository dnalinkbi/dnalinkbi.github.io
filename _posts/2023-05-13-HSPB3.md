## Information about Gene HSPB3

### genetic position:

Gene HSPB3 is located on chromosome 5q23.2. It has a length of 3,977 base pairs and contains four exons.

### pathology:

Mutations in the HSPB3 gene have been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F), a neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. CMT2F is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and decreased reflexes.

### function:

The HSPB3 gene encodes a protein called heat shock protein beta-3 (HSPB3), also known as HSP27. HSPB3 is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, which are stress-induced molecular chaperones that protect cells from damage caused by heat, oxidative stress, and other environmental stresses. HSPB3 specifically helps to protect cells against oxidative stress, which is thought to be a contributing factor in the development of CMT2F.

### aliases and external IDs:

- Gene ID: 3310
- HGNC ID: 5214
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000145944
- OMIM ID: 608424
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P57308
- Aliases: CMT2F, HMN2B, HSP27, HSP28

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

Several missense mutations in the HSPB3 gene have been associated with CMT2F, including:

- p.Leu141Phe (rs201654591)
- p.Glu128Lys (rs201790666)
- p.Arg126Gln (rs201729967)
- p.Thr135Met (rs786205714)

All of these mutations are autosomal dominant and are located in the conserved alpha-crystallin domain of the protein.

### somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the HSPB3 gene.

### related disease:

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F)

### treatment and prognosis:

There is currently no known cure for CMT2F, and treatment is mainly focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic interventions may be helpful in maintaining mobility and quality of life for affected individuals.

### drug response:

There is currently no specific drug available for the treatment of CMT2F.
