## Gene SRSF2

- **Function:** The gene SRSF2 provides instructions for making a protein that belongs to the serine and arginine-rich splicing factor family. This protein is essential for the process of RNA splicing that converts the genetic instructions in DNA into functional proteins.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
   - HGNC: 11205
   - NCBI Entrez: 6426
   - Ensembl: ENSG00000136100
   - OMIM: 601818
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q07955
   - Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q25.1

- **Aliases:** SFRS2, SC35

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
   - There are various missense mutations identified in the SRSF2 gene that result in the replacement of single amino acids, such as:
      - P95H (rs61758367)
      - P95L (rs587776861)
      - P95R (rs587776862)
      - H84Q (rs767378983)
   - These mutations are somatic and are commonly found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
   - c.284C>T (rs61758716)
   - c.284C>G (rs587781513)
   - These SNVs are also somatic and found in MDS/AML.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the SRSF2 gene are associated with hematological malignancies such as MDS and AML.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The prognosis for MDS/AML patients with SRSF2 mutations is generally poor. Currently, there are no specific treatments available to target SRSF2 mutations.

- **Drug Response:** There is no known drug that targets SRSF2 mutations.
