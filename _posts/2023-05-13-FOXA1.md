# Information about gene FOXA1

## Genetic position
The FOXA1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q21.1).

## Pathology
Somatic mutations in FOXA1 have been found in various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and bladder cancers.

## Function
FOXA1 is a transcription factor that plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression in several tissues, including the liver, pancreas, lung, and mammary gland. In breast cancer, FOXA1 is involved in the regulation of estrogen receptor-mediated gene expression and is a key driver of luminal breast cancer subtype.

## Related diseases
FOXA1 mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast, prostate, and bladder cancers.

## Treatment and prognosis
FOXA1 has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment, particularly in luminal subtypes. FOXA1 expression has also been associated with a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients.

## Drug response
Various drugs targeting estrogen receptor signaling, such as tamoxifen, have been used to treat FOXA1-driven breast cancers.
