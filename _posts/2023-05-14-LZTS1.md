## Gene LZTS1

### Genetic Position
The gene LZTS1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 8, specifically on chromosome 8p22.

### Pathology
LZTS1 has been implicated in various types of cancer, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer. It is thought to function as a tumor suppressor gene.

### Function
LZTS1 encodes a protein that plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Specifically, it is involved in the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle.
