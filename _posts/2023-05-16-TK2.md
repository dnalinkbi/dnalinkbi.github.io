# Information about gene TK2

## Genomic location and aliases

- Gene: TK2 (thymidine kinase 2)
- Chromosome: 16
- Genomic location: chr16: 68,516,533-68,555,033 (GRCh38)
- Aliases: hTK2, MTDPS3

## Function of gene

Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is an enzyme that phosphorylates thymidine to form deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), which is an essential precursor for DNA synthesis in cells. TK2 is primarily expressed in mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and integrity.

## External IDs and sites

- HGNC: 11745
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 7084
- Ensembl: ENSG00000103197
- OMIM: 188250
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04147

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- G47S (rs28933391)
- W68G (rs28933392)
- R77C (rs28933393)
- Y87C (rs28933394)
- R109W (rs104894111)
- R130Q (rs28933395)

All of these mutations are missense mutations, which result in the change of a single amino acid in the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations in TK2 reported in the dbSNP database, including:

- C168T (rs532302777)
- A203G (rs796065477)
- G409A (rs2644461)
- C710T (rs56068343)

## Related diseases

Mutations in the TK2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including:

- Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)
- Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 2 (MTDPS2)
- Mitochondrial myopathy with myopathic mtDNA (MYOMTL)

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for mitochondrial disorders caused by TK2 mutations. Treatment is generally supportive and may involve managing symptoms, such as muscle weakness or respiratory problems.

## Drug response

There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of TK2-related mitochondrial disorders. However, some drugs, such as riboflavin and coenzyme Q10, have been suggested to potentially improve mitochondrial function in these patients.
