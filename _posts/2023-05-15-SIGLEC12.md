# Gene: SIGLEC12 

- **Function**: 
    - The SIGLEC12 gene encodes for a protein called sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 12 (Siglec-12).
    - Siglec-12 is a transmembrane receptor protein that is involved in cellular adhesion and immune responses.
    - It recognizes and binds to sialic acid residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids.
- **External IDs and Aliases**: 
    - HGNC: 18052 
    - NCBI Entrez: 89798 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000135636 
    - OMIM: 609674 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96LC7 
    - Aliases: SIGLEC-12, SiglecXII, CDw329
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - There are several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SIGLEC12 that result in amino acid changes. 
    - Some of these include: 
        - rs112645936: A>G substitution resulting in Lys>Glu change at position 190
        - rs1792815: C>G substitution resulting in Ala>Gly change at position 315
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: No known somatic SNVs/InDels in SIGLEC12 are present.
- **Related Disease**: 
    - Several studies have shown a potential association between SIGLEC12 and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
- **Treatment and Prognosis**:
    - As of now, there is no specific treatment for disorders associated with SIGLEC12 mutations.
    - The prognosis for individuals with SIGLEC12 mutations may vary depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms. 
- **Drug Response**:
    - No drug response information is available so far.
