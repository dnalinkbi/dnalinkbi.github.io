# Gene information for DIAPH2

## Genetic position
DIAPH2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31.3). This gene spans 147,031 base pairs and contains 30 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in this gene have been associated with several diseases including premature ovarian failure and primary ovarian insufficiency.

## Function
DIAPH2 encodes for a protein known as diaphanous-related formin 2 (DRF2). This protein is involved in actin filament assembly and regulation of cell motility.

Some somatic SNVs/InDels in DIAPH2 include:
- rs746842014
- rs35482568
- rs202008950

## Related disease
DIAPH2 mutations have been associated with several diseases including:
- Premature ovarian failure (POF)
- Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)

## Treatment and prognosis
There are currently no known cures for conditions related to DIAPH2 mutations. Treatment options may include hormone replacement therapy or other medications to manage symptoms. The prognosis may vary depending on the specific diagnosis and severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
There is limited research on DIAPH2-specific drug responses. More research is needed to better understand potential drug targets for this gene.
