# Gene SPTBN2

**Genetic Position and Genomic Information**
- SPTBN2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.4).
- Genomic coordinates: start 71,983,221 bp and end 72,089,253 bp (GRCh38).
- Aliases: b-III spectrin, beta-III spectrin, SPTBN4.

**Function**
- SPTBN2 encodes for beta-III spectrin protein, which is mainly expressed in the central nervous system.
- The protein is involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and membrane stability of neuronal cells.
- It is also implicated in the spatial arrangement and regulation of glutamate receptors and ion channels at the postsynaptic membrane.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID**
- Several disease-causing missense mutations have been documented in the SPTBN2 gene.
- p.Arg2626His (rs886042511) and p.Asn2767Lys (rs887205774) are two reported missense mutations causing early-onset spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder.
- Another missense mutation, p.Asp2887Asn (rs201395277), has been associated with essential tremor, a common movement disorder characterized by rhythmic shaking of hands, head, and voice.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the SPTBN2 gene.

**Related Diseases**
- SCA5: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor coordination and balance, resulting in severe disability.
- Essential Tremor: A movement disorder characterized by unintentional rhythmic shaking of the hands, head, and voice.

**Treatment and Prognosis**
- There are no specific treatments available for SCA5 or essential tremor, but several medications can help alleviate some symptoms.
- The prognosis for SCA5 and essential tremor varies depending on the severity and progression of symptoms.

**Drug Response**
- No information is available regarding drug response in relation to SPTBN2 gene mutations.
