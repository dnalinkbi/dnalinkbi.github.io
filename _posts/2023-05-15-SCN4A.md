## Information about gene SCN4A

### Genetic position
Gene SCN4A is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 23.3.

### Pathology
SCN4A gene mutations are associated with several neuromuscular disorders such as Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HypoPP), Paramyotonia Congenita (PMC), and Myotonia Congenita (MC).

### Function for gene
SCN4A gene encodes for a sodium channel protein that is responsible for nerve impulses and muscle contraction.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported.

### Related disease
SCN4A gene mutations are associated with Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HypoPP), Paramyotonia Congenita (PMC), and Myotonia Congenita (MC).

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for these disorders largely involves treating the symptoms of the disease and keeping the potassium levels in check.

The prognosis of the diseases is usually good and patients can live a normal life if the symptoms are managed properly.

### Drug response
The use of mexiletine has been successful in the treatment of muscle stiffness associated with these disorders.
