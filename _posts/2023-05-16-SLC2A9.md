# Information about Gene SLC2A9

## Overview

SLC2A9 is a gene that encodes for a protein called glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9). GLUT9 is found in the kidney and plays a role in regulating uric acid levels in the body.

## Function for Gene

SLC2A9 plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of urate by the kidney. It helps transport uric acid from the blood into the kidneys, where it is filtered and eventually excreted in the urine.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for SLC2A9 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease

Mutations in SLC2A9 have been linked to several health conditions, including:

- Gout
- Hyperuricemia
- Cardiovascular disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment for gout and hyperuricemia typically involves the use of medication to lower uric acid levels in the blood. Prognosis for individuals with these conditions varies based on severity and response to treatment.

## Drug Response

Several medications have been developed to manage gout and hyperuricemia, including:

- Allopurinol
- Febuxostat
- Probenecid

Response to these medications may vary based on the individual's genetic background and specific SLC2A9 mutations.
