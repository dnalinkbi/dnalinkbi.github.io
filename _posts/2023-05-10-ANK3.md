### Gene: ANK3

#### Function:
The ANK3 gene encodes the ankyrin-G protein, which is involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and ion channels in neurons. It plays a role in the stability and maintenance of the axon initial segment, a specialized region of the neuron that controls the initiation of action potentials.

#### External IDs and Genomic Location:
- HGNC ID: 537
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 288
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000154122
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10q21.2
- Aliases: ANK2, ANK3L, ANKYR2

#### AA Mutation List:
- p.Arg823Gln (rs149494487): missense mutation, rsid in dbSNP
- p.Pro789Leu (rs149487927): missense mutation, rsid in dbSNP
- p.Ala1599Gly (rs757617283): missense mutation, rsid in dbSNP
- p.His1932Gln (rs767741781): missense mutation, rsid in dbSNP

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the ANK3 gene in the dbSNP database.

#### Related Disease:
The ANK3 gene has been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Variants in the gene have also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability.

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
There are currently no specific treatments for mutations in the ANK3 gene. Treatment options are generally focused on managing symptoms associated with the related neuropsychiatric disorders.

#### Drug Response:
There is currently no information available on drug response specifically related to mutations in the ANK3 gene.
