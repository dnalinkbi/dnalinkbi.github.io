# Genetic Information Analysis Report

## Gene: NAT8L

N-acetyltransferase 8-like (NAT8L) is a gene that codes for a protein involved in acetylation reactions. Recent studies have suggested that NAT8L can regulate energy metabolism and may be involved in the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.

### Function

The NAT8L gene encodes a protein that functions as an N-acetyltransferase, transferring an acetyl group to various substrates. It has been shown to acetylate a range of molecules, including arylamines, heterocyclic amines, and acetyl-CoA. While the exact function of NAT8L is still not fully understood, recent studies have suggested that it may play a role in regulating energy metabolism.

### External IDs and Genomic Location

- HGNC ID: HGNC:25483
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 122830
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000196092
- OMIM ID: 609080
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6P1M3

NAT8L is located on the q arm of chromosome 2 (2q14.1).

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID

There are several reported mutations in the NAT8L gene. Some of these include:

- rs146789904 (p.Arg256Trp)
- rs146337142 (p.Ser90Ile)
- rs142220458 (p.Phe206Cys)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels with dbSNP ID in NAT8L gene.

### Related Disease

Recent studies have suggested that NAT8L may be involved in the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, there is some evidence that mutations in the gene may be linked to increased risk for bladder cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for NAT8L-related disorders. Management of symptoms typically involves lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, as well as medication to control related conditions.

### Drug Response

Currently, there are no known drugs that target NAT8L for the treatment of related conditions.
