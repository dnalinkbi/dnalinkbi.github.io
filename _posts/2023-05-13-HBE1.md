# Gene Information Analysis: Gene HBE1

## General Information
- **Function for gene:** The HBE1 gene codes for the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin which is an important component of red blood cells. This gene is involved in the transport of oxygen to different parts of the body.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

| Gene Name | HGNC | NCBI Entrez | Ensembl Gene ID | Genomic Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HBE1 | HGNC:4828 | Entrez Gene: 3047 | ENSG00000244769 | Chr. 11: 5,150,556 - 5,151,374 |

**Aliases:** Beta-globin chain, Hemoglobin beta-1 chain

## Genetic Variations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

    There are several known mutations in the HBE1 gene. Here are a few examples:

    | Mutation Name | AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | HBB:c.93-2A>G | N/A | Splice site | rs334 |
    | HBB:c.20A>T | p.Lys7Asn | Missense | rs334 |
    | HBB:c.92G>C | p.Glu31Gln | Missense | rs33950507 |
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

    No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for the HBE1 gene.


## Related Diseases
- Mutations in the HBE1 gene can cause various autosomal recessive disorders such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. These are blood disorders that affect the production or function of hemoglobin.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**

    Treatment options for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia include blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for individuals with these disorders can vary depending on the severity of the disease.
    

## Drug Response
- Individuals with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia may require lifelong medical management, which may include the use of medications. Hydroxyurea is a medication that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of sickle cell anemia.
