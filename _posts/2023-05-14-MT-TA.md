## Information about Gene MT-TA

### Genetic Position
* Gene Name: MT-TA 
* Chromosome: Mitochondrial DNA
* Location:  m.5736A>G

### Function
* MT-TA gene encodes transfer RNA (tRNA) which helps in protein synthesis within mitochondria. 

### External IDs
* HGNC ID: 7491
* NCBI Entrez ID: 4577
* Ensembl ID: ENSG00000206509
* OMIM ID: 590085
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: 

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
* There are no reported amino acid mutations associated with MT-TA gene

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
* There are no reported somatic SNPs/InDels associated with MT-TA gene

### Related Disease
* The m.5736A>G variant in MT-TA gene can lead to mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
* Currently, there is no cure for MELAS syndrome and treatment mainly focuses on relieving the symptoms. Prognosis is generally poor with a shortened lifespan. 

### Drug Response
* There is no specific drug treatment available to treat the underlying cause of MELAS.
