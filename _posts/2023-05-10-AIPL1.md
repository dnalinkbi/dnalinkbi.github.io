## Gene: AIPL1

**Function:**
AIPL1 (araucan-inducible protein) gene encodes for a protein that is involved in the development and functioning of the retina. It plays an essential role in the early onset of retinal dystrophy.

**External IDs:**

- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 23746
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000132692
- OMIM ID: 604392
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NZN9

**Aliases:**
- ARA
- ARAIP
- hCAR
- RP17

**AA Mutation List:**

| Mutation Type | AA Change | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missense | R642W | rs80356762 |
| Missense | R791W | rs137853690 |

| Frameshift | c.506_507insA | rs782654512 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
No information available on somatic mutations in AIPL1

**Related Disease:**
- **Leber congenital amaurosis 4 (LCA4)**: AIPL1 mutations are associated with autosomal recessive LCA, which is a severe retinal dystrophy characterized by severe visual impairment and rapid loss of photoreceptor cells.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
There is currently no cure for LCA4, and treatment is mainly supportive and focused on improving the quality of life of patients. Several ongoing clinical trials are investigating gene therapy approaches for the treatment of LCA4.

**Drug Response:**
No specific drug has been approved for the treatment of LCA4, but some drugs have shown promise in pre-clinical studies.
