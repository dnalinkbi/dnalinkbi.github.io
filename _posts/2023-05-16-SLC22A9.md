## Information about Gene SLC22A9

### Genetic Position
The gene SLC22A9 is located on chromosome 5 at the position 5q31.1.

### Pathology
The SLC22A9 gene is associated with various diseases including gout, hypertension, and renal impairment. In some studies, it has been found that variants in this gene are linked to increased serum urate levels and gout risk.

### Function
The SLC22A9 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the transport of organic anions and cations across cell membranes. The protein plays a role in the excretion of uric acid from the body by transporting it from the blood into the urine.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several variants associated with the SLC22A9 gene. Some of the common variants include:
- rs12429692: Arg325Trp
- rs2269524: Ala463Thr
- rs2728124: Gly465Ser
- rs2291799: Leu38Pro
- rs2078267: Ile113Thr

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs or InDels associated with the SLC22A9 gene.

### Related Disease
Variants in the SLC22A9 gene have been associated with various diseases, including:
- Gout
- Hypertension
- Renal Impairment

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for gout, but the symptoms can be managed with medication. In some cases, lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and exercise can help to reduce the risk of developing gout. For hypertension and renal impairment, treatment usually involves medication to manage blood pressure and to reduce the risk of complications.

### Drug Response
Variants in the SLC22A9 gene have been linked to differences in drug response, particularly for drugs that are excreted through the kidneys. For example, in some studies, variants in this gene have been associated with differences in response to the drug probenecid, which is used to treat gout.
