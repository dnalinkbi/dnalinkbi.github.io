## Gene: CDH13

### Information about Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function:

- Genetic position: Chromosome 16q23.3

- Pathology: Variants in CDH13 have been associated with various diseases such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), and substance use disorders.

- Function for gene: CDH13 encodes a protein called T-cadherin, which is involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. T-cadherin has been implicated in many biological processes such as angiogenesis, cell migration, and tumorigenesis.
