## Information about gene COL6A1

### Genetic Position
The gene COL6A1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 at position 22.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the COL6A1 gene are associated with various muscular dystrophies, including Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy.

### Function
COL6A1 encodes for collagen type VI alpha 1 chain, which is a major structural component of extracellular matrix that provides tensile strength to connective tissues such as muscle and skin. The protein helps in cell adhesion and regulates cell behavior.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- The missense mutation, c.1480G>A in exon 15 of COL6A1 gene causes glycine substitution with aspartic acid at amino acid position 494 (p.Gly494Asp), rs3729948.
- The mutation, c.632C>T in exon 6 of COL6A1 gene results in the substitution of arginine with tryptophan at codon 211 (p.Arg211Trp), rs11559024.
- The nonsense mutation, c.913C>T in exon 9 of COL6A1 gene causes the change of glutamine to a stop codon at amino acid 305 (p.Gln305*), rs36242539.
- The frameshift mutation, c.492dupA in exon 4 of COL6A1 gene generates a premature termination codon, rs121918245

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the COL6A1 gene reported in various cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Some of the SNVs and InDels with their dbSNP ID are listed below:
- c.3054-293C>T, rs1559839879
- c.3071G>A, rs1559848188
- c.2659-103T>C, rs372282841
- c.3579delC, rs1559841290

### Related Diseases
Mutations in COL6A1 gene are associated with several muscular dystrophies, including:

- Bethlem myopathy
- Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy
- Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
- Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome
- Late-Onset Distal Myopathy With Rimmed Vacuoles

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the COL6A1 gene. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Physical therapy, respiratory support, and surgery may be helpful.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug available for the treatment of mutations in the COL6A1 gene. However, supportive therapies and corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms.
