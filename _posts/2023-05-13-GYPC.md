# Gene: GYPC

## Genetic Position
The GYPC gene is located at chromosome 2q14.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GYPC gene can lead to Gerbich blood group system antigens deficiency. This blood group system is a collection of red blood cell surface antigens and variations in the GYPC gene can result in altered expression or complete absence of these antigens, causing hemolytic disease in newborns or transfusion reactions.

## Function
The GYPC gene encodes for the glycophorin C protein, which is a component of the red blood cell membrane. It helps to maintain the structural integrity of the red blood cell membrane and plays a role in cell adhesion.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the GYPC gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations or deficiencies in the GYPC gene can lead to Gerbich blood group system antigens deficiency, which can cause hemolytic disease in newborns or transfusion reactions.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for Gerbich blood group system antigens deficiency. However, blood typing and cross-matching can prevent hemolytic disease in newborns or transfusion reactions.

## Drug Response
No relevant drug response has been reported for the GYPC gene.
