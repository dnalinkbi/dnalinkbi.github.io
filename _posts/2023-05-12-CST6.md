## Function

CST6 (Cystatin E/M) is a member of the cystatin superfamily, which plays an essential role in regulating protease activity. CST6 inhibits cathepsin B, a cysteine protease required for extracellular matrix degradation and invasion in tumor cells. It is also involved in several processes, including angiogenesis, bone resorption, and neurodegeneration.

## Genetic Variations

- AA Mutation List: CST6 contains 141 amino acids.
- Mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    - rs2071593: p.Ile50Val
    - rs2071592: p.Gln29His
    - rs2071591: p.Ala25Val

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

None reported

## Related Diseases

Studies have found the aberrant expression of CST6 gene in several diseases, such as breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment available for CST6-mediated diseases. However, CST6 gene therapy using adenovirus vectors showed significant inhibition of tumor growth in lung cancer cells. 

## Drug Response

None reported
