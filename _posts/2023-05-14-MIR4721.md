## Gene MIR4721

**Genetic Position**

MIR4721 is a microRNA gene located on chromosome 14q32.31.

**Pathology**

MIR4721 has been suggested to play a role in the development of lung cancer, as it is frequently overexpressed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues.

**Function for Gene**

MIR4721 is a microRNA, a small non-coding RNA molecule that regulates the expression of other genes. Its specific function is not fully understood, but it has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and development.

**External IDs and Aliases**

- HGNC ID: HGNC:44634
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 100128758
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000220373
- OMIM ID: n/a
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: n/a
- Aliases: MIRN4721, hsa-mir-4721

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**

As MIR4721 is a microRNA gene, there are no amino acid (AA) mutations associated with it.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

There are currently no somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or insertions/deletions (InDels) associated with MIR4721 in the dbSNP database.

**Related Disease**

MIR4721 has been suggested to play a role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development, but further research is needed to fully understand its relationship to the disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis**

As understanding of the role of MIR4721 in disease is currently limited, there are no known treatments or prognoses associated with it.

**Drug Response**

There is no current knowledge of drug response specifically related to MIR4721.
