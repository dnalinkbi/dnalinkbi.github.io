# Information about gene PPARGC1B

## Genetic Position

The gene PPARGC1B is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 and spans over 73 kb on the genomic position 5q31.1.

## Pathology and Function

The PPARGC1B gene encodes a protein called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-beta (PGC1-beta), which is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates various biological processes including energy metabolism, thermogenesis, and muscle differentiation. PPARGC1B is highly expressed in metabolic tissues such as brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and has been implicated in various metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several reported somatic variants in the PPARGC1B gene. Some of them are:

| Variant Type | dbSNP ID |
|--------------|----------|
| SNV          | rs144672497|
| SNV          | rs368285852|

## Related Disease

PPARGC1B mutations or dysregulation have been associated with several metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is not yet a specific treatment targeted at PPARGC1B itself. However, controlling several metabolic diseases such as necessary lifestyle modifications and medication may help to regulate the expression of PPARGC1B pathway and reduce the risk of developing metabolic disorders.

## Drug Response

PPARGC1B has been linked to drug resistance in some cancers. Moreover, drugs that activate PGC-1β have been investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders.
