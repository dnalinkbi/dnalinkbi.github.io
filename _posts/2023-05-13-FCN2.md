## Gene FCN2

### Genetic Position and Pathology
FCN2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q34.11). This gene encodes for the protein ficolin-2. Ficolin-2 plays an important role in the innate immune system to recognize and bind to different carbohydrate patterns on pathogens. Mutations in FCN2 gene have been associated with several diseases such as infectious and autoimmune diseases.

### Function
FCN2 gene codes for ficolin-2 or L-ficolin, which is a member of the ficolin family of proteins. Ficolins play an important role in innate immunity by activating the complement system through lectin pathway. Ficolin-2 is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood. It binds to carbohydrates on pathogens and initiates the complement cascade leading to death of the pathogen.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in FCN2 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in FCN2 gene have been associated with various infectious and autoimmune diseases such as recurrent respiratory infections, pneumonia, tuberculosis, meningitis, sepsis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for FCN2-associated diseases. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and controlling the underlying infection or autoimmune disease. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the underlying disease and the presence of co-morbidities.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets FCN2 gene. However, some drugs that are used for the treatment of infectious and autoimmune diseases may indirectly affect the complement system and the function of ficolin-2.
