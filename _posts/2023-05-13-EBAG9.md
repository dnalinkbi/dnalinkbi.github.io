## Information about Gene EBAG9

Gene Name: EBAG9 (Estrogen Receptor Binding Site Associated)     

### Function for Gene
The EBAG9 gene encodes a protein called estrogen receptor-binding fragment-associated antigen 9, which is involved in immune system regulation and has also been suggested to have a role in cancer development.

### External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 3135
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 9166
- Ensembl: ENSG00000193734
- OMIM: 602010
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00586

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are 204 missense mutations listed for the EBAG9 gene in the dbSNP database, with rsIDs ranging from rs770002041 to rs769191407.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic mutations listed for EBAG9 in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease
Several studies have suggested a potential association between EBAG9 expression and a range of cancer types, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments targeting EBAG9, but its expression levels may be useful as a biomarker for predicting prognosis or response to therapy in certain cancers.

### Drug Response
There is no current evidence to suggest that EBAG9 expression levels may influence response to specific drugs.
