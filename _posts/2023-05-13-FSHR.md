# Information about gene FSHR

### Genetic Position
- The FSHR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2p16.3).

### Pathology
- Mutations in the FSHR gene have been associated with female infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

### Function
- The FSHR gene encodes the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), which is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a key role in the reproductive system.
- FSHR is primarily expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovary, where it plays a critical role in folliculogenesis, the process by which immature ovarian follicles develop into mature follicles capable of ovulation.
- FSHR also plays a role in testicular function, as it is expressed in Sertoli and Leydig cells and is involved in spermatogenesis.

- HGNC: 4030
- NCBI Entrez: 2492
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169252
- OMIM: 136435
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23945
- Aliases: LGR1, ODG1, FSH-R, FSHR1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- The FSHR gene has many known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region, some of which are associated with altered receptor function. Some examples of these SNPs include:
    - p.Asn680Ser (rs6165)
    - p.Ser680Asn (rs6166)
    - p.Thr307Ala (rs6169)
    - p.Thr307Ser (rs2274910)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations in the FSHR gene have not been widely reported or studied.

### Related Disease
- Mutations in the FSHR gene have been linked to female infertility and PCOS.
- Polymorphisms in the FSHR gene have also been associated with ovarian cancer risk.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for female infertility and PCOS depends on the individual case but may include ovulation induction therapies, weight loss, and lifestyle modifications.
- Prognosis for infertility and PCOS can vary depending on the severity of the condition and other factors such as age and overall health.

### Drug Response
- Some studies have suggested that certain FSHR polymorphisms may influence response to ovulation-inducing drugs such as clomiphene.
