# Gene Information for TMPRSS2

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 21
- Genomic coordinates: 49215334 - 49248601 [GRCh38/hg38]

## Pathology

TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane protease serine 2) is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and COVID-19. The gene is upregulated in prostate cancer, leading to the activation of androgen receptor signaling and cancer progression.

## Function

TMPRSS2 encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease that plays a key role in the cleavage and activation of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The protein is also involved in the processing of other viral and cellular proteins, including the fusion protein of the respiratory syncytial virus.

- c.745A>G [rs12329760]
- c.341T>C [rs769242155]
- c.1085C>T [rs139238522]
- c.1095G>C [rs139238523]

## Related Disease

TMPRSS2 is associated with several diseases, including:

- Prostate cancer
- Breast cancer
- COVID-19

## Treatment and Prognosis

The inhibition of TMPRSS2 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 and prostate cancer. Several drugs, including camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, have been identified as TMPRSS2 inhibitors.

## Drug Response

The response to TMPRSS2 inhibitors varies depending on the disease. In COVID-19, camostat mesylate is believed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by blocking the cleavage of the viral spike protein. In prostate cancer, the inhibition of TMPRSS2 may reduce cancer cell proliferation and progression.
