# Gene Information on PNPLA6

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**PNPLA6** (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6) is a gene located on human chromosome 19p13.2. Studies have found a link between mutations in this gene and the development of neurological diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), Boucher-Neuh채user syndrome (BNS), and Gordon Holmes syndrome (GHS). PNPLA6 codes for a member of the family of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins, which are involved in lipid metabolism. 

## Function for Gene

PNPLA6 has multiple functions, including:

- **Lipid metabolism:** PNPLA6 is involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides, which are circulating lipids in the blood.
- **Membrane trafficking:** PNPLA6 is required for the correct distribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) markers and the maintenance of ERGIC structure and function.
- **Neurological development:** PNPLA6 is involved in the proper formation and maintenance of neuronal connections.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location

- **HGNC ID:** 9287
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 10908
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000125785
- **OMIM ID:** 603197
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q8N4B1

Aliases for PNPLA6 include neuropathy target esterase (NTE), patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 7 (PNPLA7), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 6 (DGAT6).

PNPLA6 is located on human chromosome 19 at position 13.2.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

**dbSNP IDs** are provided where available.

- **p.Thr1166Ser** (rs137852675): This missense mutation occurs in the PNPLA6 gene and can cause hereditary spastic paraplegia. 
- **p.Ala1231Pro** (rs774772646): This missense mutation occurs in the PNPLA6 gene and can cause a form of Boucher-Neuh채user syndrome.
- **p.Glu1431Lys** (rs398124464): This missense mutation occurs in the PNPLA6 gene and can cause a form of Gordon Holmes syndrome.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the PNPLA6 gene in dbSNP.

## Related disease

Mutations in the PNPLA6 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including:

- **Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP):** Common symptoms include progressive weakness and spasticity in the legs, leading to difficulty walking.
- **Boucher-Neuh채user syndrome (BNS):** This rare disorder is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, hypogonadism, and chorioretinal dystrophy.
- **Gordon Holmes syndrome (GHS):** This rare disorder is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and hypogonadism.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for PNPLA6-associated neurological disorders, and treatments are focused on managing symptoms. Physical therapy and mobility aids may be helpful in managing symptoms of hereditary spastic paraplegia. BNS and GHS are managed through symptomatic treatment of their specific symptoms.

## Drug response

There is currently no known drug response for PNPLA6-associated neurological disorders.
