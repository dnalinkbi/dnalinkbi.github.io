# Analysis of Gene KCNIP4

## Genetic Position
KCNIP4 gene is located on chromosome 4 at the position 4p15.31.

## Pathology and Function
KCNIP4 gene encodes for a protein called potassium channel-interacting protein 4, which is involved in modulating the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels. Studies have suggested that this protein plays a role in the regulation of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation.
