## Information about Gene SBF2

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- The SBF2 gene is located at position 11p15.1 on chromosome 11.
- Mutations in the SBF2 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is a type of inherited peripheral neuropathy that affects the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
- The SBF2 gene is responsible for encoding the protein called the Set-binding factor 2 (SBF2). This protein plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the peripheral nerves.

### Function for Gene
The SBF2 gene provides instructions for creating a protein called SBF2. This protein plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of peripheral nerves by regulating the formation and stability of axons.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are various types of mutations found in the SBF2 gene associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Some of them are:

| Mutation Type | Amino Acid Change | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missense | p.Arg1206Gln | rs121908171 |
| Missense | p.Ala429Thr | rs267607273 |
| Missense | p.Leu1098Pro | rs398122188 |
| Missense | p.Arg557His | rs267607235 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Not Applicable. Somatic mutations are not associated with the SBF2 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the SBF2 gene are associated with an autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3 (CMT4B3). This disease affects the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sensory disturbances.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, including CMT4B3. However, treatment can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with the SBF2 gene.
