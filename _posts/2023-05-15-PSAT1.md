# Information about Gene PSAT1

## Genetic Position
The gene PSAT1 is located on the chromosome 9q21.33.

## Pathology and Function
PSAT1 gene encodes for phosphoserine aminotransferase, which is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid L-serine. It plays a critical role in serine and one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for cell growth and proliferation. 
Mutations in the PSAT1 gene have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency. This disorder causes developmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures.

## Function for Gene
The function of the PSAT1 gene is to catalyze the conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to L-phosphoserine, which is then converted to L-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase.
