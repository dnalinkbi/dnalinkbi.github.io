# Gene: CASP3
## Genetic Position
CASP3 gene is located on chromosome 4q35.1.

## Pathology
CASP3 gene is associated with various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. Mutations in this gene have been associated with developmental disorders such as neural tube defects.

## Function
CASP3 gene encodes caspase-3 protein which plays an important role in apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease that cleaves a variety of cellular proteins during apoptosis which leads to cell death.
