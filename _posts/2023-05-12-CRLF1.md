## Information on Gene CRLF1 

### Genetic Position and Alias

- **Gene Name**: CRLF1
- **Chromosome**: X
- **Location**: Xp22.11
- **Alias**: CLF, CLF1, CRLF

### Function

CRLF1 encodes a cytokine receptor-like factor that specifically binds to the Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) receptor and mediates its downstream signaling. It has been shown to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of neurons and oligodendrocytes. 

### External IDs and Genomic Location

- **HGNC ID**: 2328
- **NCBI Entrez ID**: 9244
- **Ensembl ID**: ENSG00000155657
- **OMIM ID**: 604237
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID**: Q99683
- **Genomic Location**: NC_000023.10 (8439514..8450363, complement)

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in CRLF1 gene. Some of the missense SNPs and their corresponding amino acid changes are:

| dbSNP ID | SNP Type | Amino Acid Change |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic mutations have been reported yet for CRLF1 gene. 

### Related Disease

CRLF1 mutations have been associated with human diseases such as Crisponi/Cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS) and Mutated atypical features syndrome (MARS). These conditions are characterized by various physical abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological defects.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There are no specific treatments available for CRLF1-related genetic disorders. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive, aiming to manage the various symptoms associated with the disorders. However, early diagnosis and appropriate management can improve the prognosis of affected individuals. 

### Drug Response

No specific drugs have been developed for CRLF1-related disorders. However, some symptomatic treatments may include medications to manage seizures, pain, and muscle stiffness.
