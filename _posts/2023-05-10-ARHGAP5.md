## Gene: ARHGAP5

### Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 14
- Location: q11.2
- Strand: -
- GRCh38.p13 Reference Assembly

### Pathology and Function

ARHGAP5 gene encodes a member of the Rho GTPase-activating protein family. The protein encoded by this gene is thought to be a negative regulator of RhoA, which regulates cell motility and morphology. It has a pivotal role in oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. There is growing evidence that ARHGAP5 acts as a tumor suppressor gene.
