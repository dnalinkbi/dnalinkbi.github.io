## Gene CCDC8

- **Function:** The coiled-coil domain-containing protein 8 (CCDC8) is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and functions as a tumor suppressor. It has been shown to interact with other proteins involved in cell growth and division, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and retinoblastoma protein.

- **Related disease:** CCDC8 mutations have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory infections due to impaired motility of cilia.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications, such as respiratory infections. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the frequency and severity of infections.

- **Drug response:** There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in CCDC8.
