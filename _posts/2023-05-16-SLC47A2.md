# Gene SLC47A2 Information

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 12 (12q24.31)

**Pathology:** Mutations in SLC47A2 have been associated with altered drug response and increased risk of drug toxicity.

**Function for Gene:** SLC47A2 encodes a protein that functions as a transporter and is involved in the uptake and elimination of various drugs and toxins in the body.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 29184
- NCBI Entrez: 284444
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163425
- OMIM: 614952
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6NUS2

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Val408Met (rs2289669)
- p.Val449Ile (rs2289668)
- p.Arg61His (rs150540117)
- p.Leu498Phe (rs55918055)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.1366G>A (rs138797710)
- c.448T>G (rs191237076)
- c.1396C>T (rs191237075)

**Related Diseases:**
- Reduced drug response to Metformin and other biguanides
- Increased risk of drug toxicity (e.g., Methotrexate, Chloroquine)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options may include adjusting drug dosages based on genetic testing results to reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions. Prognosis depends on the specific genetic variant and associated drug response.

**Drug Response:** Genetic variants in SLC47A2 can affect drug response, with some mutations leading to reduced drug efficacy and others increasing the risk of drug toxicity.
