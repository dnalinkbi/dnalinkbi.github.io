## Gene: RPS14
### Genetic Position:
RPS14 is located on chromosome 5q33.1.

### Pathology:
Loss of function mutations in RPS14 have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare congenital disorder characterized by impaired erythropoiesis.

### Function:
RPS14 encodes for a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S ribosome subunit. RPS14 is involved in the binding of mRNA to ribosomes to initiate protein translation.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 10497
- NCBI Entrez: 6204
- Ensembl: ENSG00000113620
- OMIM: 603701
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P62249

### AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- C18S (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs387906797
- C93G (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs756633833

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.386-10_386-9insC (splice site mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs755270983
- c.510C>T (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs782794153

### Related Disease:
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment for DBA typically involves blood transfusions and corticosteroids. Prognosis may depend on the severity of anemia and other medical conditions associated with DBA.

### Drug Response:
Some studies have suggested that corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs may be effective in treating DBA. However, individual drug response may vary.
