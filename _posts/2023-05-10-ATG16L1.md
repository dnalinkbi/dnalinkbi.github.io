# Gene: ATG16L1

## Genetic Position
ATG16L1 is located on chromosome 2 at position 39,903,425 to 39,975,101 (GRCh38/hg38).

## Pathology and Function
ATG16L1 is an autophagy-related gene that is involved in the formation of autophagosomes. It plays a crucial role in the process of autophagy, which is important for clearing intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles. ATG16L1 is also involved in regulating the innate immune response to invading pathogens. Mutations in the ATG16L1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation of the digestive tract.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the ATG16L1 gene.

## Related Disease
- Crohn's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Crohn's disease, but treatments are available that can help manage symptoms and reduce inflammation. These include anti-inflammatory medications, immunosuppressive drugs, and antibiotics. The prognosis for Crohn's disease varies depending on the severity of the disease and individual response to treatment.

## Drug Response
Polymorphisms in the ATG16L1 gene have been associated with a reduced response to the anti-TNF drug, infliximab, which is used to treat Crohn's disease.
