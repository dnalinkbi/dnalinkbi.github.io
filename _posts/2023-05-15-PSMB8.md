# Information on Gene PSMB8

### Gene Position
The PSMB8 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.32) and spans a length of about 7.7 kilobases.

### Pathology
The PSMB8 gene encodes the proteasome subunit beta type-8, which is a member of the proteasome complex and plays an important role in protein degradation. Mutations in the PSMB8 gene are associated with a range of immune-mediated diseases, including a rare autosomal recessive disorder called chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome.

### Function
The protein encoded by the PSMB8 gene is a key component of the 20S proteasome, which is responsible for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins in the cytoplasm of cells. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating a wide range of cellular processes, including DNA repair, apoptosis, and immune response.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the PSMB8 gene are associated with several immune-mediated diseases, including:
- Chronic Atypical Neutrophilic Dermatosis with Lipodystrophy and Elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome
- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CANDLE syndrome, but treatment is possible through the use of immunomodulatory drugs such as glucocorticoids, tocilizumab, and anakinra. The severity of the disease varies among individuals, but it typically results in systemic inflammation, muscle weakness, and lipodystrophy, which can impact an individual's lifespan and quality of life.

### Drug Response
Individuals with mutations in the PSMB8 gene may be more or less responsive to certain drugs, depending on the nature of the mutation and the individual's genetic makeup. For example, some individuals with CANDLE syndrome may respond well to tocilizumab, while others may not.
