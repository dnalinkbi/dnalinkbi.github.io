# Gene ERC1

## General Information
- **Function for gene**: ERC1 (ELKS/Rab6-interacting/CAST family member 1) encodes a cytoskeletal protein involved in neurotransmitter release and synaptic organization.
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 12, band q21.33.
- **Aliases**: CAST1, ELKS, ERC-1, KIAA0531.

## External IDs and links
- **HGNC ID**: HGNC:3785
- **NCBI Entrez**: 10462
- **Ensembl ID**: ENSG00000135476
- **OMIM ID**: 606355
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID**: O95295

## Genetic Mutations
- **AA mutation list**: There are several AA mutations reported in ERC1 that are associated with different diseases and disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some of the common mutations are:
  - A366T, I856T, R1581W, E1912Q, I2133T, and R2147Q.
- **Mutation type**: Missense mutations
- **dbSNP ID**: rs150216345, rs769073994, rs374449117, rs764698223, rs797046740

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No significant somatic mutations have been reported in ERC1 with dbSNP ID.

## Related Diseases
- **Parkinson's Disease**: SNPs and different AA mutations in ERC1 have been associated with the susceptibility of Parkinson's disease risk.
- **Autism Spectrum Disorder**: ERC1 has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), where mutations in ERC1 gene have been found in ASD patients.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no specific treatment available for disorders associated with ERC1 mutations. The prognosis largely depends on the type and severity of the disease/disorder that the patient is affected with.
 
## Drug Response
- No drugs have been identified to have a specific response on ERC1-associated disorders.
