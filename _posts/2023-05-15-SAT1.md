# Gene SAT1

## Information
- **Pathology**: Gene SAT1 is located on chromosome 3p13-p12 and its mutations are associated with lysinuric protein intolerance, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by hyperammonemia, polyuria, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, osteoporosis, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
- **Function**: SAT1 encodes for a bifunctional enzyme (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase) that catalyzes the acetylation of polyamines which control diverse cellular functions. Studies show that SAT1 is involved in various physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
- **External IDs**: SAT1 is also known as STQTL1, SSAT, and Spermidine/spermine N 1-acetyltransferase 1. Its genomic location is 3p13-p12. It can be accessed via HGNC (11708), NCBI Entrez (6308), Ensembl (ENSG00000264668), OMIM (601948), and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (P21673).

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: SAT1 has multiple single nucleotide variations and insertion/deletions that have been reported in the literature. One example is the missense variant p.Asp140Glu (rs1805375), which has been associated with lysinuric protein intolerance.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: No somatic mutations of SAT1 have been reported in the literature.
- **Related disease**: As mentioned above, mutations in SAT1 are associated with lysinuric protein intolerance.
- **Treatment and prognosis**: Currently, the standard treatment for lysinuric protein intolerance includes a low-protein diet and administration of L-ornithine-L-aspartate. The prognosis for patients with this disease is variable, but early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve their quality of life.
- **Drug response**: Some studies have shown that arginine administration can exacerbate symptoms in patients with lysinuric protein intolerance. Thus, it is recommended to avoid arginine-containing supplements or foods.
