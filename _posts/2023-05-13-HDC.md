# Gene Information Analysis: HDC

## Basic Information
- **Gene Name:** HDC (Histidine Decarboxylase)
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 15
- **Aliases:** HDC1, L-Histidine decarboxylase, histidine carboxylase

## Function
- HDC gene encodes the enzyme histidine decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of histidine to histamine. Histamine functions as a neurotransmitter and a mediator of inflammatory responses in the body.

## External IDs and Links
- **HGNC ID:** 4870
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 3067
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000137869
- **OMIM ID:** 142720
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q99259

## Known Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in HDC gene, resulting in alterations in amino acids. The most frequent mutations are Asp697Gly (rs17740607), Thr748Ser (rs2298809), and Val521Ile (rs854149).
- **Mutation Type:** SNPs
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs17740607, rs2298809, rs854149

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in HDC gene.

## Related Diseases
- HDC is associated with several diseases including asthma, allergies, anaphylaxis, and digestive system disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment of HDC-related diseases involves the use of antihistamines to block histamine receptors and reduce inflammation. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
- Several drugs are known to interact with HDC gene including proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).
