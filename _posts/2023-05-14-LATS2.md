## Gene LATS2

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 13
- Location: 13q11

### Pathology
LATS2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 2) is a tumor suppressor gene associated with various cancer types, including lung, breast, and ovarian cancers.

### Function
LATS2 plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell division, and cell death.
