## Function of CNOT3 gene
CNOT3 encodes a protein that is a subunit of the carbon catabolite repression 4-negative on TATA-less (CCR4-NOT) complex. This complex plays a critical role in gene regulation through its ability to deadenylate mRNA molecules. Specifically, CNOT3 is involved in suppressing gene expression by selectively recruiting mRNA molecules with distinct features for degradation via deadenylation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
So far, several missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the CNOT3 gene. The following table lists the SNPs with their corresponding amino acid (AA) change, mutation type, and dbSNP ID:

| SNP ID | AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CNOT3 gene have been associated with various diseases, including familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE) and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
At present, there are no targeted treatments available for CNOT3-related diseases, and the prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and its severity.

## Drug Response
Currently, no drugs have been developed that specifically target the CNOT3 gene.
