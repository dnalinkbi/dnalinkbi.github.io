## Gene Information

### Gene: ABCB1
#### Function: 
The ABCB1 gene encodes a member of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) subgroup of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters. The protein acts as a drug transporter, expelling xenobiotics and drugs from cells. 

#### External IDs: 
- HGNC: 20
- NCBI Entrez: 5243
- Ensembl: ENSG00000085563
- OMIM: 171050
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08183

#### Genomic Location: 
ABCB1 is located on chromosome 7q21.12.

#### Aliases:
- ABC20
- CD243
- MDR1
- P-GP
- PGY1 

#### AA Mutation List: 
There are various mutations that have been identified in the ABCB1 gene, some of which are:
- rs2235067 (C3435T)
- rs1128503 (C1236T)
- rs2032582 (G2677T/A)

#### Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:
- rs2235067 (C3435T) : missense variant - p.Ile1145Ile with a dbSNP ID of rs2235067.
- rs1128503 (C1236T) : missense variant - p.Ser410Leu with a dbSNP ID of rs1128503.
- rs2032582 (G2677T/A) : missense variant - p.Ala893Ser with a dbSNP ID of rs2032582.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: 
There are some somatic SNVs/InDels that have been identified in the ABCB1 gene, some of which are:
- rs1045642 (C32T)
- rs2032583 (C2677T)
- rs1128501 (G1199T)

#### Related Disease:
Various diseases have been linked to the ABCB1 gene, some of which are:
- Epilepsy
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Cancer

#### Treatment and Prognosis: 
The ABCB1 gene is known to affect drug absorption and metabolism by transporting drugs out of cells. Thus, inhibiting its function can increase drug efficacy and can be used in cancer treatment. However, it can also lead to drug resistance in some diseases, such as epilepsy.

#### Drug Response: 
ABCB1 is responsible for the transport of various drugs, so different mutations in the gene can affect drug response. Moreover, inhibiting ABCB1 function can increase drug efficacy and can be used in cancer treatment.
