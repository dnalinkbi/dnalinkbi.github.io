# Information about gene IL1R1

IL1R1 is a gene located on chromosome 2 at position 2q11.2. It has aliases including CD121A, IL-1R, and IL-1RT1. The primary function of this gene is to encode a receptor protein that binds and responds to interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokines.

### External IDs

External IDs for IL1R1 include:

- HGNC: 5998
- NCBI Entrez: 3554
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116136
- OMIM: 147810
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P14778

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported mutations for the IL1R1 gene. According to dbSNP, some of the non-synonymous mutations include:

- Arg307Gly (rs3176866)
- Arg343Gln (rs2234649)
- Arg364Cys (rs2234651)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels with dbSNP ID for the IL1R1 gene.

### Related disease

Several studies have shown an association between IL1R1 gene and several diseases including:

- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Atherosclerosis
- Alzheimer's disease
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Systemic lupus erythematosus

### Treatment and prognosis

There is no specific treatment available for mutations in the IL1R1 gene. In diseases associated with the gene, treatment generally focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the disease and its severity.

### Drug response

There is limited evidence to suggest that IL1R1 antagonists may be effective in treating diseases associated with the IL1R1 gene. For example, the drug anakinra, which blocks the IL-1 receptor, has been shown to be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis.
