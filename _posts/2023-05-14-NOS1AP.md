# Genetic Information Analysis Report: Gene NOS1AP

## Gene Information
- Function: The NOS1AP gene encodes the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and is involved in regulating nNOS activity and localization in neurons.
- External IDs:
     - Gene: NOS1AP
     - Genomic Location: Chromosome 1: 22,262,310-22,318,109
     - Aliases: CAPON, KIAA1428, Neuron-enriched gene family member, DFNB79

## Sequence Information
- AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
    - rs12742393 (missense mutation): p.Pro858Leu
    - rs12022303 (synonymous mutation): p.Thr843Thr
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported.
    
## Pathology
- Related Disease: The NOS1AP gene has been associated with several diseases, including:
    - Schizophrenia: Multiple studies have reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOS1AP are associated with increased susceptibility to schizophrenia.
    - Cardiovascular Disease: Several SNPs in NOS1AP have been found to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
    
## Clinical Significance
- Treatment and Prognosis: As of now, there are no specific treatments available that target NOS1AP gene. However, better understanding of the role of this gene in disease can lead to the development of pharmacological interventions in the future. Prognosis is largely dependent on the specific disease associated with mutations in NOS1AP gene.
- Drug Response: There is no data available on drug response specific to mutations in NOS1AP gene.
