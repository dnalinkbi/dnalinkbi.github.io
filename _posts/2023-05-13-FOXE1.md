# Gene FOXE1

## Genetic position
The FOXE1 gene is located on chromosome 9q22.33.

## Pathology
Variations in the FOXE1 gene have been associated with congenital hypothyroidism, thyroid dysgenesis, and thyroid cancer.

## Function
FOXE1 is involved in the regulation of thyroid gland development. It plays a role in the formation of follicular cells in the thyroid gland, which in turn produce thyroid hormones.
