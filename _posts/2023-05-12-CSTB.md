## Gene CSTB information

### Genetic Position

The gene CSTB is located on chromosome 21 at the position 21q22.3.

### Pathology

The mutations in CSTB gene have been implicated in multiple disorders including progressive myoclonus epilepsy and Unverricht-Lundborg disease.

### Function

The CSTB gene encodes a protein known as cystatin B which belongs to the cystatin superfamily, a group of proteins that function as protease inhibitors. CSTB specifically inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases, which are important for protein degradation, antigen presentation, and apoptosis. 

### External IDs and aliases

### AA mutation list and mutation types with dbSNP ID

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
| p.Trp28Ter | Nonsense mutation | rs80339742 |
| p.Asp76Asn | Missense mutation | rs397514669 |
| p.Asn122Ser | Missense mutation | rs587777357 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID have been reported for CSTB gene.

### Related disease

The mutations in the CSTB gene are known to cause Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) or progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1), which are autosomal recessive disorders that affect the nervous system and cause seizures. 

### Treatment and prognosis

There is no known cure for ULD or EPM1, and treatment options are mainly supportive to manage the symptoms. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are frequently used to control seizures. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms, but life expectancy is generally not reduced.

### Drug response

There is limited information on drug response for ULD or EPM1, and treatment is mainly focused on managing the symptoms.
