# Gene Information for TRAC

## Gene Function
TRAC (T cell receptor alpha constant) is one of the two chains that form the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. The TCR is responsible for recognizing and binding to specific antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to T cell activation.

## External IDs, Genomic Location, and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: 12220, NCBI Gene ID: 6955, Ensembl: ENSG00000196126, OMIM: 186880, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01848
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 14q11.2
- Aliases: TCR, TRA, TCRA

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No significant AA mutations have been reported for TRAC in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No significant somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for TRAC in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
- Primary immunodeficiency diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be caused by mutations in the TRAC gene, leading to impaired T cell development and function.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for primary immunodeficiency diseases caused by TRAC mutations. Treatment options include bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy to replace the defective TRAC gene.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the primary immunodeficiency disease and the effectiveness of the chosen treatment.

## Drug Response
- There is no known drug that directly targets TRAC or TCR complex.
