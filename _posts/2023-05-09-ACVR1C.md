# Gene Information Analysis for ACVR1C

## Genetic Position and General Information 

* **Gene Symbol:** ACVR1C (Activin A receptor type 1C)
* **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2q23.1
* **Aliases:** ACVRLK7, ALK7, ACTR-IIC, Activin receptor-like kinase 7

## Function for Gene
The ACVR1C gene encodes a type I receptor of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of proteins. It plays a significant role in the TGF-beta signaling pathway and regulates numerous physiological processes, such as cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis.

## Related Diseases

ACVR1C mutations have been linked to different diseases such as colorectal cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and early-onset preeclampsia. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no standard treatment protocol for ACVR1C-associated diseases, and prognosis varies depending on the type and stage of the disease. Further investigation and clinical trials are required to develop targeted therapies for ACVR1C-related diseases.

## Drug Response

There is limited data on drug response for ACVR1C-associated diseases. Studies have highlighted that ACVR1C is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, and selective ACVR1C inhibitors are currently under investigation as anti-tumor agents.
