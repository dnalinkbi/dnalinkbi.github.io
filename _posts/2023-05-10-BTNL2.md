## Gene: BTNL2

**Pathology:** BTNL2 gene has been associated with several autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, and sarcoidosis.

**Function:** BTNL2 gene encodes a protein called butyrophilin-like 2 which is involved in the regulation of the immune system.
