### Gene: COX6B1

#### Information:

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 19: 4,063,613-4,065,141
- **Function**: COX6B1 encodes a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex which is involved in oxidative phosphorylation and is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
- **External IDs**: HGNC: 2222, Entrez Gene: 1338, Ensembl: ENSG00000104803, OMIM: 602646, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P14854
- **Aliases**: COX6B, COXVIb-1, CYC1, COX6B1P1

#### Mutations and Variations:

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: There are several known missense mutations in COX6B1, including rs4147923 (I29V), rs28931293 (G11R), and rs148696976 (S12I). 
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are currently no known somatic mutations in COX6B1 in any cancer types.

#### Related Disease:

- COX6B1 mutations have been associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial complex IV deficiency.
