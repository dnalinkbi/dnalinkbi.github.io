## Gene: SLC5A11

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 16
- Location: 16p13.3

### Pathology
SLC5A11 mutations have been associated with susceptibility to kidney stones and chondrocalcinosis.

### Function
The SLC5A11 gene encodes a membrane protein called sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter, which is involved in the transportation of myo-inositol.
