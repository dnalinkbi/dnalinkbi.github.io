# Gene: DLL1

- **Function:** The DLL1 gene encodes for a membrane-bound ligand protein that binds to the Notch receptor, activating the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in various processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**

   - HGNC: 2862
   - NCBI Entrez: 28514
   - Ensembl: ENSG00000137998
   - OMIM: 602768
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y219
   - Genomic Location: Chromosome 6p24.3

  **Aliases:**

  - Delta-like protein 1
  - Drosophila Delta homolog 1
  - Delta/Serrate/Lag-2

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

   - c.1096C>T (p.Arg366Trp) - rs750926544
   - c.573C>A (p.Asn191Lys) - rs72854742
   - c.1163C>T (p.Thr388Met) - rs775412778

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

   - c.80C>G (p.Pro27Ala) - rs869025845
   - c.201G>A (p.Asp67Asn) - rs78293716
   - c.1015A>G (p.Met339Val) - rs200214261

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the DLL1 gene have been associated with various diseases such as Alagille syndrome and spondylocostal dysostosis.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis for DLL1 gene-related diseases depend on the specific condition and severity of the mutations.

- **Drug Response:** There is currently no specific drug targeting the DLL1 protein. However, drugs targeting the Notch signaling pathway are being developed.
