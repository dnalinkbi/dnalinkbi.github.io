## Gene Information

The gene SLC11A1 is located on chromosome 2 and is also known as solute carrier family 11 member 1. This gene encodes a protein involved in the transport of divalent metal cations, such as iron and manganese, across membranes.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for SLC11A1 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease

Mutations in SLC11A1 have been associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy, as well as other bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for infectious diseases associated with SLC11A1 mutations vary depending on the specific condition. However, some treatment options may include antibiotics and other targeted therapies. Prognosis can also vary depending on the severity of the infection and individual factors.

## Drug Response

There are currently no known drug responses specifically associated with SLC11A1 mutations.
