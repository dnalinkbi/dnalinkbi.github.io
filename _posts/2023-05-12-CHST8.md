# Gene CHST8

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 19q13.3

**Pathology:** CHST8 gene plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of the sulfated glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS). Mutations in the CHST8 gene have been found to be associated with various pathological conditions, including leukodystrophy, cerebral dysfunction, and skeletal malformations.

**Function for Gene:** CHST8 gene is responsible for encoding the carbohydrate sulfotransferase 8 enzyme, which catalyzes the transfer of a sulfate group from a 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) donor to the C-4 hydroxyl group of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue in CS and HS. This sulfation process confers unique signaling properties to these sulfated carbohydrates, thereby regulating various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the CHST8 gene have been identified in patients with Skeletal Dysplasia-2 (OMIM #614135), which is characterized by short stature, delayed skeletal maturation, and various skeletal abnormalities. Another disease that has been linked to CHST8 mutation is Leukodystrophy, hypomyelinating, 12 (OMIM #616683), which is characterized by neurological symptoms, including ataxia, developmental delay, and muscular hypotonia.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no known cure for the genetic diseases associated with CHST8 mutation. Treatment is usually supportive and involves the management of symptoms. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset.

**Drug response:** There is currently no known drug specifically targeting CHST8 gene mutations. However, some drugs such as growth hormones, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin have been used to manage the skeletal abnormalities associated with Skeletal Dysplasia-2.
