# **Gene: BCLAF1**

---

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1 (1q24.3)
- **Pathology:** The BCLAF1 gene has been implicated in various types of cancer, including breast, liver, colon, and lung cancer. Additionally, mutations in BCLAF1 have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
- **Function:** The protein encoded by the BCLAF1 gene regulates mRNA splicing and stability, as well as apoptosis and cell cycle progression.
