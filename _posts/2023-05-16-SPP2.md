# **Information about Gene SPP2**

### **Genetic position**
The gene SPP2 is located on human chromosome 11 at the position 11q13.1.

### **Pathology and Function**
The SPP2 gene encodes a protein called secreted phosphoprotein 2 (SPP2) which is expressed in various tissues including bone, cartilage, and skin. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and mineralization. Studies suggest that SPP2 may play a role in bone metabolism and contribute to diseases like osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

### **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
There are several somatic mutations reported in the SPP2 gene with their associated dbSNP ID:

|Mutation type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|
|Missense|rs879255473|
|Nonsense|rs267608274|
|In-frame |rs879255474|

### **Related disease**
Studies suggest that the SPP2 may be involved in the development of several skeletal disorders like osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

### **Treatment and Prognosis**
There is no specific treatment available for mutations in the SPP2 gene. However, certain therapies can be given to improve bone mineralization in cases of osteoporosis.

### **Drug response**
No drugs have been approved specifically for treatment of SPP2 gene-related diseases. However, some drugs like bisphosphonates and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) can be used to improve bone density.
