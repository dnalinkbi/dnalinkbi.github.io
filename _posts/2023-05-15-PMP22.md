# Information on Gene PMP22

## Genetic Position and Genomic Information
- PMP22 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p12).
- The genomic location of PMP22 is NC_000017.11.
- The external gene and genomic IDs for PMP22 are:
    - Gene ID: 5376
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000171444
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 5376
    - HGNC ID: 9208
- PMP22 also has various aliases such as CMT, HMSNIA, GAS3, HNPP, and others.

## Function of PMP22 Gene
- The PMP22 gene codes for peripheral myelin protein 22, a protein that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of myelin sheath around the axons of peripheral nerves.
- Myelin sheath is crucial for proper conduction of nerve impulses.
- PMP22 also regulates the differentiation of Schwann cells and is involved in the process of myelination.

## Mutation Information
- Mutations in PMP22 gene cause various disease conditions such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS).
- Several missense mutations, insertions, deletions, and duplications of PMP22 gene have been identified that cause these diseases.
- Some of the common mutations include:
    - c.601C>T (p.Arg201*): This nonsense mutation is associated with HNPP and CMT neuropathies. It results in premature termination of the PMP22 protein synthesis leading to a truncated protein.
    - c.230dupG (p.Asn77fs): This frameshift mutation is associated with CMT1A neuropathy. It results in the addition of an extra guanine nucleotide that alters the reading frame of the protein synthesis leading to a truncated protein.
    - c.116G>A (p.Cys39Tyr): This missense mutation is associated with HNPP syndrome. It alters the amino acid sequence in the PMP22 protein, leading to its malfunction.
- Additional information on AA changes and mutation types with dbSNP ID can be found at dbSNP (rs) database.

## Related Diseases
- The major disease conditions associated with PMP22 mutations are:
    - Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease: It is a group of inherited neuromuscular disorders that affect the peripheral nerves and cause weakness and muscle wasting in the limbs.
    - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP): It is a rare inherited condition that affects the peripheral nerves and causes episodes of numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness under pressure.
    - Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS): It is a rare inherited neuropathy that affects the peripheral nerves and causes muscle weakness, sensory loss, and foot deformities.
- The severity and progression of symptoms vary with the type of mutation and disease condition.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for PMP22-related diseases.
- Treatment mainly involves managing symptoms such as pain, weakness, and sensory loss.
- Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic surgery may be helpful in improving mobility and function in patients with severe symptoms.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease, age of onset, and type of mutation. 

## Drug Response
- Some studies have suggested that drugs targeting PMP22 expression and function may be beneficial in treating PMP22-related diseases.
- However, further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of such drugs.
