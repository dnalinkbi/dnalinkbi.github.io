# Gene Information

### Gene Name: LIF

LIF stands for "Leukemia Inhibitory Factor". It is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 22q12. It is a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines.

### Function of Gene

LIF is involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It plays a crucial role in embryonic development, implantation, and immune response. LIF signals through the LIF receptor and activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

### External IDs and Aliases

- Gene ID: 3976
- Genomic Location: Chr22:36,834,284-36,839,062
- Other Aliases: HILDA, DIA, MLPLI


### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several non-synonymous mutations reported for the LIF gene, mostly associated with cancer. The following is a list of some of the mutations along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| F104S | Missense | rs794726651 |
| V146A | Missense | rs762917272 |
| G148R | Missense | rs778332019 |
| W193R | Missense | rs777205473 |
| R203H | Missense | rs786205599 |
| D207E | Missense | rs767186844 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID

Several somatic SNVs and InDels have also been reported in the LIF gene. Here is a table with a few examples:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| c.90+3A>G | Splice Site | rs371420 \\
| c.227-693G>A | Intron | rs373331 \\
| c.315G>A | Missense | rs371358\\
| c.224-577T>C | Intron | rs373437\\

### Related Diseases

LIF has been associated with several diseases, including:

- Leukemia
- Breast cancer
- Melanoma
- Preeclampsia
- Multiple sclerosis
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease

### Treatment and Prognosis

As LIF is involved in the immune response, it has been explored as a potential therapeutic target for various diseases. The use of LIF antagonists has been suggested for the treatment of breast cancer. Additionally, LIF has been investigated as a potential agent for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis.

### Drug Response

There is limited information regarding the drug response of LIF. However, a study has reported that a specific LIF variant may influence the responsiveness to lithium therapy in bipolar disorder.
