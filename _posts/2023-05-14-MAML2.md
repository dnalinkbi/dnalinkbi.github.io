## Gene MAML2

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 11
- Position: 19,427,877 - 19,459,604 bp

### Pathology:
- MAML2 gene rearrangements have been found in various malignancies such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, Warthin tumor, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma.

### Function:
- MAML2 is involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which plays an important role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 6842
- NCBI Entrez: 84441
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130283
- OMIM: 606893
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IZL2

### AA Mutation List:
- There are several AA mutations reported in the MAML2 gene, including p.Lys644, p.Glu958, and p.Glu975. 
- The mutation type is a missense mutation.
- dbSNP IDs: rs398122542, rs398122540, rs398122541

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the MAML2 gene, including c.2912A>G, c.2533C>T, c.2534G>A, and c.2908G>A. 
- dbSNP IDs: rs146155651, rs140276139, rs140797199, rs146155652

### Related Disease:
- MAML2 gene rearrangements have been associated with several malignancies such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, Warthin tumor, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- The treatment and prognosis of MAML2 gene rearrangement-associated malignancies vary depending on the cancer type, stage, and other factors.

### Drug Response:
- There is no specific drug that targets the MAML2 gene or its associated malignancies.
