# Information about gene HDAC9

## Genetic Position
HDAC9 (Histone deacetylase 9) is a protein-coding gene located on the human chromosome 7, specifically on the 7p21.1 region.

## Pathology
Variants in HDAC9 are associated with several diseases such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and ischemic stroke. HDAC9 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.

## Function 
HDAC9 encodes a class II histone deacetylase which regulates multiple cellular processes including gene transcription, cell proliferation, and differentiation.
