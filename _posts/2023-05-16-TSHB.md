# Gene: TSHB

## Information 

- **Function:** TSHB (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Beta) gene encodes the beta-subunit of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is a glycoprotein hormone that regulates thyroid gland function. TSHB binds to specific receptors in the thyroid gland to regulate the production of thyroid hormones. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

  - **Gene ID:** 7252
  - **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1, q21.1
  - **Aliases:** TSHB, TSH-B, CSHB, LSH-B, PRSS2, Thyroid-stimulating hormone subunit beta

- **Related diseases:**

  - Hypothyroidism
  - Pituitary tumors
  - Resistance to TSH

- **Treatment and prognosis:**

  - The treatment for hypothyroidism typically involves hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine, which is a synthetic form of thyroid hormone that helps to regulate the body's metabolism.
  - The prognosis of pituitary tumors depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the age and health of the patient. Surgery, radiation therapy, and medications may be used to treat pituitary tumors, and the prognosis varies depending on the individual case.
  
- **Drug response:**

  - TSH receptor agonists and antagonists can be used to treat TSH-related disorders, such as Graves' disease and TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas.
