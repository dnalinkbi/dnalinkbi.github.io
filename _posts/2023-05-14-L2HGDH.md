# Gene: L2HGDH

### Basic Information
- Function: Encodes the enzyme L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which is involved in the catabolism of L-2-hydroxyglutarate.
- External IDs and Genomic location: 
    - HGNC ID: 17904
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 79728
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000172936
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 14q22.1
- Aliases:
    - L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
    - L2HGDL
    - LADH
    - L2HADH
    - FLJ23314

### Mutations
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - p.Glu220Asp - Missense - rs138346962
    - p.Gly220Arg - Missense - rs121918101
    - p.Leu7Pro - Missense - rs80338869
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - No reported somatic mutations

### Related Disease
- L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L2HGA): a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the L2HGDH gene, characterized by the accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in the brain and urine, resulting in progressive neurological symptoms such as seizures, ataxia, and intellectual disability.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for L2HGA. However, treatment is focused on managing symptoms and may include anticonvulsants, physical therapy, and speech therapy.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms, but the disorder is generally progressive and can be life-limiting.

### Drug Response
- No significant information found regarding drug response
