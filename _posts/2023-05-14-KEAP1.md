## Gene: KEAP1

### Function:
KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) is a negative regulator of the NRF2-dependent antioxidant response pathway. KEAP1 modulates NRF2 activity through proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination under normal conditions, promoting the degradation of NRF2. Under stress conditions, KEAP1-NRF2 interaction is disrupted, leading to nuclear translocation and binding of NRF2 to DNA to promote the transcription of its target genes.

### Related disease:
KEAP1 mutations are associated with increased susceptibility to various carcinomas, including lung, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
KEAP1 mutations have been identified as potential targets for cancer therapies. Targeting KEAP1 with small molecules has been evaluated in preclinical studies, with promising results in reducing tumor growth. The prognosis of cancer patients with KEAP1 mutations is generally unfavorable, but this may vary depending on the specific type of cancer.

### Drug response:
Several drugs have been identified to target the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, including bardoxolone methyl and sulforaphane. Bardoxolone methyl has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of various diseases involving inflammation and oxidative stress, such as chronic kidney disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
