# Information on Gene SLC26A9

## Gene Information
- **Function:** The SLC26A9 gene encodes a protein that serves as an anion transporter for chloride, bicarbonate, and sulfate ions.

- **External IDs:** HGNC: 17161, NCBI Entrez: 115111, Ensembl: ENSG00000122785, OMIM: 611507, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q4KMQ2

- **Aliases:** CFTRc2, ANO4

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1, 230,263,867 - 230,313,667 bp

## Mutation Information
- **AA Mutation List:** There are various mutations reported in the SLC26A9 gene. Some of the common ones are:
    - R298Q (rs79367043)
    - G367V (rs143838631)
    - N378S (rs764875188)
    
- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations

- **dbSNP ID:** rs79367043, rs143838631, rs764875188

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There is no significant data reported regarding the Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.

## Related Diseases
- The mutations in SLC26A9 are associated with a wide range of diseases, including:
    - Cystic Fibrosis
    - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    - Asthma
    - Bronchitis

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment available for mutations in SLC26A9. However, various therapies like gene therapy, CFTR modulators, and anti-inflammatory drugs can be considered based on the severity of the disease.

- The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease associated with the mutations in SLC26A9.

## Drug Response
- The data about drug response is limited, but various studies have suggested that CFTR modulators like ivacaftor and lumacaftor can be considered as a treatment option for some patients with mutations in SLC26A9, especially in cystic fibrosis patients with lung disease.
