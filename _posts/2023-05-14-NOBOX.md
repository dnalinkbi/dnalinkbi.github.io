## Information about gene NOBOX

- **Gene:** NOBOX
- **External IDs:** HGNC:14757, NCBI Entrez Gene:84823, Ensembl:ENSG00000152777, OMIM:610934, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q8N136
- **Aliases:** PHX2, ZNF699

### **Genetic Position**

- **Chromosome:** 7
- **Location:** q35

### **Pathology**

- **Related disease:** Premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
     - R44X (rs61731286)
     - R355W (rs113993984)
     - R469W (rs113993985)
     - T469M (rs151319346)

 - **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
     - There are no known somatic mutations in NOBOX.

### **Function for gene**

NOBOX is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in ovarian development and function. It is expressed in oocytes and early follicles, and regulates the expression of genes important for folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, and oocyte meiosis. Mutations in NOBOX are associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), a condition characterized by the depletion or dysfunction of ovarian follicles before the age of 40.

### **Treatment and prognosis**

There is currently no cure for premature ovarian failure. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications, such as osteoporosis and heart disease. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be used to restore estrogen levels and alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.

### **Drug response**

There is no known drug therapy specifically targeting NOBOX mutations. However, HRT can be effective in managing symptoms of premature ovarian failure.
