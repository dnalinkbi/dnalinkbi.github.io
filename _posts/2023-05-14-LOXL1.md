## Information about Gene LOXL1

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- Gene: LOXL1
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 15q24.1
- Pathology: LOXL1 has been associated with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG).
- Function: LOXL1 encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase family of proteins, which play a role in the formation and repair of connective tissues. Specifically, LOXL1 is involved in the cross-linking of extracellular matrix proteins.

- NCBI Entrez ID: 4016
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000152422
- OMIM ID: 603544
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q08397
- Aliases: LOR, LOX3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- AA Mutation List: Several coding variants have been identified in LOXL1, including R141L (rs1048661), G153D (rs3825942), and L384F (rs2165241).
- Mutation Type: Missense mutations
- dbSNP ID: rs1048661, rs3825942, rs2165241

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified in LOXL1 in the COSMIC database.

### Related Disease

- Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG)

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, there is no cure for XFS or XFG. Treatment options include medications to lower intraocular pressure and surgery to improve fluid drainage.
- The prognosis can vary and may depend on the severity of the disease and how well it responds to treatment.

### Drug Response

- There is limited information on drug response related to LOXL1 mutations.
