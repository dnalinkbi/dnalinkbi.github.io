# NR2E1 Gene

## Description
NR2E1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 1) is a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q21-q22). It encodes a transcriptional repressor protein that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily.

## Function
The protein product of NR2E1 plays a role in regulating gene expression during development, particularly in the differentiation of the visual system, central nervous system, and endocrine organs. It is also involved in the maintenance of neural stem cell identity and suppression of neural differentiation.
