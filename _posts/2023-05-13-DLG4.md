# Information about gene DLG4

## Genomic position, Aliases, and External IDs

- The gene DLG4 (Discs large homolog 4) is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17q12.
- Other aliases of DLG4 gene are PSD95, SAP90, DLGH1, and SAP-90.
- The external sites for DLG4 gene are:
    - HGNC: HGNC:2944
    - NCBI Entrez: 1742
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000100243
    - OMIM: 602366
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P78352

## Function of gene

- DLG4 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs). 
- It plays a crucial role in the organization and function of synaptic connections between neurons by anchoring neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and signaling molecules.
- DLG4 protein is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, which are critical in learning and memory processes.

## Mutations in DLG4 gene

- The amino acid mutation list and mutation type with the dbSNP ID of DLG4 gene can be found in dbSNP database.
- DLG4 gene is known to have somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.
- The most common variant in DLG4 gene is rs2227982, which leads to a serine to leucine substitution at a position 321 in the protein.

## Related disease

- Studies have shown that mutations in DLG4 gene are associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy.
- DLG4 gene mutations have also been linked to cognitive impairments and memory deficits.

## Treatment and prognosis

- Currently, there is no specific treatment available for genetic mutations in DLG4 gene.
- Treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with DLG4 mutations is mostly based on symptomatic relief and management of psychiatric symptoms.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and individual response to treatment.

## Drug response

- A study has shown that DLG4 gene expression levels are altered in response to treatment with antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs.
- The precise mechanism of how DLG4 gene expression changes in response to these drugs is not yet fully understood.
