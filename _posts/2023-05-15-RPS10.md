# Gene RPS10

## Gene Information
RPS10 is the symbol for Ribosomal protein S10 gene. It is located on chromosome 6 in humans and its genomic location is 6p23.2. The aliases for RPS10 gene are S10, RPS10A, RPS10E, and HLD9.

## Function
Ribosomal protein S10 is a crucial component of the small (40S) subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome. It is involved in protein synthesis and interacts with messenger RNA and other ribosomal proteins. RPS10 has also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.
