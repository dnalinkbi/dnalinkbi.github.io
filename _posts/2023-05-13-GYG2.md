# Information on Gene GYG2

## Genetic Position
Gene: GYG2 (Glycogenin-2)  
Location: Chromosome 11q23.3  
Pathology: Autosomal recessive  

## Function
The GYG2 gene encodes for glycogenin-2, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of glycogen. Glycogenin-2 acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis by catalyzing the addition of glucose molecules to form a linear chain.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported in the GYG2 gene, some of which are:
- c.1526G>A (p.Gly509Ser), missense mutation [dbSNP ID: rs3735662]
- c.371C>T (p.Ala124Val), missense mutation [dbSNP ID: rs386352310]
- c.1559_1560insA (p.Asp520fs), frameshift mutation [dbSNP ID: rs749582110]  

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the GYG2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the GYG2 gene have been associated with glycogen storage disease type XV (GSDXV), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal glycogen deposits in muscle and liver tissues.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for GSDXV. Treatment mainly involves dietary modifications and management of symptoms, which can include exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and liver dysfunction. The prognosis of GSDXV varies depending on the severity of the disease and individual response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug that has been approved for the treatment of GSDXV.
