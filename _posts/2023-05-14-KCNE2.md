**Gene:** KCNE2

**Function for gene:** 
KCNE2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv7.1) beta subunit, which regulates potassium ion currents in the heart and other tissues.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
- HGNC: 6244
- NCBI Entrez: 9992
- Ensembl: ENSG00000155650
- OMIM: 603796
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60506

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Asp76Asn (rs74315437)
- p.Thr8Met (rs149999662)
- p.Asn54His (rs1805127)
- p.Asn54Ser (rs143603412)
- p.Gly53Arg (rs141244591)
- p.Met54Val (rs138055878)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
None reported.

**Related disease:**
Mutations in KCNE2 have been associated with long QT syndrome (LQT6) which is a cardiac arrhythmia disorder characterized by prolonged QT interval and risk of sudden cardiac death.

**Treatment and prognosis:**
Treatment for individuals with LQT6 typically include beta-blockers and implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. The prognosis for individuals with LQT6 depends on the severity of their condition and how well they respond to treatment.

**Drug response:**
Individuals with mutations in KCNE2 may respond differently to drugs such as beta-blockers and mexiletine, which are commonly used to treat long QT syndrome.
