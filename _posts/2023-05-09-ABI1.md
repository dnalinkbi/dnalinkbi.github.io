## Gene ABI1

### Information

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 10: 77,589,124-77,738,230
- **Pathology**: ABI1 has been found to play a role in various cancers, including breast, lung, and prostate cancers. It is also associated with Alzheimer's disease.
- **Function**: ABI1 regulates signaling processes in cells through its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules. It is involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, endocytosis, and cell adhesion.
- **External IDs**: 

    - Genomic Location: NC_000010.11 (NCBI RefSeq) 
    - Gene ID: 10006 
    - HGNC ID: 52 
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000005381 
    - OMIM ID: 601366 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8IZP0
    - Aliases: AblBP2, Abi-1, E3B1

- **Related Disease:** 
    - Breast cancer 
    - Lung cancer 
    - Prostate cancer 
    - Alzheimer's disease
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - There is currently no known cure for cancers associated with ABI1 mutations, and treatment options depend on the type and stage of cancer. 
    - For Alzheimer's disease, treatment options include medications to manage symptoms and lifestyle changes, but there is currently no cure.
    
- **Drug Response:**
    - Some studies have explored the potential of targeting ABI1 as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, but further research is needed.
