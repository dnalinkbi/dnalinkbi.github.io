## Gene BTK

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome Xq22.1

**Pathology:** Mutations in BTK gene are associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder. 

**Function:** The BTK gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in B-cell development, maturation, and signaling.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 1138
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 695
- Ensembl: ENSG00000120708
- OMIM: 300300
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q06187

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Cys481Phe (missense mutation) - rs28933391
- p.Arg562* (nonsense mutation) - rs104894398
- p.Gly538Ser (missense mutation) - rs116781646
- p.Val142Leu (missense mutation) - rs267607155
- p.Pro504Leu (missense mutation) - rs104894402

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic mutations have been reported for the BTK gene.

**Related Disease:** X-linked agammaglobulinemia

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for XLA involves intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy to replace deficient immunoglobulins. Stem cell transplantation can be a curative treatment for XLA, but the risks associated with the procedure limit its use. The prognosis for patients with XLA is good with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, as it can prevent life-threatening bacterial infections.

**Drug Response:** Patients with XLA receive IVIG therapy for life, and it has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of bacterial infections. BTK inhibitors such as Ibrutinib are used in the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
