## Information about Gene CBR3 

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

CBR3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 at position 21q22.1. It is a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily and encodes a protein that functions as a carbonyl reductase enzyme, involved in xenobiotic metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis. The CBR3 protein has been shown to play a significant role in the metabolism of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, which are commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for various cancers including breast cancer and leukemia.

### Function for Gene

The CBR3 gene encodes the carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3) enzyme that performs various functions such as xenobiotic metabolism, prostaglandin synthesis, and drug metabolism.

### Related Disease

Variants in the CBR3 gene have been associated with several diseases such as
- Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)
- Alcohol dependence
- Diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent

### Treatment and Prognosis

The CBR3 gene has been implicated in drug metabolism, especially for chemotherapeutic agents like anthracyclines. Thus, alterations in the activity of the CBR3 enzyme due to genetic variations can affect the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs. Further studies are required to understand the implications of CBR3 mutations in disease prognosis and treatment.

### Drug Response

The CBR3 enzyme is involved in the metabolism of several drugs, including chemotherapeutic agents like anthracyclines. Alterations in the CBR3 activity due to genetic mutations or polymorphisms can affect the efficacy, toxicity, and metabolism of these drugs.
