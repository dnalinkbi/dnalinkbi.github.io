# Information about the FGF2 Gene 

#### Gene Function 
FGF2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes including angiogenesis, wound healing, and cell growth and differentiation.

#### Related Disease 
Elevated levels of FGF2 have been associated with multiple diseases such as cancers (e.g. breast, prostate, colon), atherosclerosis, and diabetic retinopathy.

#### Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no approved treatments that directly target FGF2, but drugs targeting FGF receptors are being developed for certain cancers. FGF2 levels may also be used for prognostic purposes in some cancers.

#### Drug Response
The use of FGF inhibitors, such as PD173074 and BGJ398, have shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of various cancers.
