# Gene PRSS8

- **Function**: The PRSS8 gene encodes for a type II transmembrane serine protease which is expressed in various tissues and has a role in proteolytic processing and activation of several other proteins. It is involved in the regulation of different biological processes such as epithelial barrier function, angiogenesis, and insulin sensitivity.
