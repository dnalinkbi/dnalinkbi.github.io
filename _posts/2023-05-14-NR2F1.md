## Gene: NR2F1

**Function:** NR2F1 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group F, Member 1) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the development of various organs, including the brain, heart, and endocrine system. It is involved in the regulation of genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels in NR2F1 that have been reported in various cancers. None of these have dbSNP IDs.

**Related Diseases:** mutations in NR2F1 have been associated with several disorders, including:

- Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome
- Syndromic intellectual disability
- Central sleep apnea
- Hypogonadism
- Neurodevelopmental disorders

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for disorders linked to NR2F1 mutations is largely supportive and focuses on management of symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

**Drug Response:** There are currently no drugs targeting NR2F1.
