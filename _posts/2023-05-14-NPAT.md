## Information on Gene NPAT

### Genetic Position

The NPAT gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q12.1.

### Pathology 

The NPAT gene is implicated in several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and breast cancer. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene have been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.

### Function

The NPAT gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle progression. It is involved in the processes of DNA replication and chromosome assembly during the S-phase of the cell cycle.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several missense mutations in the NPAT gene, including:
- p.Asp209His (rs121912888)
- p.Arg382Gln (rs767415719)
- p.Asp433Glu (rs758811573)
- p.Ile671Thr (rs76830197)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations found in the NPAT gene across different cancers, including:

- c.3539G>A (p.Arg1180Gln) (rs797522054)
- c.3610T>C (p.Leu1204Pro) (rs141959381)
- c.3731G>A (p.Gly1244Ser) (rs797523296)

### Related Disease

Mutations or dysregulation of the NPAT gene have been implicated in several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and breast cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for patients with NPAT-related cancer depend on the specific type and stage of cancer. In general, targeted therapies that address the underlying genetic defect may be effective in some cases.

### Drug Response

There is limited information on drug response in patients with NPAT-related cancer, as current treatment strategies typically involve standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
