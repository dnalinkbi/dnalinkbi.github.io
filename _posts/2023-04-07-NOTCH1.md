# Gene Information: NOTCH1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 9
- Genomic Location: 9q34.3
- Gene ID: 4851

## Pathology
NOTCH1 mutations have been associated with various pathologies including:
- T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

## Function
NOTCH1 protein is a transmembrane receptor that plays a role in various cellular processes including cell fate determination, differentiation, and proliferation. It functions in a pathway known as the Notch signaling pathway.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 7881
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 4851
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000104855
- OMIM ID: 190198
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P46531
- Aliases: TAN1, AOS5

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.P2514A (rs121913340)
- p.P2514L (rs121913338)
- p.P2514R (rs28939987)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are numerous somatic mutations found in various cancers with dbSNP IDs. 

## Related Disease
- T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeted therapy and chemotherapy have been used to treat cancers with NOTCH1 mutations. Prognosis varies depending on the type of cancer and the stage at which it is diagnosed.

## Drug Response
Gamma-secretase inhibitors have been developed as potential treatments for NOTCH1-mutated cancers.
