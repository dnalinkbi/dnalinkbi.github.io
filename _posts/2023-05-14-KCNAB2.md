# Genetic information analysis of gene KCNAB2

## Gene information

- **Function:** The KCNAB2 gene codes for a protein called potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A regulatory beta subunit 2. This protein is involved in the regulation of potassium ion channels, which play a crucial role in neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release.
- **External IDs:** Gene ID: 8515, Genomic location: Chromosome 1q21.3, Aliases: KvÎ²2, KCHIP2
- **External sites:** [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:6246),) [NCBI Entrez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8515),) [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000143207;r=1:150040189-150082275),) [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/search/?index=geneMap&start=1&search=KCNAB2),) [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13303)

## Genetic variations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Multiple missense mutations have been reported in the KCNAB2 gene, including p.Arg29Cys (rs139257267), p.Asp111Glu (rs138986347), p.Val125Met (rs138397970), etc.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No somatic mutations have been reported in KCNAB2 to date.

## Pathology and Related diseases
- **Related diseases:** The dysfunction of KCNAB2 has been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and epilepsy.
 
## Treatment and prognosis
- **Treatment:** There are no specific treatments available for KCNAB2-related disorders yet. Current treatments mainly aim to alleviate symptoms, such as antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing drugs for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis of KCNAB2-related disorders varies depending on the severity of symptoms and individual response to treatment.

## Drug response
- Some studies suggest that the KCNAB2 gene may play a role in drug response to antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. For example, a study found that the p.Arg29Cys variant of KCNAB2 was associated with a lower response to clozapine in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
