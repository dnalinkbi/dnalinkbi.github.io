# Gene CFHR5

## Genetic Position
CFHR5 is located on chromosome 1q32.3.

## Pathology
Variants in the CFHR5 gene have been associated with several diseases such as IgA Nephropathy, and Age-related Macular Degeneration.

## Function
The CFHR5 gene encodes for complement factor H-related protein 5, which is involved in the regulation of the complement system, a part of the immune system that helps to defend against infections.
