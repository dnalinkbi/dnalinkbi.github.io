## Gene: OR13G1

### Genetic Position
The OR13G1 gene is located on chromosome 9q34.3.

### Pathology and Function
OR13G1 encodes a protein called olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily G member 1, which is a receptor protein involved in detecting odorants. Specifically, this protein is involved in detecting floral odors.
