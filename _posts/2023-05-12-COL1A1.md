## Gene: COL1A1

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 17q21.33

**Function**: COL1A1 gene encodes the alpha1 chain of type I collagen, the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and tendon extracellular matrix. Type I collagen provides tensile strength and resistance to stretching and is vital for bone development and integrity.

**External IDs**: 
- HGNC: 2200
- NCBI Entrez: 1277
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108821
- OMIM: 120150
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P02452

**Aliases**: OI4, OI, OTS, osteogenesis imperfecta

**AA Mutation List**:

Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID

**Somatic SNVs/InDels**: None reported

**Related Disease**: 
- Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of rare genetic disorders that primarily affect the bones. Various mutations in COL1A1 gene have been found to cause different types of OI, which range in severity from mild to severe or lethal forms.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment options for OI are supportive including medications to strengthen bones, physical therapy, and surgery to correct deformities. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition.

**Drug Response**: There is no specific drug treatment for OI but bisphosphonates have been shown to improve bone density and decrease fracture risk in some patients.
