# Information about gene CTSC

## Gene Description
CTSC, also known as cathepsin C, encodes for a lysosomal exopeptidase that is involved in the activation of several granule-associated proteases in immune cells, including mast cells, neutrophils, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

## Function
The protein encoded by CTSC is involved in the degradation of proteins inside the lysosome and plays a role in antigen processing and presentation. In immune cells, it activates serine proteases by cleaving off their propeptides. CTSC also cleaves antimicrobial peptides and may have a role in innate immunity.

## Related Diseases
- Papillon-Lefevre syndrome: a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and severe early-onset periodontitis. Mutations in CTSC have been associated with this condition.
- Haim-Munk syndrome: another rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by palmoplantar keratosis, periodontitis, and arachnodactyly, among other symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for Papillon-Lefevre syndrome is largely symptomatic and may include antibiotics, dental treatment, and skin care. In severe cases, bone marrow transplantation has been attempted with limited success.
- Prognosis for individuals with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome is highly variable and is dependent on the severity of the disease and the success of treatment.
- There is currently no cure for Haim-Munk syndrome and management is largely supportive.

## Drug Response
- Drugs that inhibit CTSC activity have been investigated as potential treatments for a range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. There is also some evidence that CTSC inhibitors could be effective in treating certain cancers by blocking tumor growth and metastasis.
