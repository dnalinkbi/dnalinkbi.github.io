## Gene: MTFMT

### Genetic Position and Pathology

- **Chromosome location:** 15q23
- **Pathology:** MTFMT (mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and disease.

### Function

- **Function of MTFMT:** MTFMT plays a crucial role in protein synthesis within mitochondria. It is responsible for the addition of a formyl group to the initiator methionyl-tRNA, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis within the mitochondrial matrix.

### External IDs and Aliases

- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 17029
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 139378
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000166203
    - OMIM: 615994
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HCE3
- **Aliases:** 
    - FMT, COXPD24

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- Currently, there are no reported missense or synonymous mutations in the MTFMT gene in the NCBI database.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Currently, there are no reported somatic mutations in the MTFMT gene in the NCBI database.

### Related Disease 

- **Related Disease:** Leigh syndrome with leukodystrophy (LSLD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the MTFMT gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for Leigh syndrome with leukodystrophy. However, treatments such as thiamine, biotin, and coenzyme Q10 have been used with some success in treating symptoms of the disease. The prognosis for individuals with LSLD is generally poor.

### Drug response

- Currently, there is no known drug response associated with mutations in the MTFMT gene.
