# Gene Information

## Gene Name
MUC7

## Function
The MUC7 gene encodes a mucin protein that plays a crucial role in human saliva. It is involved in lubricating and protecting oral surfaces, facilitating speech and swallowing, and preventing microbial infections.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7500
- NCBI Entrez: 4586
- Ensembl: ENSG00000147954
- OMIM: 158371
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8TAX0

## Genomic Location
The MUC7 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q13.3).

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the MUC7 gene. Some of them include:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| R62C | Missense | rs13306337 |
| C336S | Missense | rs34706714 |
| L480P | Missense | rs144488653 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in the MUC7 gene.

## Related Disease
There is no known disease that is directly caused by mutations in MUC7. However, MUC7 has been associated with several oral diseases, including dental caries, periodontitis, and Sjogren's syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no treatment or cure for mutations in the MUC7 gene. However, the oral complications associated with these mutations can be managed through proper dental care and regular checkups.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeted towards mutations in the MUC7 gene.
