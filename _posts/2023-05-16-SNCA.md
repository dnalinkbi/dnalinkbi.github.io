# Gene Symbol: SNCA 

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4 (4q22.1)
- **Pathology:** Parkinson’s Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and other neurodegenerative disorders
- **Function:** SNCA encodes for alpha-synuclein, a protein primarily expressed in neurons that plays a role in synaptic function, vesicle trafficking, and neurotransmitter release.

## General Gene Information

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 7878
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 6622
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000145386
    - OMIM: 163890
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P37840
    - Aliases: NACP, PARK1, PD1

## Variants

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:** Multiple missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations have been identified in the SNCA gene, including:
    - A53T (rs63750215)
    - A30P (rs63750450)
    - E46K (rs121908001)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.
- **Common SNPs:** Multiple common SNPs have been identified in SNCA, including:
    - rs356182 (5'UTR)
    - rs11931074 (intron 4)

## Related Diseases

- **Parkinson’s Disease (PD):** SNCA is one of the most important genes linked to the development of PD, and mutations in SNCA are associated with an early onset and more severe form of the disease.
- **Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB):** Aggregates of alpha-synuclein protein in the form of Lewy bodies are also found in the brains of DLB patients.
- **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):** Like PD and DLB, MSA is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain, and SNCA mutations may play a role in the development of this disease as well.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, there is no cure for PD, DLB, or MSA, and treatment options are primarily limited to symptomatic management.
- Several drugs targeting alpha-synuclein are in development, including vaccines and antibodies designed to clear protein aggregates from the brain. 
- The prognosis for patients with SNCA mutations is generally worse than for patients with sporadic cases of PD or DLB.

## Drug response

- A variety of drugs have been developed to treat PD and related disorders and are typically prescribed according to the symptoms of the patient.
- The efficacy of these drugs can vary greatly depending on genotype, however, and patients with SNCA mutations may respond less well to standard treatments.
