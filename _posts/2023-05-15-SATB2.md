# Gene SATB2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2q33.1

## Pathology
- SATB2 gene mutations have been linked to intellectual disability, developmental delay, cleft palate, and speech and language disorders. 
- SATB2-associated syndrome (SAS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple parts of the body.

## Function
- The SATB2 protein plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and postnatal life.
