### Gene: ELANE

#### Genetic Position
The ELANE gene is located on chromosome 19q13.3.

#### Pathology
Mutations in the ELANE gene are associated with various neutropenia syndromes, such as cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia.

#### Function
ELANE encodes a protein called neutrophil elastase (NE), which is a serine protease that is primarily expressed in neutrophil granulocytes. NE plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by breaking down proteins in bacterial and fungal cell walls.

#### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: HGNC:3347
- NCBI Entrez: 1991
- Ensembl: ENSG00000127481
- OMIM: 130130
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08246

Aliases include:

- ELA2
- ELANE1
- HLE
- PMN-Elastase

#### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations have been described in the ELANE gene. Some common mutations and their dbSNP IDs include:

- p.Pro189Leu (rs387906787)
- p.Ser97Phe (rs28929474)
- p.Arg172Gln (rs137852670)

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the ELANE gene, including SNVs and InDels. However, these mutations are rare and not well characterized.

#### Related Disease
Mutations in the ELANE gene are associated with various neutropenia syndromes, such as cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia. These conditions are characterized by recurrent and severe bacterial infections due to a deficiency in neutrophil granulocytes.

#### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for neutropenia syndromes caused by ELANE mutations typically involves administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which stimulates the production of neutrophils. Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and severity of the disease.

#### Drug Response
There is some evidence to suggest that individuals with certain ELANE mutations may respond differently to G-CSF therapy, but further research is needed to confirm this.
