## Gene ALK

### General Information
- Function for Gene: ALK receptor tyrosine kinase
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 2 (2p23.2)
- External IDs for Gene: HGNC: 427, Entrez Gene: 238, Ensembl: ENSG00000171094, OMIM: 105590, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UM73
- Aliases: ALK, CD246, NBLST3

### Mutations and Variations
- AA Mutation List: The ALK gene has several mutations reported in the literature. Some of the frequently occurring mutations are F1174L, R1275Q, I1171T, and C1156Y.
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs121434568, rs121434569, rs121434570, rs200681176

### Somatic Variants
- Somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in several cancers including neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
- dbSNP ID: rs200969037, rs200979986, rs200749065, rs200971049

### Related Diseases
- ALK gene mutations are associated with several types of cancers, mainly neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma.
  
### Treatment and Prognosis
- Crizotinib is an ALK inhibitor that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. It has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of some types of neuroblastoma.
- Patients with ALK-positive neuroblastoma have a worse prognosis than those with ALK-negative neuroblastoma.

### Drug Response
- The drug response to ALK inhibitors can vary depending on the type of mutation present in the gene.
