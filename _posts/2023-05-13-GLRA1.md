# Gene GLRA1

## Genetic Position
The GLRA1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q33.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in GLRA1 are associated with hyperekplexia, a rare neurological disorder characterized by excessive startle responses.

## Function
The GLRA1 gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the glycine receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel that is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported for this gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in GLRA1 are associated with hyperekplexia, a rare neurological disorder characterized by exaggerated startle reflexes, muscle stiffness, and falls. In severe cases, the disorder can lead to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for hyperekplexia, but symptoms can be managed with medications that enhance the activity of the glycine receptor. Prognosis for individuals with hyperekplexia is generally good with appropriate treatment.

## Drug Response
In some cases, individuals with hyperekplexia may be responsive to treatment with benzodiazepines or other drugs that enhance the activity of the glycine receptor.
