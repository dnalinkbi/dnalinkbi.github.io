# Gene CCM2

### Genomic Location, Pathology, and Function

- **Genomic location**: Gene CCM2 is located on Chromosome 7 in humans. The genomic coordinates of the CCM2 gene are 7p13-p12.1.
- **Pathology**: Mutation in CCM2 has been implicated in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs), which are vascular abnormalities that affect the brain and spinal cord. 
- **Function**: The CCM2 gene is involved in maintaining proper endothelial cell function and vascular integrity by regulating signaling pathways such as the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Sites

- **External IDs**: CCM2 gene has the following external IDs: 

| Gene ID        | Ensembl Gene ID     | Entrez Gene ID |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| HGNC:18797    | ENSG00000106355 | 83605             |

- **Aliases**: CCM2 is also known by the following names:

        - Malcavernin
        - OSM

### AA Mutation List, Mutation Type, and dbSNP ID

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type**: There are multiple missense and nonsense mutations reported in the CCM2 gene that are associated with CCM disease. Some notable mutations are:

| Mutation Type | Mutation | dbSNP ID |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Missense       | p.Arg185Pro| rs28933377 |
| Missense       | p.Arg231Pro | rs28933378 |
| Nonsense       | Gln80Ter  | rs137852689 |
| Missense       | Pro14Ser  | rs140177963 |

- **dbSNP ID**: dbSNP IDs are assigned to variations in the human genome and are used as a reference for genetic polymorphisms, mutation history, and genotype-phenotype associations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID

There have been somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the CCM2 gene that are associated with CCM disease. However, there are no dbSNP IDs associated with these variations.

### Related Disease

The CCM2 gene mutations have been identified in various CCM-affected families, making it a genetic risk factor for Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs).

### Treatment and Prognosis

The treatments for CCMs primarily involve surgical interventions and symptomatic management. The prognosis depends on the size, location, and number of CCM lesions, and the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response

There is no specific drug therapy established for the treatment of CCMs. However, some drugs show promise in the preclinical stage, including statins, Sirolimus, and beta-blockers.
