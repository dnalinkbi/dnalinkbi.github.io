## Gene GLIS2

### Genetic Position
The GLIS2 gene is located on chromosome 16 (16p13.3) with genomic coordinates of 3,260,114-3,482,272.

### Pathology and Function
The GLIS2 gene encodes a transcriptional activator protein that is involved in the development and differentiation of various organs. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. GLIS2 mutations have been linked to several diseases, including diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism.
