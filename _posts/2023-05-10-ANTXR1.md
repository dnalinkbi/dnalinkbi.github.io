# Information about gene ANTXR1

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- ANTXR1 gene is located on chromosome 2p13.3.
- It encodes a transmembrane protein called anthrax toxin receptor 1.
- ANTXR1 is associated with anthrax infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis.
- Mutations in ANTXR1 have been linked to systemic sclerosis and susceptibility to anthrax infection.

## Function

The ANTXR1 protein functions as a cellular receptor for protective antigen (PA), a component of the anthrax toxin. It binds to PA and mediates its internalization into the cell. Once inside, PA facilitates the delivery of the toxic components of anthrax into the cytoplasm of the infected cell, leading to cell death.

## Related Disease

- Systemic sclerosis - ANTXR1 is associated with susceptibility to systemic sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs.
- Anthrax infection - ANTXR1 is the receptor for the anthrax toxin and mutations in the gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to infection.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for anthrax infection, but early treatment with antibiotics can be effective. Vaccines are also available for those at high risk of exposure.
- Systemic sclerosis treatment is symptomatic and may include immunosuppressive drugs, skin protection, and physical therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and its complications.

## Drug Response

- ANTXR1 is a potential therapeutic target for anthrax infection.
- The anthrax toxin can also be targeted with monoclonal antibodies such as raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab, which have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of anthrax.
