## Gene Information

### Gene Name
ATP2A1

### Function for Gene
The ATP2A1 gene encodes a protein called SERCA1, which is responsible for transport of calcium ions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscles during muscle relaxation.

### External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
- HGNC ID: 857
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 487
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000101200
- OMIM ID: 108740
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q14315
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 16 (16p11.2)

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg492His (rs121918003)
- p.Arg489Trp (rs28929474)
- p.Ala373Val (rs370556363)
- p.Arg482Gln (rs61920677)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the ATP2A1 gene.

### Related Disease
- Brody myopathy (BM): Brody myopathy is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP2A1 gene. Symptoms include muscle cramp during exercise, muscle stiffness after exercise, muscle weakness and muscle wasting.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Brody myopathy currently, but the symptoms can be managed with medication. The prognosis is dependent on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response data for ATP2A1.
