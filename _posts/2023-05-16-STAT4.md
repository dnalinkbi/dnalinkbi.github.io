# Gene STAT4

- **Function for gene**: The STAT4 gene is involved in the regulation of immune responses and plays a key role in the development of Th1 cells and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) in response to microbial pathogens.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**:
    - Gene ID: 6775
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 2p25.1
    - Aliases: SLEB11, STAT4B, STAT4S, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4

- **External sites**:
    - HGNC: 11304
    - NCBI Entrez: 6775
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000168878
    - OMIM: 600558
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14847

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Currently, there are 106 missense mutations reported in the STAT4 gene according to the NCBI ClinVar database. Some of the missense mutations with dbSNP ID are:
    - rs3734390: p.Val14Ile
    - rs7574865: p.Ala183Thr
    - rs3814627: p.Gly244Arg

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are 27 somatic variations (SNVs/InDels) reported in the STAT4 gene according to the COSMIC database. Some of the somatic variations with dbSNP ID are:
    - rs786899093: p.Glu488del
    - rs1057519813: p.Val648_Asp657del

- **Related disease**: Defects in the STAT4 gene are associated with susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS).

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment options for patients with autoimmune diseases involving the STAT4 gene include immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, methotrexate, and biological therapies like anti-TNF and anti-IL-6. Prognosis can vary depending on the individual and severity of the disease.

- **Drug response**: Some studies have suggested that the STAT4 gene may be an important target for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune diseases, and multiple small molecules targeting STAT4 have been developed.
