## Gene Information for PTPRQ

### Gene Function
PTPRQ (Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Q) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which are involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. PTPRQ is specifically expressed in the inner ear and is important for the development and maintenance of hearing and balance.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 12q15
- HGNC ID: HGNC:15362
- NCBI Entrez ID: 374462
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163627
- OMIM ID: 603317
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9Y657

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported amino acid (AA) mutations in PTPRQ:
- p.Gly363Ser (rs750726186)
- p.Arg90Gln (rs76295586)
- p.Pro896Leu (rs142016137)
- p.Thr1202Met (rs145592774)

These mutations are all missense mutations, which means that a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for PTPRQ.

### Related Disease
Mutations in PTPRQ have been linked to autosomal recessive deafness, with several reported cases of individuals with mutations in this gene exhibiting hearing loss.

### Treatment and Prognosis
At present, there is no specific treatment for genetic hearing loss due to PTPRQ mutations. Treatment options are generally focused on managing the symptoms associated with hearing loss.

### Drug Response
Currently, there is no known drug response associated with PTPRQ mutations.
