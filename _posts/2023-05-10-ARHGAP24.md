# Information about gene ARHGAP24

## Genetic Position

- ARHGAP24 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 at position 25.1.

## Pathology

- Mutations in the ARHGAP24 gene have been associated with several diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders and cardiac diseases.

## Function

- ARHGAP24 encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Rho family of small GTPases. It negatively regulates Rho GTPases, which are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell motility, and gene expression.
