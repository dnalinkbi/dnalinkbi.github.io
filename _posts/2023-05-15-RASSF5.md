# Information about gene RASSF5

## Genetic Position 
The gene RASSF5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q32.1.

## Pathology
Studies have shown the involvement of RASSF5 in many types of cancer including glioma, breast, colon, and lung cancer.
The downregulation of RASSF5 has been linked to tumor progression, invasion and decreased survival rates in cancer patients.

## Function 
RAS association domain family member 5 (RASSF5) protein is a member of the RASSF family and acts as a tumor suppressor.
It is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and microtubule dynamics. It plays a significant role in mitosis and cytokinesis by controlling the localization of the Aurora B kinase.

|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|Cancer Type|
|----|----|----|
|SNV|rs121913512|Colorectal Cancer|
|SNV|rs147361756|Glioblastoma Multiforme|
|InDel|rs886044163|Breast Cancer|

## Related Disease
The literature has reported an association of the RASSF5 gene with various types of cancer, including glioma, breast, colon, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Studies have shown promising results in terms of treatment response and prognosis for cancer patients with restored RASSF5 expression.
Furthermore, some studies have reported that RASSF5 could be a potential therapeutic target for cancers.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug specific to RASSF5, but studies suggest that its re-expression sensitizes tumors to common chemotherapy drugs and inhibits cell proliferation.
