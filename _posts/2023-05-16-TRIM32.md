# Genetic information on gene TRIM32

## Gene Information
- **Gene Symbol:** TRIM32
- **Aliases:** HJB12, LGMD2H
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 9q33.1

## Function 
The TRIM32 gene encodes for a tripartite motif (TRIM) protein that plays a role in protein degradation pathways via ubiquitination. It is also involved in skeletal muscle development and the maintenance of normal muscle structure. Mutations in the TRIM32 gene have been identified as a cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H).

## Related Diseases
- Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2H (LGMD2H)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for LGMD2H. Treatment mainly involves managing symptoms and preventing complications. Prognosis is typically poor, as the disease progresses over time and can lead to significant disability.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug therapy specific to LGMD2H.
