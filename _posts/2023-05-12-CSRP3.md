# Information about gene CSRP3

## Overview
CSRP3 (cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3), also known as MLP (muscle LIM protein), is a gene located on chromosome 11q12.3 that encodes a protein that belongs to the LIM/double zinc finger protein family. This protein is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and plays a crucial role in regulating the assembly and function of the Z-disk in sarcomeres.

## Function
The CSRP3 gene encodes MLP, which is involved in the formation and maintenance of muscle fibers by interacting with different proteins, including actin filaments, titin, and myopalladin. Its function is to maintain the structural integrity of the muscle and regulate myofibrillogenesis.

## Related disease
Mutations in the CSRP3 gene are associated with various forms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which are inherited disorders characterized by weakened heart muscle and an enlarged heart.

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options for DCM and HCM may include medications, lifestyle modifications, and/or surgery depending on the severity of the condition and the individual patient's needs. Prognosis for patients with these conditions can vary depending on the extent of damage to the heart muscle and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug response
There is limited information available regarding drug response related to CSRP3 mutations.
