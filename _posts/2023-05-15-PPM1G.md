# Information about gene PPM1G

## Genetic position
The gene PPM1G is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 34.3 (1q34.3).

## Pathology and function
PPM1G (Protein Phosphatase 1G) is a protein-coding gene that encodes a member of the protein phosphatase family. It is involved in dephosphorylation of proteins, which is a process that plays a key role in various cellular signaling pathways such as cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis.

Studies have shown that PPM1G is often dysregulated in various types of cancers such as breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancers. Dysregulation of PPM1G has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Related disease
Studies have associated dysregulation of PPM1G with various types of cancers such as breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancers.

## Treatment and prognosis
PPM1G is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target for various types of cancers. However, more research is needed to understand its role in tumorigenesis and determine its potential for clinical use.

## Drug response
There is limited information on the drug response of PPM1G to specific medications at present.
