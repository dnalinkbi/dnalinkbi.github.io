# Gene CDON information

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
**Genetic position**: CDON is located on chromosome 11q24.2.

**Pathology**: Mutations in CDON have been linked to dextro-looped transposition of the great arteries (DTGA), a congenital heart defect where the aorta exits from the right ventricle of the heart instead of the left ventricle as it should be.

**Function**: CDON is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in the development of the heart and central nervous system. It acts as a co-receptor for the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is important in embryonic development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic mutations reported for CDON in COSMIC.

## Related disease
Mutations in CDON have been linked to dextro-looped transposition of the great arteries (DTGA), a congenital heart defect. 

## Treatment and prognosis
DTGA is usually treated by surgery soon after birth and the long-term prognosis is generally good.

## Drug response
There are no FDA-approved drugs specific to CDON currently available in the market.
