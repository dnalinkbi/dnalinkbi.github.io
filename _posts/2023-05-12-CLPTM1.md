## Gene CLPTM1

### Genetic Position
CLPTM1 gene is located at chromosome 5 (5p15.33-p15.2) and it spans about 34.2 kb.

### Pathology
CLPTM1 gene is known to be associated with different types of cancers such as lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer. This gene is overexpressed in cancer cells and its overexpression is usually associated with poor prognosis in certain types of cancer.

### Function
CLPTM1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival. It has been suggested that CLPTM1 may be involved in DNA damage response pathways and it may play a role in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Additionally, this gene may have a role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations documented in the CLPTM1 gene, such as rs4986791 (p.Ser66Tyr) and rs35285752 (p.Pro194Ser).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations documented in the CLPTM1 gene associated with different types of cancers. For example, in pancreatic cancer, the rs114903434 (p.Glu5Lys) mutation has been found.

### Related Diseases
CLPTM1 gene has been associated with different types of cancers such as lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The overexpression of the CLPTM1 gene in cancer cells has been used as a prognostic biomarker for certain types of cancer.

### Drug Response
There are no drugs specifically targeting CLPTM1 gene at present.
