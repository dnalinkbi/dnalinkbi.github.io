# Gene: LRP1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 12, q13.3

**Pathology:**
- LRP1 gene is involved in various diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.
- It is associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
- It plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism, amyloid-beta protein clearance, and the internalization of various ligands.

**Function for Gene:**
- LRP1 gene encodes for a transmembrane receptor protein called low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1).
- It is involved in endocytosis, cellular signaling, and lipid metabolism.
- LRP1 is widely expressed in various tissues, especially in the liver, brain, and kidney.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 6703
- NCBI Entrez: 4035
- Ensembl: ENSG00000132341
- OMIM: 107770
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q07954

**Aliases:**
- A2MR, APR, CD91, LRP, TGFBR5

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- rs11546599 (p.Arg1313Leu) - missense mutation
- rs1800194 (p.Asn2214Ser) - missense mutation
- rs1799986 (p.Leu2412Phe) - missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs12377632
- rs11753641

**Related Disease:**
- Late-onset Alzheimer's disease
- Atherosclerosis
- Cancer

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
- There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but symptomatic treatments are available to improve the quality of life of patients.
- Treatments for atherosclerosis include lifestyle changes, medications, and surgical interventions.
- Cancer treatment depends on the type and stage of the cancer.

**Drug Response:**
- A study suggests that a beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide-lowering drug, AZD3293, that targets BACE 1 may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease by lowering Abeta levels. 
- A drug called LRP1-agonist, RAP, is being tested as a potential therapy for atherosclerosis.
