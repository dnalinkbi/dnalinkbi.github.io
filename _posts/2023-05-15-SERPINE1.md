# Gene Information on SERPINE1

## Overview
SERPINE1 is a gene that encodes for a serine protease inhibitor, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21.3) and is highly expressed in endothelial cells.

## Function for gene
SERPINE1 inhibits the activity of the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which are responsible for converting plasminogen into plasmin. Plasmin is involved in the breakdown of blood clots, and therefore, SERPINE1 acts as a potent regulator of fibrinolysis.

## Related Disease
Dysregulation of SERPINE1 has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions, including thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
SERPINE1 inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of thrombosis and other conditions where fibrinolysis needs to be promoted. In cancer, high levels of SERPINE1 expression are often associated with a poor prognosis due to its role in tumor invasion and metastasis.

## Drug Response
SERPINE1 inhibitors, such as t-PA, have been found to be effective in the treatment of thrombosis. However, these inhibitors can also increase the risk of bleeding.
