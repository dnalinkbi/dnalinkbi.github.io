## CD3G Gene

- **Function**: The CD3G gene is involved in the assembly, stability, and signal transduction of the T cell receptor complex.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location**:
    - HGNC ID: 1675
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 917
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000109063
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q23.3

- **Aliases**: T3G, CD3-7, CD3G1, CD3gamma, FLJ18683, IMD18, T3G-TDU

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: There are several non-synonymous mutations reported in the CD3G gene, including R30W, G105R, R137H, and P214S. These mutations are reported in dbSNP with the following IDs: rs7102, rs2229177, rs148890487, and rs143221283, respectively.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are several somatic mutations reported in the CD3G gene in various cancer types. These mutations are reported in dbSNP with the following IDs: rs143221283, rs148890487, rs201242028, rs200423970, and rs201821065.

- **Related Disease**: The CD3G gene mutations have been associated with various diseases, including immunodeficiency 18 (IMD18), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.

- **Treatment and Prognosis**: The treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease associated with CD3G gene mutations. For example, stem cell transplantation has been used to treat SCID.

- **Drug Response**: There is no information available about drug response specifically related to CD3G gene mutations.
