# Gene C3

## Genetic Position 
The C3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.3) and spans 41.1 kilobases.

## Pathology
The C3 gene encodes the complement component C3, which plays a critical role in the innate immune response. Dysregulation of the C3 gene has been linked to several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, glomerulonephritis, and age-related macular degeneration.

## Function
The complement component C3 is a central component of the complement system, an integral part of the innate immune response. It plays a crucial role in opsonization, chemotaxis, and membrane attack complex formation, leading to the clearance of pathogens and other harmful agents from the body.

## Related Disease
Aberration in the C3 gene has been linked to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as: 
- Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- Dense Deposit Disease
- C3 Glomerulopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis
The management of C3-linked autoimmune and inflammatory disorders typically involves the use of immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid, and rituximab. However, the treatment and prognosis for these diseases are highly variable and depend on several factors, including the age of the patient, the severity of the condition, the extent of organ damage, and the presence of comorbidities.

## Drug Response
Several studies have reported variability in the response to immunosuppressive therapy among patients with C3-linked autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Further research is needed to identify biomarkers that could predict drug response and facilitate personalized treatment strategies.
