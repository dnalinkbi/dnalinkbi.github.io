## Gene: GCSH
### Genetic Position:
- Chromosomal Location: 16q23.1 
- Genomic Coordinate: 76494018-76520726

### Pathology:
The mutations in the GCSH gene have been linked with a deficiency in glycine cleavage enzyme system. This condition results in a buildup of glycine in tissues and body fluids, which can cause seizures, intellectual disability, breathing problems, and even death.

### Function:
The GCSH gene encodes an enzyme called glycine cleavage system protein H (GCSH), which is part of the glycine cleavage enzyme system. This system is involved in breaking down glycine, an important amino acid, into smaller components that the body can use for energy.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 4220
- NCBI Entrez: 2653
- Ensembl: ENSG00000167207
- OMIM: 238300
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23434
- Aliases: AMBX1, GLDCAP

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg353His (rs121909277)
- p.Glu129Asp (rs267607098)
- p.Arg29Cys (rs281875749)
- p.Thr78Ala (rs546065480)
- p.Asp193Gly (rs777178471)
- p.Arg433Cys (rs267607096)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No significant somatic SNVs/InDels reported for GCSH.

### Related Disease:
- Glycine encephalopathy
- Hyperglycinemia

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for glycine encephalopathy or hyperglycinemia, but treatment options aim to manage symptoms. This includes medications to reduce glycine levels, seizure control, and supportive care.

### Drug Response:
There is currently no specific drug approved for GCSH deficiency, but several medications may help manage symptoms. These include sodium benzoate, phenobarbital, and dextromethorphan.
