## Gene NPC1L1
The NPC1L1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in absorbing cholesterol from food.

### Function
The NPC1L1 protein is located in the small intestine and facilitates the uptake of dietary cholesterol. It interacts with cholesterol in the intestinal lumen and transports it across the enterocyte membrane for absorption.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the NPC1L1 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the NPC1L1 gene have been associated with sitosterolemia, a rare inherited disorder characterized by an increased intestinal absorption and decreased biliary excretion of plant sterols and cholesterol. This leads to the accumulation of sterols in various tissues and can lead to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Management of sitosterolemia involves a diet low in plant sterols and cholesterol. Treatment with ezetimibe, which blocks the action of NPC1L1, has been effective in reducing plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol in affected individuals.

### Drug Response
Ezetimibe is an effective treatment for sitosterolemia, as it blocks the NPC1L1 protein and reduces cholesterol absorption.
