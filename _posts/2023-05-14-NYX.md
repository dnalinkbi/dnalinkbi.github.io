# Gene Information for NYX 

## General Information
- **Gene**: NYX (nyctalopin) 
- **Genomic Location**: Xp11.4 
- **Aliases**: Nachtblindheit protein (NYP), Congenital stationary night blindness 1F (CSNB1F) 

## Function for the Gene
- The NYX gene provides instructions for making a protein called nyctalopin which is necessary for normal vision. 
- Nyctalopin is found in the retina, a layer of cells at the back of the eye that processes incoming light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. 
- The protein may help regulate the activity of certain cells in the retina, including a type of cell called a bipolar cell which serves as an intermediary between the light-sensitive cells and the optic nerve. 

## External IDs for the Gene and Genomic Location
- **HGNC ID**: 17022
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID**: 60598
- **Ensembl Gene ID**: ENSG00000168496
- **OMIM ID**: 300278
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID**: Q9H2S2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several known mutations in the NYX gene that are associated with Congenital stationary night blindness type 1F (CSNB1F). 
- Here are some of the amino acid mutations with the corresponding dbSNP ID (if available):
    - N9K (rs121908172)
    - P18L (rs121908174)
    - Q45X (rs121908177)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are currently no known somatic mutations in the NYX gene with a dbSNP ID. 

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in the NYX gene are associated with Congenital stationary night blindness type 1F (CSNB1F), which is a rare, non-progressive disorder characterized by night blindness, decreased visual acuity, and other vision problems. 
- CSNB1F is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means that the condition is more common in males than in females.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for Congenital stationary night blindness type 1F (CSNB1F). 
- Treatment mainly involves managing the symptoms and providing appropriate visual aids to improve vision. 
- The prognosis for individuals with CSNB1F depends on the severity of the condition and individual factors. 

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug therapy for the treatment of Congenital stationary night blindness type 1F (CSNB1F). 
- However, research is ongoing to develop new treatments and therapies that may target the underlying genetic abnormalities associated with the condition.
