## Gene: CYBRD1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2q31.1
- Locus: NG_032119.1
- Gene ID: 114907
- Genomic Location: chr2:175,254,715-175,299,174

### Pathology and Function
- CYBRD1 is involved in the uptake and transport of iron in the body.
- This gene encodes for a heme-containing membrane transporter that regulates non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) uptake and NTBI-associated oxidative stress.
- Mutations in CYBRD1 have been associated with several iron-related diseases, including hemochromatosis and anemia of inflammation.

- None reported

### Related Diseases
- Hemochromatosis type 3 (OMIM: 604250)
- Anemia of inflammation (OMIM: 206200)
- Microcytic anemia (OMIM: 206200)
- Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) (OMIM: 206200)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for iron-related diseases associated with CYBRD1 mutations may involve iron chelation therapy, phlebotomy, or other methods to manage iron levels in the body.
- The prognosis for patients with CYBRD1-related diseases may depend on the severity of the disease and treatment response.

### Drug Response
- Some iron chelation therapies that may be used to treat iron-related diseases, such as deferasirox (Exjade) and deferiprone (Ferriprox), target iron overload by binding to iron and promoting its excretion from the body.
