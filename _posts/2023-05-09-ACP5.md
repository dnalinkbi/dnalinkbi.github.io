## Gene ACP5

### Gene Position

- The ACP5 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

### Gene Function

- The ACP5 gene encodes an enzyme called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), which is involved in bone resorption by osteoclasts.

### Related Diseases

- Mutations in the ACP5 gene have been associated with diseases such as spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI).

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no known cure for SPENCDI, and treatment is mainly supportive.

### Drug Response
