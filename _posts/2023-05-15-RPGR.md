# Gene RPGR

## Genetic Position
The gene RPGR (Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator) is located at chromosome Xq26.2.

## Pathology
RPGR mutations are associated with a wide range of retinal degenerative diseases, collectively known as RPGR-associated retinopathy (RPGR-RP).

## Function
The RPGR gene encodes a protein that acts as a regulator of intracellular transport processes in the retina cells. Specifically, RPGR is involved in the proper localization and function of photoreceptor cells, which are responsible for detecting visual stimuli. Mutations in the RPGR gene lead to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells and subsequent vision loss.

None reported in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases
RPGR mutations are associated with various forms of inherited retinal disease, including X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for RPGR-RP. Treatment options are limited to supportive measures such as low vision aids and lifestyle modifications. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is no targeted therapy available specifically for RPGR-RP. However, some treatments being studied for retinal degenerative diseases in general may also be of benefit to RPGR-RP patients, such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy.
