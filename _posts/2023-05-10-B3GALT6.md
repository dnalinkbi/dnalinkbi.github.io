# Information about Gene B3GALT6 

## Genetic position 

B3GALT6 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 1q41. It spans 45,593 base pairs and consists of 9 exons. 

## Pathology 

Mutations in the B3GALT6 gene have been linked to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type 2 (EDS-PGD2), a rare condition characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and premature aging. 

## Function 

B3GALT6 encodes the beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 6 enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of the carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to substrates containing GlcNAc(beta1-3)Gal sequences.
