# Information about gene MFAP4

## Genetic position
The gene MFAP4 is located on chromosome 17q25.3, from base pair 75,460,887 to 75,475,518.

## Pathology
MFAP4 has been associated with several diseases, such as:
- Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV
- Hereditary pulmonary fibrosis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic sclerosis

## Function
The MFAP4 gene encodes a protein called microfibrillar-associated protein 4, which is a component of elastic fibers and extracellular matrix. It has been suggested that MFAP4 has a role in the regulation of elastic fiber assembly and in tissue repair.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 28790
- NCBI Entrez: 79718
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169629
- OMIM: 608174
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96JB5
- Aliases: MAGP-2, MFAP-4, MP4

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
According to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, there are several point mutations that have been reported in the MFAP4 gene:
- Cys-57: cysteine is replaced by arginine
- Gln-326: glutamine is replaced by lysine
- Ala-335: alanine is replaced by proline

These mutations have been associated with osteogenesis imperfecta type IV and hereditary pulmonary fibrosis. There are no dbSNP IDs currently available for these mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported on the MFAP4 gene in COSMIC database:
- c.1091C>T, p.Gln364Ter, COSM1362129
- c.1127_1131delTTTAA, p.Phe376Serfs*6, COSM1362157
- c.255C>T, p.Arg85Ter, COSM1362182
- c.741C>T, p.Gln247Ter, COSM1362128

## Related disease
Some of the diseases related to mutations in MFAP4 gene are:
- Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV
- Hereditary pulmonary fibrosis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic sclerosis

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no specific treatment for mutations in MFAP4 gene. Management of related diseases is usually symptomatic and supportive.

## Drug response
No specific drugs have been identified as having a significant response to mutations in the MFAP4 gene.
