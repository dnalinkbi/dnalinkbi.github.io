## Gene BRD3

### Genetic Position

The BRD3 gene is located on Chromosome 9 at the position 9p21.1.

### Pathology

Mutations in the BRD3 gene have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders.

### Function

The BRD3 protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, specifically in the control of cell growth and division. It interacts with chromatin through its bromodomain, and is involved in the recruitment of transcription complexes to specific regions of DNA.

### External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC: 10660
- NCBI Entrez: 8019
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106824
- OMIM: 603508
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15059

Aliases: RING3, BR140, BRD3A, KIAA0043

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid mutations associated with the BRD3 gene, including:

- Pro329Arg (dbSNP ID: rs498872)
- Gly369Cys (dbSNP ID: rs35687150)
- Pro371Ser (dbSNP ID: rs35652593)
- His386Arg (dbSNP ID: rs141117422)

These mutations are missense mutations, meaning they result in a change to the amino acid sequence of the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variations) and InDels (Insertions and Deletions) associated with the BRD3 gene, including:

- c.2587A>G (dbSNP ID: rs398122987)
- c.1377C>T (dbSNP ID: rs754927007)
- c.1886C>T (dbSNP ID: rs774907593)

### Related Disease

Mutations in the BRD3 gene have been linked to several diseases, including:

- Cancer
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar Disorder
- ADHD

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for BRD3-related diseases. Prognosis may vary depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug response for BRD3-related diseases.
