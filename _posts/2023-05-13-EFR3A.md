# Information about gene EFR3A

**Genetic position**: EFR3A is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.11.

**Pathology**: Mutations in EFR3A gene have been associated with various human diseases including cancer.

**Function**: EFR3A encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the EFR3 family. It is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) activity, which is required for the synthesis of phosphoinositide lipids that play a crucial role in various cellular processes such as signaling, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization.
