# Gene: ACVR1

## Information

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Gene Function | ACVR1 belongs to the family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays a role in forming and maintaining bone and muscle tissues. |
| External IDs | Gene ID: 90, Locus: 2q24.1, Aliases: ACVRLK2. |
| External Sites | [HGNC]([Click](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:135),) [NCBI Entrez]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/90),) [Ensembl]([Click](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000109670;r=2:161,328,432-161,479,606),) [OMIM]([Click](https://www.omim.org/entry/102576),) [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot]([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04771).) |
| AA Mutations | R206H (rs121908367), G356D (rs121908368) |
| Mutation Type | Missense |
| Somatic SNVs/InDels | None reported in dbSNP |
| Related Diseases | Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, Heterotopic ossification |
| Treatment and Prognosis | There is no cure for Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, and treatment is mainly focused on relieving symptoms. Heterotopic ossification can be treated with surgery to remove the excess bone. |
| Drug Response | Studies suggest that existing drugs for related conditions may be effective in treating ACVR1-related diseases. For example, bisphosphonates, which are commonly used to treat osteoporosis, may potentially slow the progression of Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. |
