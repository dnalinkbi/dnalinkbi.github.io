## Gene Information: ADAM12

- **Function**: The ADAM12 gene encodes a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain-containing protein that has been implicated in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It is involved in several processes such as muscle regeneration, angiogenesis, and cancer progression.

- **External IDs**: The ADAM12 gene is located on chromosome 10 at the genomic location 10q26.3. It can also be referred to as:
    - HGNC: 239
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 8038
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000107564
    - OMIM: 602424
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43184
    
- **AA Mutation List**: Some of the amino acid mutations reported for ADAM12 with their corresponding mutation types and dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R398W | Missense | rs35818125 |
| H404R | Missense | rs41272294 |
| S613L | Missense | rs7682055 |
| T743I | Missense | rs2275837 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**: Some of the reported somatic SNVs/InDels for ADAM12 with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

| Variation | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- |
| c.1358_1359delAG | rs121912864 |
| c.2385G>A | rs553838142 |
| c.2380A>T | rs540091683 |

- **Related Diseases**: The dysregulation of ADAM12 has been associated with various diseases and conditions including:
    - Cancer (breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, etc.)
    - Muscular dystrophy
    - Arthritis
    - Adiposity
    - Pre-eclampsia
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: There is no known specific treatment for ADAM12-associated diseases. However, studies have suggested that inhibiting ADAM12 activity may have therapeutic potential in treating cancer and other conditions linked to the dysregulation of ADAM12.

- **Drug Response**: There is limited information available on drug response related to ADAM12. Some studies have reported that ADAM12 may be a potential target for anticancer therapy.
