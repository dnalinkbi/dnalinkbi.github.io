- **Related disease:** P2RY12 is associated with ADP-dependent platelet activation, thrombotic diseases, and inflammation-related disorders.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Antiplatelet drugs, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, are used in the treatment of thrombotic diseases associated with P2RY12. The prognosis depends on the severity and stage of the disease.

- **Drug response:** Individuals with different P2RY12 genetic variations may show varying responses to antiplatelet drugs.
