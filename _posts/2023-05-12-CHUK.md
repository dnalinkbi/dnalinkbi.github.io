## Gene: CHUK

Function:
- CHUK gene encodes for a protein called IκB kinase-alpha (IKK-α) that regulates inflammatory responses and cell survival.

External IDs and locations:
- HGNC ID: 1956
- NCBI Entrez ID: 1147
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000127914
- Genomic location: Chromosome 10 (10q24.32)
- Aliases: NFKBIKA, TCF16, IKK-alpha

AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.R65L (rs145360274): missense mutation
- p.Q421R (rs149944244): missense mutation
- p.H458Y (rs138205902): missense mutation

Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.371+1G>A (rs758350358): splicing mutation
- c.44_48delGAGAA (rs397507284): frameshift mutation

Related disease:
- Defects in CHUK gene have been associated with several diseases such as ectodermal dysplasia, with immunodeficiency (EDI), EDA-ID syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis.

Treatment and prognosis:
- Treatment options vary depending on the associated disease and can include anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory drugs, and antibiotics.
- Prognosis also depends on the specific disease and the severity of the associated symptoms.

Drug response:
- CHUK inhibitors such as BMS-345541 have been found to have potential therapeutic applications in cancer, inflammation, and other diseases.
