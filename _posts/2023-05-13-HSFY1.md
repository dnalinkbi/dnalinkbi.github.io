# Information about Gene HSFY1

## Genetic Position
Gene HSFY1, also known as Heat Shock Transcription Factor, Y-Linked 1, is located on Y chromosome at Yq11.223 (position: 24,490,466-24,492,691).

## Pathology and Function
The HSFY1 gene encodes a protein belonging to the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) family of transcription factors. The protein is selectively expressed in testis and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. It helps regulate the expression of genes involved in the development and maturation of sperm cells.
