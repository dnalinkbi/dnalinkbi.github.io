## GNPTAB Gene Information

### Genomic Position
The GNPTAB gene is located on chromosome 12q23.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the GNPTAB gene are associated with mucolipidosis II alpha/beta (also known as I-cell disease), a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by developmental delay, growth retardation, coarse facial features, and skeletal abnormalities.

### Function
The GNPTAB gene encodes the alpha and beta subunits of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, an enzyme required for the formation of mannose 6-phosphate recognition markers on lysosomal hydrolases. These recognition markers are necessary for proper targeting of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome.

### External IDs and Aliases
GNPTAB is also known as: 
- GNPTA 
- I-Cell Disease 
- Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta 
- NAGPA
- GNPTB

### AA Mutation List
Some of the reported amino acid mutations in GNPTAB associated with mucolipidosis II alpha/beta as reported in dbSNP:
- p.Arg68Cys (rs267606784)
- p.Val75GLeu (rs879253125)
- p.Gly1023Arg (rs267606785)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for GNPTAB.

### Related Diseases
GNPTAB mutations are associated with mucolipidosis II alpha/beta (I-cell disease) and mucolipidosis III alpha/beta.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for mucolipidosis II alpha/beta. Treatment is supportive and includes physical therapy, surgery for common orthopedic problems and pain relief. Prognosis is generally poor, with most affected individuals having a shortened lifespan.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug approved for the treatment of mucolipidosis II alpha/beta, although enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy are being investigated. Clinical trials of certain drugs such as cysteamine have shown promise in treating some symptoms associated with the condition.
