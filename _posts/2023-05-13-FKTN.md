# Information about gene FKTN

## Genetic Position

The FKTN gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q31.3) in humans.

## Pathology

Mutations in the FKTN gene are associated with various muscular dystrophies, including Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2M (LGMD2M), and congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C (MDC1C). These disorders are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.

## Function

The FKTN gene encodes a protein called fukutin, which plays a critical role in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (Î±-DG), a protein that is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic variations in the FKTN gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the FKTN gene are associated with various neuromuscular disorders, including Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2M (LGMD2M), and congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C (MDC1C).

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for neuromuscular disorders caused by mutations in the FKTN gene. Treatment options are limited to supportive care, such as physical therapy and respiratory support. The prognosis for these disorders can range from mild to severe.

## Drug Response

There are currently no approved drugs specifically for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders caused by mutations in the FKTN gene. However, clinical trials are underway to investigate the use of gene therapy and other potential treatments.
