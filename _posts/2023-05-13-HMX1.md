# Information about gene HMX1

## Genetic Position
The gene HMX1 is located on chromosome 4q26 and has a genomic location from 121,435,261 to 121,440,374 base pairs (GRCh38/hg38).

## Pathology 
Mutations or polymorphisms in the HMX1 gene have been associated with various developmental disorders such as hearing loss, cleft lip/palate and inner ear malformations. 

## Function
The HMX1 gene encodes for a transcription factor protein that plays a critical role in the development of inner ear and craniofacial structures during embryogenesis.
