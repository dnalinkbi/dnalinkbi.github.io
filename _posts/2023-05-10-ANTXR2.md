## Gene ANTXR2

### Genetic Position

The ANTXR2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q21.21).

### Pathology

Mutations in the ANTXR2 gene have been associated with susceptibility to several diseases, including:

- Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
- Infantile systemic hyalinosis
- Pre-eclampsia

### Function

The ANTXR2 protein is involved in cell-to-cell adhesion and signaling pathways, as well as the maintenance of extracellular matrix integrity.
