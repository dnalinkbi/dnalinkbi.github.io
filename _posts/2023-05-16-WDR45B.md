## Gene: WDR45B

### Pathology & Function 
WDR45B is associated with Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation 4 (NBIA4) which is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive dystonia, spasticity, parkinsonism, and iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. The exact mechanism of WDR45B in the development of this disease is still unclear. Nevertheless, WDR45B is believed to play a crucial role in the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is necessary for removing and recycling damaged proteins and other cellular waste products.
