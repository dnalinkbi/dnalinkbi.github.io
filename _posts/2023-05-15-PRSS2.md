## Gene PRSS2
### Genetic Position and Function
- PRSS2 gene is located on chromosome 7q34 and encodes for a serine protease called Trypsin-2.
- The Trypsin-2 enzyme is involved in the digestion and breakdown of proteins in the small intestine. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, specifically after the basic amino acids arginine and lysine.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- A list of somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the PRSS2 gene is not available as per the latest information.

### Related Disease
- Mutations in the PRSS2 gene have been linked to a rare inherited disorder called Hereditary Pancreatitis (HP).
- HP is a chronic inflammation of the pancreas that has a genetic basis. The mutations in the PRSS2 gene lead to the production of an overactive trypsin enzyme, which in turn causes inflammation and damage to the pancreas.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for HP, but symptomatic treatment can be given.
- Treatment usually involves pain relief, management of pancreatic enzyme levels, and lifestyle modifications such as avoiding alcohol and fatty foods.
- Individuals with HP may be at an increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer.

### Drug Response
- A list of drug responses related to the PRSS2 gene is not available as per the latest information.
