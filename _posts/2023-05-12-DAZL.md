## Information about Gene DAZL

### Genetic position

The DAZL (Deleted in AZoospermia Like) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q23) in humans.

### Pathology

Mutations in the DAZL gene have been associated with male infertility and premature ovarian failure in females.

### Function

The DAZL gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is involved in germ cell development. It plays a key role in the differentiation of germ cells into mature sperm and eggs.

### External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: 2700
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 1617
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000162688
- OMIM ID: 603354
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9Y6Y9
- Other aliases: DAZ, SPGYLA

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations that have been reported in the DAZL gene, including:

- p.Gly291Aspfs*37: frameshift mutation leading to a truncated protein (dbSNP ID: rs587784419)
- p.Cys358Arg: missense mutation causing a change in amino acid sequence (dbSNP ID: rs75315135)
- p.Arg323Cys: missense mutation causing a change in amino acid sequence (dbSNP ID: rs75315134)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic variants (SNVs/InDels) in the DAZL gene.

### Related disease

Mutations in the DAZL gene have been associated with male infertility and premature ovarian failure.

### Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for DAZL-related infertility or premature ovarian failure. However, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be effective for some patients.

### Drug response

There is currently no information about drug response related to DAZL mutations.
