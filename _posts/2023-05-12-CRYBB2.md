## Gene: CRYBB2

### Genetic Position:
Location: Chromosome 22 (22q11.23) \\
Strand: Plus \\
Genetic coordinates: 18,968,665-18,970,152

### Pathology:
CRYBB2 gene mutations have been associated with congenital cataracts, an inherited eye disease characterized by a clouding of the lens at birth or during early childhood.

### Function:
The CRYBB2 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the beta-crystallin family, which is one of the major structural proteins of the mammalian eye lens. The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the protein transparency and refractive index of the lens.

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 2396
- NCBI Entrez: 1415
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100341
- OMIM: 123620
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P43320

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- R77H (rs121912702) - missense mutation
- Phe71Leu (rs61742617) - missense mutation
- Ala2Val (rs121912701) - missense mutation

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No known somatic mutations in the CRYBB2 gene.

### Related Disease:
Congenital cataracts

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Surgical removal of the affected lens and implantation of an intraocular lens is the most effective treatment for congenital cataracts. The prognosis for those with cataracts is generally good if surgery is done promptly.

### Drug Response:
Currently, there are no drugs specifically indicated to treat congenital cataracts.
