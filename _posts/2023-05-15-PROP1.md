# Gene Information for PROP1

## Gene Function
PROP1 gene encodes a member of the paired-like homeobox family of transcription factors and plays an important role in the development of pituitary gland and hormone secretion. It acts as a transcriptional activator for hormone genes expression such as GH, PRL, and TSH.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID reported for PROP1 gene currently.

## Related Diseases
Variants in PROP1 gene can lead to combined pituitary hormone deficiency diseases (CPHD) such as a deficiency in growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for combined pituitary hormone deficiency focuses on hormone replacement therapy. It's a long-term treatment requiring lifelong medication. Prognosis is highly dependent on the severity of the hormone deficiency.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response reported specifically to the PROP1 gene.
