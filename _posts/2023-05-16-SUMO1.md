# Gene Information: SUMO1

## Genetic Position
SUMO1 is located on chromosome 2, specifically on the short arm at position 2p23.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in SUMO1 are associated with multiple diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Additionally, altered SUMOylation has been linked to cancer and various neurodegenerative disorders.

## Function
SUMO1 codes for a small ubiquitin-like modifier that is covalently attached to target proteins in a process called SUMOylation. This post-translational modification is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, and protein degradation.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment targeting SUMOylation. However, several drugs are being investigated for their potential to modulate the SUMOylation process. The prognosis varies depending on the underlying disease associated with the mutation.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to SUMOylation. However, some studies suggest that targeting SUMOylation may have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.
