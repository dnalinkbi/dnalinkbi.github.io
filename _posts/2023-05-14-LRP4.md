# Gene LRP4 

## Genetic Position:

LRP4 is located on chromosome 11 at the position q13.2. It spans approximately 149,963 base pairs of DNA.

## Pathology:

Mutations in the LRP4 gene have been identified in several diseases, including Cenani-Lenz syndrome. In addition, variants in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to several complex diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

## Function for Gene:

LRP4 is a transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor for several ligands, including agrin and Wnt proteins. It plays a key role in the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction, as well as in the regulation of bone density and metabolism.
