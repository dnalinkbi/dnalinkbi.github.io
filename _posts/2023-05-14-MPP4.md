### Gene Information Analysis Report: MPP4

#### Description
MPP4 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 4 at position 12.3. The gene product of MPP4 is a member of the p55-like MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) protein family. It encodes a protein which is abundant in retinal tissue and involved in cellular signaling, development of photoreceptor cells, and junctional complexes.

#### Function
MPP4 plays a role in the development of the retina and in the maintenance of its structure. It acts as a scaffolding protein that helps to anchor and organize signaling proteins at the membrane. It also binds to the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin and is required for its transport from the inner segment to the outer segment of rod photoreceptor cells. Additionally, MPP4 is associated with the molecular scaffold complexes that are important for the maintenance of tight junctions and adherence junctions, which help to maintain the static and dynamic properties of the retinal epithelium.

#### AA Mutation List with Mutation type and dbSNP ID
Three non-synonymous mutations have been reported for the MPP4 gene. They are as follows:

- P602L (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs955082985
- S296L (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs766680754
- V577M (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs980303856

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported yet for the MPP4 gene.

#### Related Disease
Mutations in MPP4 have been associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, which is a group of genetic disorders that cause the degeneration of the retina. Retinitis pigmentosa leads to progressive vision loss and sometimes blindness.

#### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but early diagnosis can help to slow down the progression of vision loss. Treatment options include medication, surgery, assistive devices, and therapy. The prognosis for retinitis pigmentosa varies depending on the severity and type of the disease.

#### Drug Response
There is no information available yet regarding drug response related to MPP4.
