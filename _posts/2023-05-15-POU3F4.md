## Information about gene POU3F4

### Genetics Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Position**: Chromosome Xq21.1
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the POU3F4 gene are associated with X-linked deafness 2 (DFNX2). 
- **Function**: The POU3F4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for hearing. This protein helps regulate the development and maintenance of the sensory cells (hair cells) in the inner ear that transmit sound to the brain.
