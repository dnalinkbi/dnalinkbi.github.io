## Gene: ARSA

ARSA (Arylsulfatase A) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13.33) and encodes for an enzyme called arylsulfatase A.

### Function
The arylsulfatase A enzyme is responsible for breaking down sulfatides, a type of fat molecule, in lysosomes. Any mutation in ARSA gene leads to a deficiency of this enzyme and inadequate breakdown of sulfatides, causing autosomal recessive metabolic disorder called metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Mutations in ARSA gene are known to cause MLD. Some common mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are listed below:

Mutation Type | AA Mutation | dbSNP ID
------------ | ------------| --------
Missense | p.Arg63Cys | rs121912788
Missense | p.Leu144Arg | rs121912786
Nonsense | p.Tyr295Term | rs121912874
Splice | c.822+1G>A | rs267607212

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in ARSA gene are not commonly reported in the literature.

### Related Disease
Mutations in ARSA gene cause metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) affecting the nervous system.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, no cure exists for MLD, and treatment is mainly supportive, aiming to manage symptoms and improve the quality of life. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potential cure option for some MLD patients but is associated with several complications.

### Drug Response
There are no approved drugs that treat MLD specifically. However, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is being investigated as a potential treatment method.
