## Information about gene CYBA

**Genetic position**: CYBA gene is located on chromosome 16q24.2.

**Function**: This gene encodes a protein called cytochrome b-245 alpha chain, which is a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. This complex plays a critical role in the innate immune system by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill invading pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. However, excessive production of ROS can cause damage to host tissues and contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases.

- HGNC: 2563
- NCBI Entrez: 1536 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000007908
- OMIM: 608508
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13498

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
- c.214A>G (p.Tyr72Cys), rs12003
- c.295G>A (p.Gly99Asp), rs6592
- c.419C>G (p.Arg140Gly), rs4673

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported yet.

**Related disease**: Mutations in CYBA gene have been associated with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder. This disease is characterized by recurrent infections, granuloma formation, and inflammation due to impaired ROS production by phagocytic cells.

**Treatment and prognosis**: The treatment for CGD primarily involves prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal agents, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy to prevent and manage infections. Currently, the only curative therapy for CGD is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, this procedure has potential risks and limitations, and its success depends on several factors, such as donor availability, conditioning regimen, and patient age and condition.

**Drug response**: No pharmacogenomic data is available yet for CYBA gene.
