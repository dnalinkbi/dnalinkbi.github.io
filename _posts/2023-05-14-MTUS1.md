# Gene Information for MTUS1

## Genetics Position
MTUS1 (Microtubule associated tumor suppressor 1) is located on chromosome 8q22.

## Pathology
MTUS1 plays a role in tumor suppression and has been linked to various types of cancer such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancer.

## Function
MTUS1 plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule stability and cell migration. It is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation.
