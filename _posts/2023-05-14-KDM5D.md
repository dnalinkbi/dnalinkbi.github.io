# Information about gene KDM5D

## Genetic Position 
- KDM5D gene is located on the Y chromosome at the position Yq11.223.

## Pathology 
- Loss or mutation of KDM5D gene is associated with the development of azoospermia and intellectual disability.

## Function for gene
- KDM5D gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of gene expression.
- It acts as a histone demethylase, which removes methyl groups from histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and is involved in transcriptional regulation.

## External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- Gene ID for KDM5D in HGNC is 6279.
- Genomic location of KDM5D is chrY: 23,086,386 - 23,109,273.
- Other aliases for KDM5D include JARID1D, SMCX, and TMS.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are several mutations in KDM5D gene that have been reported, including missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations.
- Some of the missense mutations reported for KDM5D gene are:
    - c.1829G>A (p.Arg610His) with dbSNP ID rs367543058
    - c.2405C>T (p.Arg802Cys) with dbSNP ID rs367543057
    - c.732G>C (p.Asp244His) with dbSNP ID rs202113366
- Frameshift mutations reported for KDM5D gene include:
    - c.674delC with dbSNP ID rs786201180

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in KDM5D gene.

## Related disease
- Mutations or loss of KDM5D gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and azoospermia.

## Treatment and prognosis
- There is no specific treatment or cure for KDM5D related disorders.
- Patients can seek genetic counseling to understand the cause and prognosis of the condition.

## Drug response
- There is no known drug that targets KDM5D gene.
- However, research is ongoing to develop drugs that can target histone demethylase enzymes, which may be beneficial in XLID and other related disorders.
