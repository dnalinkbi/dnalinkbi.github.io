# **Gene: SH3TC2**

## **Genetic Position**
- Chromosome: 5
- Location: 5q32
- Strand: -
- GRCh38 coordinates: NC_000005.10:g.150,218,169-150,314,926

## **Pathology & Function**
SH3TC2 is a gene encoding a protein that is important in Schwann cell function. Mutations in this gene are known to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a group of inherited nerve disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. 

### **Function for Gene**
SH3TC2 is responsible for encoding the SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats-containing protein 2, which plays an important role in the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, particularly Schwann cells. Schwann cells are responsible for producing the myelin sheath, a protective covering around the nerves that is important for the proper transmission of nerve impulses.

## **AA Mutation List**
- c.2374G>A: p.Arg792His (rs145032408)
- c.474G>A: p.Cys158Tyr (rs1436742625)
- c.339C>T: p.Ala113Val (rs143774794)
- c.2197C>T: p.Arg733Ter (rs151194184)

## **Mutation Type** 
The AA mutations mentioned above are all missense mutations. The c.2197C>T mutation is a nonsense mutation.

## **Somatic SNVs/InDels**
Currently there are no somatic mutations for SH3TC2 with dbSNP ID.

## **Related Diseases**
The mutations in SH3TC2 are known to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) which is a rare inherited disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. 

## **Treatment and Prognosis**
There is no known cure for CMT4C and treatment is mostly supportive. Physical therapy and assistive devices such as braces, walkers, and wheelchairs may help improve mobility. In some cases, surgery may be recommended to correct foot deformities or other skeletal issues. The prognosis for individuals with CMT4C varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## **Drug Response**
There is currently no known drug or targeted therapy for the treatment of CMT4C.
