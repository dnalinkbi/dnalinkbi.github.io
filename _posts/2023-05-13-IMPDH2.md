# Information about gene IMPDH2

## Genetic position:
- Gene name: IMPDH2 (Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2)
- Chromosome: 3
- Gene location: 3q27.2
- Strand: Plus
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38.p13): NC_000003.12:g.185,696,077-185,731,963

## Pathology:
IMPDH2 mutations have been associated with a range of diseases, including autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), and cancer.

## Function:
The protein encoded by IMPDH2 is a crucial enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP) and the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

## External IDs and aliases:
- HGNC ID: 5986
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 3615
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000167468
- OMIM ID: 601168
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P12268
- Aliases: IMPD2, IMPDH-II

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- c.457G>T (p.Glu153Ter) - frameshift/nonsense variant (rs12436809)
- c.789A>G (p.Asn263Ser) - missense variant (rs2274415)
- c.1508A>G (p.Tyr503Cys) - missense variant (rs2274487)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.224G>A (p.Val75Ile) - missense variant (rs267606696)
- c.1109G>A (p.Ser370Asn) - missense variant (rs469794652)
- c.1223G>A (p.Gly408Ser) - missense variant (rs398124803)

## Related diseases:
- Autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)
- Neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease)
- Cancer (leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer)

## Treatment and prognosis:
Treatment for diseases associated with IMPDH2 mutations varies depending on the specific disease. For cancer, IMPDH2 is a target for cancer therapies such as the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil. Prognosis also varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation.

## Drug response:
IMPDH2 inhibitors have shown potential for treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections.
