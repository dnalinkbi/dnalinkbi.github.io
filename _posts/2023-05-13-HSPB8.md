# Information about Gene HSPB8

## Genetic Position
Gene HSPB8 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 at position 12q24.23.

## Pathology and Function
HSPB8 (Heat Shock Protein Family B (Small) Member 8) is a member of the heat shock protein family and is known to play a role in protein folding and degradation. It has been suggested to have a protective function in neurons by regulating the clearance of protein aggregates. Mutations in the HSPB8 gene have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HSPB8 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy
- Neuropathy, Distal Hereditary Motor, Type IIA

## Treatment and Prognosis
While there is no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease or Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy, treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. This can include physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces or other orthotic devices, and medication for pain management.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that targets HSPB8. However, researchers are investigating the use of small molecule compounds that target HSPB8 for the treatment of protein aggregation diseases.
