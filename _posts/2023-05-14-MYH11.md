### Gene: MYH11

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 16 (16p13.11)

**Function for Gene:** MYH11 encodes for a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain protein that is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. It is specifically expressed in smooth muscle cells present in the walls of arteries and veins.

**External IDs and Aliases:**

- HGNC ID: 7587
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 4629
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000072182
- OMIM ID: 160745
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P35749

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several AA mutations reported in MYH11 gene, some of which are:

- R247C (rs145731073): missense mutation
- R702C (rs79624129): missense mutation
- E1845K (rs201530536): missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several somatic mutations reported in MYH11 gene, some of which are:

- c.4491G>A (rs367543973): missense mutation
- c.1229_1230insGGAT (rs876661223): frameshift mutation 

**Related Disease:** Mutations in MYH11 gene have been associated with various vascular disorders such as thoracic aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm, Moyamoya disease, and coronary artery disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for vascular disorders associated with MYH11 gene mutations may involve surgical intervention, such as aneurysm repair or angioplasty, and/or medical management with medications like beta blockers to control blood pressure. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the disease and response to treatment.

**Drug Response:** There is limited information available on drug response specific to MYH11 gene mutations.
