# Gene Information for ADSL

## Gene Function
The ADSL gene encodes for an enzyme that plays a role in the intermediary metabolism of purines. It converts adenylosuccinate to AMP and acts in the de novo purine synthesis pathway.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: 278
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 158
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000124463
- OMIM ID: 608222
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P30566
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 22q13.1

Aliases:
- Adenylosuccinate lyase
- ADSL1
- AdSL

## AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID
- p.Asp128Glu: Missense, rs760591657
- p.Arg426Ter: Nonsense, rs730880634
- p.Arg303Cys: Missense, rs796053854

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for ADSL in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Deficiencies in ADSL activity have been linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency (ADSLD). This disorder can cause developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and behavioral problems.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for ADSLD, but symptoms can be managed through medications such as levetiracetam and behavioral therapies. Prognosis for individuals with ADSLD can vary depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is evidence that individuals with ADSLD may respond positively to supplementation with creatine and guanidinoacetate, which can improve cognitive function.
