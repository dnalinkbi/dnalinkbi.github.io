### Gene Information
The gene HK1, also known as Hexokinase 1, is located on chromosome 10q22.1 and contains 17 exons. It encodes for the protein hexokinase-1 that catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism by phosphorylating glucose to form glucose-6-phosphate.

### Function for Gene
The function of the HK1 gene is important in the regulation of glucose metabolism, where the enzyme produced by the gene helps to maintain glucose homeostasis in cells. It also plays a role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation.
