# Gene NPY

## Information

* **Function for gene:** The NPY (neuropeptide Y) gene encodes a neuropeptide that is primarily involved in the regulation of food intake, energy homeostasis, and stress response. It also plays a role in several physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation, vascular growth, and immune modulation.

* **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    * Gene ID: 4852
    * Genomic location: Chromosome 7q36.1
    * Other aliases: NPY1, PYY, PP, NPY2, PYY3-36
    
* **External sites:**
    * HGNC: 8004
    * NCBI Entrez: 4852
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000175782
    * OMIM: 162640
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01303

* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    * rs16147: missense mutation - Gly7Ser
    * rs3037354: synonymous mutation - Ser74= 
    * rs16139: synonymous mutation - Cys12=
    * rs2910972: missense mutation - Arg7Gln

* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    * rs16131: frameshift deletion
    * rs104893905: missense mutation - Glu22Lys

* **Related disease:** The dysregulation of NPY has been linked to several diseases and disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, anxiety disorders, and epilepsy.

* **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no specific treatment for NPY-related disorders. However, several pharmacological agents are being developed that target NPY and its receptors to regulate food intake and reduce obesity.

* **Drug response:** Several drugs have been developed that target NPY and its receptors, including peptide agonists and antagonists, small molecule antagonists, and vaccines against NPY.
