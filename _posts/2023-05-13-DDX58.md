## Gene Information

### Gene: DDX58

- Function: This gene encodes a sensor of viral infection that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activates antiviral responses. Its activation leads to the production of interferon beta (IFNB), which in turn activates immune cells to clear the viral infection.

   - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000113721
   - OMIM ID: 609631
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9C0C4

- Genomic location:
   - Chromosome: 17
   - Start position: 7,753,571 bp
   - End position: 7,791,142 bp

- Aliases: RIG-I, D11Lgp1
