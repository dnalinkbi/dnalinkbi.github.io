## Information on Gene TSPEAR 

### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
TSPEAR (Thrombospondin-type1 domain-containing protein, synaptic protein) is located on chromosome 21q22.13 with a length of 121,645 base pairs. As a synaptic protein, it is highly expressed in the brain. The protein encoded by TSPEAR gene is important in synaptic plasticity and is suggested to play a role in early onset Alzheimer's disease.
