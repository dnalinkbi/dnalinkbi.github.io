# Gene CHST7

## Information

- **Pathology:** The CHST7 gene is associated with several diseases such as cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, and metabolic syndrome.
- **Function for Gene:** The CHST7 gene encodes a sulfotransferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to glycosaminoglycans. This process is important in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, which is involved in the formation of extracellular matrix and cartilage.

## Identifiers

- **Gene:** CHST7
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 16
- **Aliases:** C6ST1, C6ST-1, Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 7, Chondroitin 6-O-Sulfotransferase 1

## External Sites

- **HGNC:** HGNC:19059
- **NCBI Entrez:** 64374
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000140836
- **OMIM:** 605480
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q8NHU6
