# Gene Information Analysis: CFC1B

## Basic Information
CFC1B, also known as Cripto-1-FRL-1-Cryptic (CFC) family member 1B, is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 4q31.21. It has an external ID of HGNC:18041, NCBI Entrez: 283686, Ensembl: ENSG00000164046, OMIM: 611369, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96BZ9. CFC1B has an alias name of FRL-1B.

## Function for Gene
CFC1B is responsible for encoding a protein that acts as an activator of the TGF-beta pathway. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of embryonic development.
