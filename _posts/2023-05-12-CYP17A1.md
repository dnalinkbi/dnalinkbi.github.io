# Information about Gene CYP17A1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- Genetic Position: 10q24.32
- Pathology: CYP17A1 mutations are associated with 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (17OHD), which is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and sexual infantilism.
- Function: CYP17A1 encodes for the cytochrome P450 17A1 enzyme, which is responsible for two key steps in steroid hormone biosynthesis: (1) 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity, and (2) 17,20-lyase activity. These two activities are necessary for the production of androgens and estrogens.

## Related Disease
- 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (OMIM phenotype number: 609300)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: Hormone replacement therapy
- Prognosis: With timely diagnosis and proper treatment, individuals with 17OHD can lead normal, healthy lives.

## Drug Response
- Ketoconazole, a drug that inhibits steroidogenesis by blocking the CYP17A1 enzyme, has been used to treat 17OHD.
