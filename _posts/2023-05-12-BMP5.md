# Information about gene BMP5

## Genetic position

BMP5 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p12.1).

## Pathology

Mutations in BMP5 gene have been associated with several diseases, including osteoarthritis and various skeletal dysplasias. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in BMP5 gene has been linked to increased risk of osteoarthritis in Japanese population.

## Function

BMP5 gene encodes a protein called bone morphogenetic protein 5 (BMP5), which belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) family of proteins. BMP5 plays a crucial role in bone and cartilage development, as well as in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid mutations reported in BMP5 gene. Some of the notable ones include:

- R237K (rs3734440)
- S47C (rs201316174)
- G128S (rs61755902)

These mutations are mostly missense mutations, which alter the amino acid sequence of BMP5 protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in BMP5 gene, mostly in different types of cancers. Some of the notable ones include:

- c.607C>T (p.R203*)
- c.286_287del (p.Arg96Glyfs*25)
- c.234-4_234del (rs1554707728)

## Related disease

Mutations in BMP5 gene have been associated with the following diseases:

- Osteoarthritis
- Acromesomelic dysplasia, Hunter-Thompson type
- Brachydactyly, type C2

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for the diseases caused by BMP5 gene mutations. Treatment options are mostly supportive and aimed at managing the symptoms. The prognosis of these diseases depends on the severity of the symptoms and the specific type of mutation.

## Drug response

As of now, there is no known drug that specifically targets BMP5 gene or BMP5 protein.
