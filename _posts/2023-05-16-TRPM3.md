# Gene Information for TRPM3

## Genetic Position
TRPM3 is located on chromosome 9 at the position q21.13.

## Pathology 
Variants in TRPM3 have been associated with a range of disorders including epilepsy and chronic pain.

## Function
TRPM3 encodes for a calcium-permeable ion channel that plays a crucial role in several physiological processes including the detection of noxious heat and inflammatory pain.
