## Information about Gene CA2

### Genetic Position
- Gene: CA2
- Chromosome: 8
- Start Position: 116,497,070 bp
- End Position: 116,509,137 bp

### Pathology
- CA2 gene mutations have been linked to renal tubular acidosis (RTA), a condition characterized by an inability of the kidneys to remove acid from the body, leading to a buildup of acid in the blood and tissues.

### Function for gene
- The CA2 gene encodes for carbonic anhydrase II, an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate, which plays a crucial role in acid-base balance in various tissues including the kidney, lung, and brain.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- Gene ID: 760
- Genomic Location: NC_000008.11 (116,497,070-116,509,137)
- Other Aliases: CA-II, CAC, Car2

- c.607T>G (p.Cys203Gly) - rs121908775

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

### Related Disease
- Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment of RTA involves correcting the acid-base imbalance through medication and dietary changes.
- The prognosis for RTA varies depending on the underlying cause and severity, but with proper treatment, many individuals with RTA are able to lead relatively healthy lives.

### Drug response
- There is limited information available on drug response related to CA2 gene mutations.
