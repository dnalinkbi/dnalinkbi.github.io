# Gene BDNF

BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is a gene that encodes a neurotrophin protein that is primarily responsible for promoting the survival, development, and function of neurons in the central nervous system. BDNF has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as in the regulation of appetite and energy balance.

## External IDs and Genomic Location

- HGNC: 1037
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 627
- Ensembl: ENSG00000176697
- OMIM: 113505
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23560

BDNF is located on Chromosome 11 at the position 27,090,853-27,104,753 (GRCh38/hg38).

## AA Mutation List and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BDNF gene. Some of the most well-known include:

- rs6265 (Val66Met): A missense mutation that results in a valine to methionine substitution at position 66. This mutation has been associated with decreased BDNF secretion, altered synaptic plasticity, and increased susceptibility to various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
- rs7103411: An intronic SNP that has been linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions.
- rs12273539: A SNP located in the promoter region of BDNF that has been associated with decreased expression of the gene in the brain.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations in the BDNF gene that have been reported in various cancers, including brain tumors and colorectal cancer. However, few of these mutations have been well-characterized, and their functional significance remains unclear.

## Related Disease

BDNF has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for BDNF-related disorders, and treatment is primarily aimed at managing symptoms. However, research is ongoing to develop new targeted therapies that can modulate BDNF signaling and promote neuronal survival and function.

## Drug Response

There is some evidence to suggest that BDNF polymorphisms may influence individual responses to certain drugs, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. For example, individuals with the Val66Met mutation may exhibit decreased antidepressant response compared to those without the mutation.
