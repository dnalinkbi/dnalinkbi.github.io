# Information about Gene CC2D2A 

## Genetic Position
The CC2D2A gene is located on Chromosome 4 (4q28.2) in humans.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CC2D2A gene are associated with multiple congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (MCKDUT), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), and Joubert syndrome (JBTS). 

## Function for Gene
The CC2D2A gene encodes a protein called "coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 2A" which is involved in the development and function of cilia - hair-like structures that protrude from many cells in the human body.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the CC2D2A gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CC2D2A gene are associated with the following diseases:
- Multiple Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (MCKDUT)
- Meckel-Gruber Syndrome (MKS)
- Joubert Syndrome (JBTS)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MCKDUT, MKS, or JBTS. Treatment is based on the individual's specific symptoms and may include management of kidney dysfunction, breathing difficulties, and other complications associated with the conditions. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and specific symptoms of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information on drug response specific to mutations in the CC2D2A gene.
