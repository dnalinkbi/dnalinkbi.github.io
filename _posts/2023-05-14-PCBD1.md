## Gene: PCBD1

### Genetic Position
* Chromosome: 10
* Location: 10q22.1

### Pathology
PCBD1 gene mutations have been found to be associated with hyperphenylalaninemia, a rare inherited disorder where there is a build-up of phenylalanine in the body, leading to intellectual disability and other neurological problems.

### Function
The PCBD1 gene encodes the enzyme 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor for the hydroxylation of phenylalanine and other aromatic amino acids.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
* c.256C>T (p.Arg86Cys) - rs137853330
* c.257G>A (p.Arg86His) - rs137853331
* c.262A>G (p.Asn88Ser) - rs137853332

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic variants have been reported for this gene.

### Related Disease
* Hyperphenylalaninemia

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for hyperphenylalaninemia involves a low-phenylalanine diet and supplementation with tetrahydrobiopterin. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition and how early it is diagnosed and treated.

### Drug Response
There is limited information on the drug response to tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation.
