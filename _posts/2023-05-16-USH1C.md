# Info about Gene USH1C

## Gene Location and Aliases
- Gene: USH1C
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11, Position: 104,187,790-104,268,820
- Aliases: DFNB18, HARMONIN, PDZ-45, PDZ-containing protein 45, Protocadherin-15-binding protein

## Function
The USH1C gene encodes a protein called harmonin, which is involved in the development and maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells are responsible for converting sound waves into electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sound.

## External IDs

- NCBI Entrez: 10083
- Ensembl: ENSG00000110323
- OMIM: 605242
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95628

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg31Ter (rs72401564)
- p.Asp458Asn (rs781201660)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported.

## Related Disease
- Usher syndrome type 1C (USH1C)
- Non-syndromic hearing impairment

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Usher syndrome type 1C, but various treatments may be used to manage symptoms. Cochlear implants can help with hearing loss, while glasses or contact lenses may improve vision. Speech therapy and other forms of communication assistance can help with speech and language delays.

## Drug Response
No information is available about drug response for USH1C mutations.
