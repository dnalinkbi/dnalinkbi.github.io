## Gene Name and Information
**Gene:** CSF2RB  
**Pathway:** Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction  
**Chromosome Location:** 22q12.1-q12.3  
**Aliases:** CD131, IL3RB

## Function for Gene
The CSF2RB gene encodes a protein subunit that forms a receptor for interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 5 (IL-5) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This receptor plays an important role in the development, differentiation, and activation of hematopoietic cells in the immune system.

* **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000128274
* **OMIM ID:** 138981
* **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P32927

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
No amino acid mutations have been reported for the CSF2RB gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported for the CSF2RB gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CSF2RB have been associated with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a rare lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of surfactant proteins in the alveoli.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The current treatment for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis involves whole-lung lavage, a procedure in which the lungs are repeatedly washed with a saline solution to remove the accumulated surfactant proteins. In severe cases, lung transplantation may be necessary. The prognosis for individuals with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment.

## Drug Response
No known drugs have been targeted specifically to CSF2RB.
