## Information about PTCH1 gene

### Genetic position
The PTCH1 gene is located on chromosome 9q22.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the PTCH1 gene have been linked to the development of basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and Gorlin syndrome.

### Function
The PTCH1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as a receptor for the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. This pathway is important for embryonic development and tissue regeneration.

### Related disease
Mutations in PTCH1 have been associated with:
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Medulloblastoma
- Gorlin syndrome

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options for PTCH1-related cancers vary depending on the type and stage of the cancer. Prognosis also depends on these factors as well as the individual's overall health.

### Drug response
Vismodegib and Sonidegib are drugs that target the SHH pathway and may be effective in treating PTCH1-related cancers.
