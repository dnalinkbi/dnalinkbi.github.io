# Gene Information: POGZ

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: **16**
- Location: **16p11.2**
- Gene type: **Protein-coding**

## Pathology
- Mutations in POGZ have been associated with several neurological disorders including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures.

## Function
- POGZ encodes a protein called Pogo transposable element-derived protein with zinc finger domain (POGZ) that is involved in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression.
