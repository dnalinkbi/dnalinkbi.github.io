# Information about Gene CD200

## Genetic Position
Gene CD200 is located on chromosome 3 (3q13.2) and is composed of 5 exons.

## Pathology
Studies have shown that CD200 is downregulated in various cancers, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors. CD200 has also been linked to autoimmunity and neurodegenerative diseases. 

## Function
CD200 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It plays a key role in immune regulation by binding to its receptor, CD200R, which is expressed on various immune cells including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells. The interaction between CD200 and CD200R leads to the suppression of immune responses, making CD200 an essential immunoregulatory molecule.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
No missense mutations or protein-altering variants have been reported for CD200 in the dbSNP database as of September 2021.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations have been reported for CD200 in various cancers, including:

| Mutation      | Type          | dbSNP ID |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| c.532G>A      | Missense      | rs587780742 |
| c.967G>A      | Missense      | rs758443335 |
| c.1230C>G     | Missense      | rs200533219 |
| c.1042_1044del| Deletion      | rs786205795 |

## Related Disease
CD200 has been associated with various diseases, including cancers (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, colon cancer), autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease).

## Treatment and Prognosis
The downregulation of CD200 in cancer cells has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. Drugs that enhance the interaction between CD200 and CD200R, such as anti-CD200 monoclonal antibodies, have shown promise in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials for cancer treatment. However, more studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these drugs.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that CD200 expression levels may affect the response to certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy. For example, low CD200 expression has been associated with improved response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. High CD200 expression, on the other hand, has been linked to resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in various cancers.
