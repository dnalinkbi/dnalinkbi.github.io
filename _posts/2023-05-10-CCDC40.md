# Information about Gene CCDC40

### Genetic Position
CCDC40 is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q25.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the CCDC40 gene have been associated with a variety of respiratory diseases, specifically primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a disorder that affects the structure and function of cilia in the respiratory tract, leading to chronic respiratory infections.

### Function
The CCDC40 gene encodes a protein called coiled-coil domain-containing protein 40, which is involved in the assembly and movement of cilia.
