## Information about Gene NUDC

NUDC (NudC, NudC domain containing 1) is a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33.1). It encodes a protein called NudC which belongs to the NudC family of proteins. The NudC protein is involved in microtubule organization, mitotic spindle formation, and chromosome segregation during cell division.

### Function for Gene

The NudC protein plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, particularly during mitosis. It also regulates the formation and stabilization of microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs), which are important for proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been identified in the NUDC gene. Here are a few examples:

- c.208G>A (p.Val70Ile), rs34630858
- c.311C>T (p.Arg104Trp), rs267607183
- c.473T>G (p.Leu158Arg), rs886041717

All of the above mutations are missense mutations, meaning that they result in a change in a single amino acid in the NudC protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations in the NUDC gene that have been identified in various cancers. Here are a few examples:

- c.311C>T (p.Arg104Trp), rs267607183
- c.474A>G (p.Leu158Ser), rs886041717

Both of the above mutations are missense mutations identified in endometrial cancer.

### Related Disease

There is limited information about the role of the NUDC gene in disease. However, mutations in the NUDC gene have been suggested to play a role in certain forms of cancer, including endometrial cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no targeted treatment available for mutations in the NUDC gene. However, treatment options for endometrial cancer typically involve surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

### Drug Response

There is no information available at this time regarding drug response related to mutations in the NUDC gene.
