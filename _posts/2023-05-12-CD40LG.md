## Gene CD40LG

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- CD40LG (CD40 ligand) is located on the X chromosome, position Xq26.3.

- Pathologies associated with mutations in CD40LG include X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, which is characterized by recurrent infections due to low levels of immunoglobulin G and A in blood serum. Additionally, CD40LG mutations have been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune diseases.

- The function of CD40LG is to bind to CD40 on the surface of B cells to provide a co-stimulatory signal, which leads to B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells. This process is important for the production of antibodies in response to antigen exposure.

### Gene External IDs and Aliases

- External IDs for CD40LG include HGNC:11915, NCBI Entrez Gene:959, Ensembl:ENSG00000102606, OMIM: 300386, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P29965.

- Aliases for CD40LG include CD154, T-B cell-activating molecule, TNFSF5, TRAP, and GP39.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- A list of AA mutations in CD40LG and their corresponding mutation types and dbSNP IDs can be found on the NCBI dbSNP database.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Somatic SNVs/InDels in CD40LG can be found on the COSMIC database with their corresponding dbSNP IDs.

### Related Disease

- Mutations in CD40LG are associated with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome and an increased risk of autoimmune diseases.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome may involve immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent infections.

- Prognosis for individuals with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome varies depending on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.

### Drug Response

- There is limited information on drug response in individuals with mutations in CD40LG.
