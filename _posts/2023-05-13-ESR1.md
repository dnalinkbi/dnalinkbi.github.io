# Gene ESR1

## Information
- Pathology: ESR1 gene provides instructions for making the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) protein. This protein is a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. The ERα protein, which is primarily active in females, plays an important role in many tissues, including the breast, uterus, ovaries, bone cells, and brain tissue.
- Genomic location: Chromosome 6: 152,450,547-152,558,855

## Related Diseases
ESR1 gene mutations and aberrant expression are associated with several diseases and conditions. Some of them are:
- Breast cancer
- Endometrial cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Osteoporosis
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Neurodegenerative diseases

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of ESR1-related diseases depend on the specific condition and the individual case. For instance, endocrine therapies that target ERα protein, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, are frequently used for ER-positive breast cancer. However, resistance to such treatments can occur due to various mechanisms, including ESR1 mutations. Thus, additional strategies, such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, are also being investigated.

## Drug Response
ESR1 mutations can affect the response to endocrine therapies and other drugs that target ERα pathway. For instance, some mutations, such as p.Leu536Gln, have been associated with reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen and other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). On the other hand, some mutations, such as p.Ser463Phe, have been reported to confer increased sensitivity to fulvestrant, an ERα antagonist.
