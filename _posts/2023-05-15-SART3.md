# Information about Gene SART3

## Genetic Position 

SART3 is located at the chromosomal position of 2q34.

## Pathology

SART3 gene has been associated with various types of cancer including lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Mutations in the SART3 gene have also been associated with the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma.

## Function for Gene 

The SART3 gene encodes for a protein known as squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 3 (SART3). This protein is involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing, processing, and export from the nucleus.
