# Gene: RPS15 

RPS15 gene encodes the ribosomal protein S15, which is a component of the 40S small ribosomal subunit. It participates in the binding of the mRNA and tRNA during translation. The RPS15 gene is located on chromosome 19 at the position 19q13.42 and its aliases include RP5-1163H2.1, S15, and RPS15A.

## Related disease 
Studies have suggested that mutations in RPS15 gene may be associated with Pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a rare genetic disorder that reduces red blood cell production. 

## Treatment and prognosis 
The treatment and prognosis may vary depending upon the severity of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Supportive therapy, including blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and iron chelation, can effectively manage the disease. Bone marrow transplant and gene therapy are potential treatment options. 

## Drug response 
There are limited data available regarding drug responses associated with RPS15 gene mutations. Ribosomal protein modifiers such as mefloquine, clinical N-terminally truncated S11 protein (NTS11), or antisense morpholino oligonucleotides may be potential drug candidates for Diamond-Blackfan anemia.
