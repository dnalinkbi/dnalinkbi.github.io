## Gene: JAK1

### Function
The JAK1 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Janus kinase (JAK) family. This protein is a tyrosine kinase involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in several cellular processes, including immune response, cell growth, and differentiation.

### Related Disease
JAK1 mutations have been associated with a variety of diseases, including primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID), autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for JAK1-related diseases vary depending on the specific disease and the individual patient. Some JAK inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases and cancers.

### Drug Response
JAK inhibitors have been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases and cancers.
