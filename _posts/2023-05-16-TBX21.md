# Gene TBX21

## Gene Information
* **Function for gene:** TBX21 gene encodes a transcription factor called T-bet. T-bet is expressed in T-helper 1 cells and is required for their differentiation and effector function.
* **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    * Gene ID: 30009
    * Genomic Location: Chromosome 17
    * Aliases: TBET, T-box expressed in T-cells

## Mutations
* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
   * c.174G>A (p.Arg58His), missense variant, rs1138272
   * c.1673C>T (p.Arg558Trp), missense variant, rs72556371

* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
   * c.600del (p.Asn201HisfsTer34), Frameshift variant, rs398123344

## Related Diseases
* TBX21 mutations have been associated with various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
* There is no specific treatment for the mutations in TBX21 gene. Treatment is usually symptomatic and depends on the severity and progression of the autoimmune disease.

## Drug Response
* No specific drugs are available for TBX21 mutations. However, immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate are often prescribed to treat the autoimmune diseases associated with TBX21 mutations.
