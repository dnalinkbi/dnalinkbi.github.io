# Information about Gene HPGD

## Genetic Position
The HPGD gene (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase) is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 (4q34.1).

## Pathology
Variants in the HPGD gene have been associated with several diseases, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The gene is also involved in the regulation of inflammation and pain, making it a potential target for analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs.

## Function for Gene
The HPGD gene encodes the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, which is involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins, lipid signaling molecules that regulate inflammation, pain, and other processes in the body. The enzyme converts prostaglandins to their inactive forms, helping to control their biological effects.

## Related Disease
Variants in the HPGD gene have been associated with several diseases, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for HPGD-related diseases. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and addressing complications as they arise.

## Drug Response
The HPGD enzyme is a potential target for analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, as it plays a role in regulating prostaglandin levels in the body.
