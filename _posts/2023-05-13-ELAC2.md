# Information on Gene ELAC2

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

ELAC2 is a gene that is located on chromosome 17 (17p11.2). It encodes for a protein that is involved in the processing of transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Mutations in ELAC2 have been associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer. 

## Function for Gene

The function of ELAC2 is to process tRNA and rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis. The protein encoded by ELAC2 acts as an endonuclease that cleaves the precursor tRNA and rRNA molecules into mature, functional forms.

## Related Disease

Mutations in ELAC2 have been associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer. Individuals with certain mutations in the gene may have a higher risk for developing the disease than those without the mutations.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for prostate cancer may depend on the specific mutation and stage of the disease. In some cases, surgical removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy) may be recommended. Other treatments may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. 

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response for specific mutations in ELAC2.
