## Gene RAC1

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the RAC1 gene have been associated with various cancer types and developmental disorders such as the Oculo-Dental-Digital Syndrome (ODDD).

- **Function for gene:** The RAC1 gene encodes a GTPase that belongs to the Rho family of proteins. This protein regulates various cellular processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and proliferation.

- **Related disease:** Various cancer types such as melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer are associated with RAC1 mutations.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** RAC1 mutations are being studied as potential targets for cancer therapies. However, more research is needed to develop effective treatments.

- **Drug response:** Preclinical studies have shown that RAC1 inhibitors can potentially be used to treat cancers with RAC1 mutations.
