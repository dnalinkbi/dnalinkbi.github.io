## Gene CARD9

### Genetic position
CARD9 is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 at position 34.13 (9q34.13).

### Pathology
CARD9 gene is involved in multiple inflammatory diseases including Inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and Blau syndrome. Mutations in the CARD9 gene lead to a loss of function, impairing the immune response that is necessary to fight off certain infections.

### Function
CARD9 is an adaptor molecule that plays a crucial role in the signaling pathways for various immune receptors. Specifically, it is a critical component in mediating the response to fungal infections by initiating an inflammatory response.

### Related diseases
- Crohn's disease
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Blau syndrome
- Autoinflammatory diseases
- Fungal infections

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for the genetic mutations that lead to reduced CARD9 function. However, there are medications and therapies that can mitigate the symptoms of the related inflammatory diseases.

### Drug response
Studies have suggested that treatment with anti-fungal medications may be effective in combating fungal infections that result from the CARD9 deficiency.
