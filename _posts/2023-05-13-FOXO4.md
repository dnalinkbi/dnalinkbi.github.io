# Genetic Information on Gene FOXO4

## Gene Description
FOXO4 is a gene that encodes a member of the O class of forkhead box transcription factors. It is located on chromosome 11q13.1.

## Function
FOXO4 has been linked to several cellular processes including apoptosis, cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and aging. It functions as a transcriptional regulator.

## Related Diseases
FOXO4 has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Aberrant regulation of FOXO4 could be a contributing factor in the pathology of these diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options and prognosis vary depending on the disease and its severity.

## Drug Response
There is ongoing research on the potential use of FOXO4 inhibitors and activators as therapeutic agents. However, more studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety.

## Relevant Studies
- Study by David et al. ("FOXO4-Targeted Therapy as a Potential Strategy for the Treatment of Cancer") discusses the potential use of FOXO4 inhibitors for cancer treatment.
- Study by Klinkhammer et al. ("FOXO4 in Human Kidney Disease and Kidney Fibrosis") explores the role of FOXO4 in kidney disease.
