# Gene: HOXA1

### Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7p15.2)
- **Aliases:** HOX1, HOX1J, HOXA1A, HOXA1B, HOXA1C
- **Function:** HOXA1 encodes for a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the hindbrain and cranial nerves.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 5110
    - NCBI Entrez: 3198
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000106105
