# Gene HADH

## Genetic Position

The HADH gene maps to the long arm of chromosome 4 at position 4q22-q26.

## Pathology

Mutations in the HADH gene can cause 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (3-HAD deficiency). This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypoglycemia, seizures, and other symptoms resulting from inadequate energy production due to the inability to break down certain fatty acids. 

## Function

The HADH gene encodes an enzyme called 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. Specifically, this enzyme catalyzes the third step in the beta-oxidation pathway, which breaks down fatty acids for energy production.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are no known somatic mutations in the HADH gene listed in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease

3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (3-HAD deficiency) is caused by mutations in the HADH gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis

3-HAD deficiency is treated with careful dietary management and sometimes with medications to help control the symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the patient's prognosis.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available about drug response related to the mutations in the HADH gene.
