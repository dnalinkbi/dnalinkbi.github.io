## Gene Information

#### Gene: MED23 
                     
#### Function:
MED23 (Mediator complex subunit 23) gene encodes a subunit of the Mediator complex, which is a multiprotein complex that interacts with RNA polymerase II and  transcription factors to regulate transcription of protein-coding genes. MED23 plays a crucial role of Mediator complex in the regulation of gene transcription and expression.

#### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
No disease-causing mutations in MED23 have been reported so far.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There is no somatic mutation information available for MED23.

#### Related Disease:
In recent studies, rare de novo variants of MED23 have been associated with developmental delay or intellectual disability. MED23 gene variants are also observed in patients with different types of cancers and tumors.

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
It is important to closely monitor and manage patients diagnosed with developmental delay or intellectual disability related to MED23 gene mutations. There are no FDA-approved treatments available for these specific conditions yet, and treatment is currently limited to managing symptoms.

#### Drug Response:
There is no known drug response information for MED23.
