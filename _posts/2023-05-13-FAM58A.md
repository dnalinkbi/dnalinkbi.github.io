## Gene: FAM58A

### Genetic Position
FAM58A gene is located on chromosome 10q26.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the FAM58A gene have been associated with a variety of types of cancer, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

### Function
The function of the FAM58A gene is currently not well understood. Studies suggest that it may play a role in regulating cell cycle progression, and some evidence points towards a potential role in cell differentiation.
