# Gene EPB41

## Genetic Position
The EPB41 gene is located at chromosome 1q32.1, and its genomic coordinates are from 201,598,812 to 201,641,746.

## Pathology and Function
EPB41 encodes a protein known as Band 4.1 that has a crucial role in stabilizing the red blood cell membrane. The protein's function includes cell adhesion, cell signaling, and the regulation of cytoskeletal structure. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several disorders, including hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, and pyropoikilocytosis.

## External IDs and Aliases
The external IDs for EPB41 are as follows: 
- HGNC: 3350
- NCBI Entrez: 2035
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116761
- OMIM: 130500
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11171

The gene is also known by the following aliases: 4.1R, 4.1G, DBMD, DAL1, E41L, HEL-S-163p, HS2, HS3, MDRC, and MEL4.
