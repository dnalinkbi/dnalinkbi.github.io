# Gene: CCND1

## Pathology
CCND1 is a human gene that encodes a protein called Cyclin D1. It plays a role in cell cycle regulation and is involved in the transition from G1 to S phase. Overexpression or amplification of the CCND1 gene has been associated with various cancers, including breast, lung, and esophageal cancer.

## Function
The CCND1 gene encodes Cyclin D1, which regulates CDK4/6 activity, leading to the phosphorylation of the RB protein and the initiation of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are various treatment options depending on the type and stage of cancer. In breast cancer patients with high CCND1 expression, treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors has been successful in improving progression-free survival. However, it is important to note that there are conflicting reports on the use of Cyclin D1 as a prognostic factor in cancer.

## Drug Response
CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown potential in treating cancer patients with high CCND1 expression.
