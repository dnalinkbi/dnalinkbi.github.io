## Gene STK36

### Genetic Position
STK36 (serine/threonine kinase 36) is located at chromosome 2q32.2.

### Pathology 
Mutations in STK36 gene are associated with melanoma, neuroblastoma, and colorectal cancer.

### Function  
STK36 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway and plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
