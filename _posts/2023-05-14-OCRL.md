# Gene Information: OCRL

## Genetic Position: 
OCRL gene is located on the X chromosome in the q25 region (Xq25).

## Pathology:
Mutations in the OCRL gene are associated with Lowe Syndrome (LS), Dent-2 disease, and X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These disorders have overlapping clinical features and are caused by defects in the phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism.

## Function:
The OCRL gene encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase with dual specificity towards 5â€™ phosphatase activity on phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). This enzyme is involved in the regulation of several cellular mechanisms including endocytosis, exocytosis, cell motility, cytoskeleton organization, and lysosome function.

## Aliases:
- OCRL1
- Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome protein 1 (LOC1)
- OPHN2-related X-linked mental retardation protein (ORXR)
- Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase type II

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg272Gln | missense_variant | rs104894178
- p.Met1Gln | missense_variant | rs121908151
- p.Leu282Pro | missense_variant | rs147010648
- p.Pro567Arg | missense_variant | rs121908152
- p.Val370Leu | missense_variant | rs121908153

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There is no documented somatic mutation reported for OCRL gene.

## Related Disease:
- Lowe Syndrome (LS) - a rare X-linked disorder characterized by cataract formation, intellectual disability, renal tubular dysfunction, impaired growth, and skeletal abnormalities.
- Dent-2 disease - an X-linked renal proximal tubulopathy characterized by severe hypophosphatemia, general proximal tubule dysfunction, and rickets/osteomalacia.
- X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) - a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability with some individuals may show other symptoms like microcephaly, seizures, and psychiatric problems.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for Lowe syndrome or Dent-2 disease, and treatment is supportive. Patients require sodium and potassium supplementation, parathyroid hormone injections, and growth hormone therapy. A renal transplant is considered in case of severe renal impairment. Prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and associated complications.

## Drug Response:
There is no approved drug therapy for Lowe syndrome or Dent-2 disease. However, some therapies like cysteamine, rapamycin, and antioxidants have been evaluated in the pre-clinical or clinical setting.
