## Gene SMIM3
SMIM3 is a gene that codes for a small integral membrane protein. This gene is located on chromosome 1q32.1.

### Function
The exact function of SMIM3 is not yet fully understood, but it is suggested that this gene is involved in the formation of red blood cells.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the SMIM3 gene have been associated with Rh-null blood type. This is a rare blood type characterized by the lack of all Rh antigens on the surface of red blood cells.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for Rh-null blood type. However, this blood type does not appear to cause any health problems by itself.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in the SMIM3 gene.
