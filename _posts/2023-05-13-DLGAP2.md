## Information about Gene DLGAP2

### Genetic Position
DLGAP2 gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 8 (8q24.3)

### Pathology
DLGAP2 is the abbreviation for the protein Discs, large homolog-associated protein 2. Mutations in the DLGAP2 gene have been associated with various neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.

### Function
The protein coded by DLGAP2 gene plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of synaptic connections in the central nervous system (CNS). It is involved in synaptic transmission and has been shown to be an essential component in learning and memory processes.
