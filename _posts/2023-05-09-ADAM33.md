## Gene ADAM33
ADAM33 is a gene located on chromosome 20p13 and encodes for a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. It is expressed in bronchial epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. There is evidence that ADAM33 is associated with asthma, airway hyperresponsiveness, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

### Function
ADAM33 protein is a member of the ADAM family of proteins which are involved in proteolysis, cell adhesion, and signaling. It has a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain, a cytoplasmic domain, and a transmembrane domain. ADAM33 plays a role in airway remodeling by promoting the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, collagen deposition, and ECM remodeling.

### Related Disease
ADAM33 genetic variation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several respiratory diseases, including asthma, airway hyperresponsiveness, and COPD.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for respiratory diseases associated with ADAM33. Treatment options include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the individual response to treatment.

### Drug response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeting ADAM33. However, there are ongoing studies investigating the potential of ADAM33 inhibitors as a novel therapy for respiratory diseases.
