## Information about Gene FUS

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: FUS
- Chromosome: 16
- Location: 16p11.2-p11.1
- Pathology: Mutations in FUS are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

### Function
- FUS plays a role in RNA metabolism and has been implicated in many aspects of RNA processing including transcription, splicing, and mRNA transport. 
- It is also involved in DNA replication, DNA damage response, and homologous recombination.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 4020
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 2521
- Ensembl: ENSG00000196126
- OMIM: 137070
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35637
- Aliases: ALS6, FUS1, hnRNP P2, Pigpen

- c.321C>T (Synonymous) - rs201457551

### Related Disease
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
- Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for ALS or FTD, including those caused by mutations in FUS.
- Treatment options aim to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Drug Response
- There is limited research on drug responses specific to FUS-related diseases at this time.
