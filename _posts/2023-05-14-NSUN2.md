### Gene Information

Gene: NSUN2

Location: Chromosome 5q31.2

Pathology: NSUN2 has been shown to play a role in several cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. Mutations in NSUN2 have also been associated with intellectual disability and microcephaly.

Function: NSUN2 is an RNA methyltransferase that is involved in the modification of tRNA and other non-coding RNAs. It is also involved in DNA damage response and the regulation of cell cycle progression.

Aliases: NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2, MSKI, TRM4
