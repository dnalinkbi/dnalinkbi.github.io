# Information about gene C1GALT1C1

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene symbol: C1GALT1C1
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: 7q21.11
- Pathology: Possible association with gastric cancer

## Function
- Gene Function: The protein encoded by this gene is a type II membrane protein that catalyzes the transfer of a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue to the serine or threonine residues located in mucin-type proteins. 
- The product of this gene is involved in O-glycosylation of proteins and may play a role in cell migration and tumor metastasis.
