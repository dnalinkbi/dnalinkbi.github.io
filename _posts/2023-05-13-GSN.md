# Gene: GSN

## Information:

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 9:16,785,483-16,870,852
- **Pathology:** GSN mutations have been linked to familial amyloidosis, Finnish type (FAF).
- **Function:** The GSN gene encodes a protein called gelsolin, which functions in regulating actin filament dynamics and plays a role in cytoskeleton remodeling.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:

- There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the GSN gene.

## Related Diseases:

- Familial amyloidosis, Finnish type (FAF)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
