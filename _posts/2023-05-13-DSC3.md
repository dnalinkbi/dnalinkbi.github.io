# Gene Information for DSC3 

## Genetic Position
- The human DSC3 gene is located on chromosome 18q12.1
- The genomic location of the DSC3 gene is 18:30322027-30341797 (GRCh38.p13)

## Pathology
- DSC3 (Desmocollin-3) is a member of the desmosomal cadherin protein family.
- Mutations in DSC3 are associated with the development of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
- ARVC is a genetic disorder that affects the heart's muscle tissue, leading to arrhythmias and heart failure.

## Function
- The DSC3 gene encodes a protein called desmocollin-3 that plays a role in cell-cell adhesion in tissues that experience mechanical stress.
- It is primarily found in the skin, hair follicles, and myocardium.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 1831
- HGNC: 2918
- Ensembl: ENSG00000176371
- NCBI Entrez: 1831
- OMIM: 600194
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14574
- Aliases: ARVC8, CDHF5, HDGC

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- There are various AA mutations reported in DSC3 gene that are associated with ARVC.
- Some of the reported AA mutations with dbSNP ID include:
    - p.Arg283* (rs1555320032)
    - p.Ser290Leu (rs367543250)
    - p.Arg307Gln (rs137853297)
- These mutations are mainly frameshift, nonsense, missense, and splicing mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are fewer somatic SNVs/InDels reported in DSC3 gene compared to germline mutations.
- Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID include:
    - c.1048A>G (rs139981296)
    - c.1078A>T (rs765966701)
- These mutations are associated with various cancers and not ARVC.

## Related Disease
- The DSC3 gene is associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the heart's muscle tissue.
- ARVC can lead to arrhythmias and heart failure, and it is one of the major causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure for ARVC, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of SCD.
- The prognosis for ARVC varies depending on the severity and extent of the disease, but the condition can be life-threatening if left untreated.
- In severe cases, heart transplantation may be necessary.

## Drug Response
- There is no specific drug available for treating ARVC.
- However, some drugs such as beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, and diuretics may be used to manage the symptoms of the disease.
