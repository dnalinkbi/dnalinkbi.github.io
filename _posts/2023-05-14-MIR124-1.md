# Gene: MIR124-1

## Genetic Position
- MIR124-1 gene is located on chromosome 8p23.1.

## Pathology
- Studies have shown that MIR124-1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Its downregulation has been found to be associated with the development and progression of several types of cancer.

## Function
- MIR124-1 gene codes for a microRNA that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell differentiation, particularly in the nervous system.
