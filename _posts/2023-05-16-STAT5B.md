## Gene Name and Information
Gene Name: STAT5B (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B)

## Function
STAT5B is a transcription factor that regulates several cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and survival of immune cells. It plays a crucial role in regulating the differentiation and function of T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and mast cells.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: HGNC:11363
- NCBI Entrez: 6777
- Ensembl: ENSG00000132356
- OMIM: 604260
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51692

Genomic location: Chromosome 17q21.

Aliases: STAT5, IMD31B, STAT5A.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations reported for STAT5B gene. Some of them are:

- R392C - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs757729770)
- D209N - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs35677466)
- G419V - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs869025353)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs/InDels were reported for STAT5B gene in cancer. Some of them are:

- p.G416D - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs751901495)
- p.V402E - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs757842661)
- p.W595R - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs522807489)

## Related Diseases
STAT5B mutations are implicated in several diseases, including:
- Immunodeficiency 31C (IMD31C)
- Colorectal cancer
- Acute myeloid leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis vary depending on the disease and the type of mutation. In general, STAT5B mutant-driven cancers are associated with a poor prognosis and aggressive phenotype. However, there are ongoing research studies to develop targeted therapies against STAT5B.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs that target STAT5B mutations. However, some preclinical studies have shown promising results with inhibitors targeting STAT5B signaling pathways.
