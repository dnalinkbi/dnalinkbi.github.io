## Gene: B3GNT3

- Function: B3GNT3 gene encodes a member of the beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family. The protein catalyzes the addition of a N-acetylglucosamine residue to a core precursor oligosaccharide to form the common repeating unit of O-glycans. The addition of these oligosaccharides shows diverse functions including cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response processes.
