# Information about gene CD27

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position:** The CD27 gene is located on chromosome 12p13.31.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the CD27 gene have been associated with different types of cancer, including Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

**Function:** The CD27 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the TNF-receptor superfamily. This protein is involved in the activation of the immune system by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of B cells and T cells.

## Gene Information

**External IDs:** HGNC:1708, NCBI Entrez: 939, Ensembl: ENSG00000136997, OMIM: 186711, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P26842.

**Aliases:** S152, T14.
