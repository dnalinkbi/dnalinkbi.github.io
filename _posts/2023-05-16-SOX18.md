# Gene: SOX18

**Function:** The SOX18 gene encodes a transcription factor that has critical roles in lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis during embryogenesis and development. It is also involved in the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation and migration, as well as the maintenance of vascular endothelial integrity.

**External IDs and Genomic location:**

- HGNC ID: 11171
- NCBI Entrez ID: 6432
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000128714
- OMIM ID: 601618
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P35713
- Genomic location: Chromosome 20: 45,184,696 - 45,191,823

**Aliases:**

- VEGF-D activating factor
- VEGFD-associated factor
- Transcription factor SOX-18

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

There are multiple AA mutations identified in the SOX18 gene, and some of them are listed below with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Q87* | Nonsense | rs869025338 |
| R29W | Missense | rs267607162 |
| R83H | Missense | rs267607163 |
| R138W | Missense | rs121912710 |
| Q189E | Missense | rs121912709 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) reported in the SOX18 gene, and some of them with their dbSNP ID are listed below:

- rs762691460
- rs879255293
- rs778585250

**Related Diseases:**

- Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (HLTS): caused by mutations in the SOX18 gene.
- Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT): SOX18 mutations are considered as one of the risk factors for CAKUT.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is no cure for Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome, and treatment is generally symptomatic. Prognosis varies with the severity of the symptoms.

**Drug Response:**

There is no known specific drug for the treatment of SOX18 related conditions.
