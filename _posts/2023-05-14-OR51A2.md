# Gene Information for OR51A2 

## Genetic Position
- OR51A2 is a gene located on chromosome 11 at the position q13.4.

## Pathology and Function 
- OR51A2 codes for the olfactory receptor OR51A2, which is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family. It is primarily involved in detecting and processing chemical signals that are perceived as odors. 

## External IDs, Genomic Location, and Aliases
- External IDs for the OR51A2 gene include:
  - HGNC: 24487 
  - NCBI Entrez: 266079 
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000238273 
  - OMIM: 612497 
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NG30 
- OR51A2 is located at the following genomic coordinates: Chr11: 70,690,603-70,691,593 (GRCh38.p13). 
- Aliases for the OR51A2 gene include olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily A member 2, OR11-3, and OR11A3.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are multiple missense mutations reported for OR51A2 that result in amino acid changes: 
  - E46K (rs61732219)
  - E110K (rs10789865)
  - R197A (rs139342435)
  - R197H (rs139342435)
  - R206W (rs146828253)
- All of the mutations mentioned above are reported as "benign" or "likely benign" in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the OR51A2 gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
- While there is no specific disease associated with mutations in the OR51A2 gene, studies have shown that olfactory receptors, including OR51A2, are involved in various physiological and pathological processes such as odor perception, reproduction, and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known treatment or specific prognosis for OR51A2 mutations at this time.

## Drug Response
- There is no known information regarding drug response for OR51A2 mutations at this time.
