## Information about Gene PLTP

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 20: 62,167,593-62,198,085 
- **Pathology:** The gene PLTP is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and atherosclerosis. A study has shown that a decrease in the function of PLTP may increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
- **Function for Gene:** PLTP encodes for a phospholipid transfer protein that facilitates the transfer of phospholipids between lipoproteins, which is important for lipid metabolism. 
- **Aliases:** Phospholipid Transfer Protein, PLTP1, PLTP2
- **External IDs:** 
  - HGNC: 9057
  - NCBI Entrez: 5360
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000101492
  - OMIM: 602082
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55058
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
  - p.Arg37His(rs2294215)
  - p.Ala156Thr(rs56160432)
  - p.Ala157Thr(rs3730004)
  - p.Thr168Ala(rs56189182)
  - p.Gln368Ter(rs146827366)
  - p.Gln421Ter(rs124826074)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - c.892C>T(rs78731633)
  - c.1270T>G(rs147902514)
  - c.1661G>A(rs147281531)
  - c.1661G>T(rs147281531)
- **Related Diseases:** Obesity, Atherosclerosis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no direct treatment for decreased PLTP functionality. However, managing underlying metabolic disorders through lifestyle changes and medication can improve prognosis.
- **Drug Response:** A study suggests that people with genetic variations that lead to decreased PLTP function may have a better response to statin therapy for managing cholesterol levels.
