## Gene: AMER1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: X
- Location: Xq11.2

### Pathology
- AMER1 is associated with the development of tumors, specifically in the colon and endometrium. Mutations in AMER1 have been identified in a subset of colorectal and endometrial cancers.

### Function
- AMER1 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell growth, differentiation, and development.
