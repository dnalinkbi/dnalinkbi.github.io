## Gene: MLXIPL

### Information:
- **Function:** The MLXIPL gene, also called carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and adipose tissue.
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: HGNC:17200
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 51085
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000126762
    - OMIM ID: 605678
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NP71
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 7 (7q11.23)
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.744C>T (p.Ala248Val) rs189684622
    - c.770C>G (p.Ala257Gly) rs201904982
    - c.836C>T (p.Arg279Trp) rs779378522
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs11537761
    - rs4444132
- **Related Disease:** mutations in MLXIPL have been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no specific treatment for MLXIPL mutations. Treatment for NAFLD and type 2 diabetes typically involves lifestyle changes and medications to manage symptoms.
- **Drug Response:** None reported for MLXIPL specifically, but drug responses for NAFLD and type 2 diabetes may vary depending on the patient.
