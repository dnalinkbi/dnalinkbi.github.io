## Information on Gene TNNC1

### Genetic Position
TNNC1 is located on chromosome 3 at position 3p21.3.

### Pathology
Variations in the TNNC1 gene have been linked to cardiomyopathies, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). 

### Function for Gene
TNNC1 encodes a protein called troponin C, which plays a key role in regulating muscle contraction. Troponin C interacts with calcium ions to initiate muscle contraction in response to nerve impulses.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some examples of amino acid (AA) mutations in the TNNC1 gene and their mutation type are:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Asp145Asn | Missense | rs137852945 |
| Ser92Asn | Missense | rs1057518802 |
| Glu134Lys | Missense | rs749224289 |
| Val44Ile | Missense | rs587777467 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Data on somatic SNVs/InDels in the TNNC1 gene is currently limited. 

### Related Disease
Variations in the TNNC1 gene have been linked to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for DCM and HCM vary depending on the severity of symptoms. Medications such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors may be used to manage symptoms and improve heart function. In some cases, surgery or implantation of a pacemaker may be necessary. The prognosis for individuals with cardiomyopathies can also vary, but early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes. 

### Drug Response
Data on drug response in individuals with variations in the TNNC1 gene is currently limited.
