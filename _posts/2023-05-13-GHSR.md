# Gene: GHSR

## Information

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 3p25.1
- **Pathology**: Mutations in GHSR have been associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and growth hormone disorders.
- **Function of gene**: GHSR, or growth hormone secretagogue receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.
- **External IDs and Aliases**:
  - HGNC: 4268
  - NCBI Entrez: 2693
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000114779
  - OMIM: 601898
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q92847
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
  - c.361G>A (p.Arg121His) - rs137853688
  - c.328T>C (p.Phe110Leu) - rs201226611
  - c.494G>A (p.Trp165Ter) - rs137853689
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
  - c.601G>A (p.Arg201His) - rs137853690
- **Related diseases**: 
  - Growth hormone disorders
  - Prader-Willi syndrome
  - Obesity
- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment options for individuals with GHSR mutations depend on the specific disorder and symptoms present. For growth hormone disorders, recombinant human growth hormone therapy may be indicated. Weight loss interventions may be recommended for individuals with GHSR mutations and obesity.
- **Drug response**: Agonists of GHSR may be used to stimulate growth hormone secretion in individuals with growth hormone disorders.
