# Information about Gene PEX12

## Gene information

Gene PEX12, also known as Peroxin-12, is located on chromosome 17p11.2. The gene has 14 exons and spans about 28 kb.

## Pathology and Function

PEX12 encodes a peroxin that is involved in the import of proteins into peroxisomes. Pathogenic variants in this gene are known to cause Zellweger syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organ systems. Patients with Zellweger syndrome typically present with severe neurological, hepatic, and renal abnormalities and have a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate in the first year of life.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Several pathogenic variants have been reported in PEX12, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants. Some of the common missense variants include:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| p.Arg282Trp | Missense      | rs137852500 |
| p.Asn386Ser | Missense      | rs137852501 |
| p.Ala379Pro | Missense      | rs137852502 |
| p.Ala145Ser | Missense      | rs137852503 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic mutations have been reported in PEX12 so far.

## Related Disease

Pathogenic variants in PEX12 are associated with Zellweger syndrome and other peroxisome biogenesis disorders.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for Zellweger syndrome, and treatment is mainly supportive. Early diagnosis and intervention may improve the prognosis and quality of life for affected individuals.

## Drug response

Currently, there are no drugs available that target PEX12 specifically.
