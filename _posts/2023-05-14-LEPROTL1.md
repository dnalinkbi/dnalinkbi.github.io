## LEPROTL1 Gene Information

**Genetic Position**: The LEPROTL1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.13).

**Pathology**: Mutations in the LEPROTL1 gene have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called Kufor-Rakeb syndrome.

**Function**: The LEPROTL1 gene encodes a protein called leprosin, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy and lysosomal function.

**External IDs and Aliases**: 
- HGNC: 29357
- NCBI Entrez: 114825
- Ensembl: ENSG00000143168
- OMIM: 612227
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96JA1

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
No amino acid mutations have been reported for LEPROTL1 in the dbSNP database.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
No somatic variants have been reported for LEPROTL1 in the dbSNP database.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in LEPROTL1 have been associated with Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by parkinsonism, dementia, and spasticity.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no cure for Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, and treatment is based on the individual symptoms presented by each patient.

**Drug Response**: There is currently no specific drug treatment for Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, although medications such as levodopa and anticholinergic drugs can be used to manage the symptoms.
