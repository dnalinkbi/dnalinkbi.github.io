# Information about gene CLK2

## Gene: CLK2
- **Function:** CLK2 is a protein kinase involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and transcription. It phosphorylates serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and controls their localization.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: [1195]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1195)
    - Genomic location: [2q33.3]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1195#location)
    - Aliases: CDC2L4, CDC2L5, LF2

- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** [P49759]([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49759)

## Mutations:
- **AA mutation list:** The [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry]([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49759) lists several amino acid (AA) substitutions and deletions reported in various studies. Notable ones include:
    - R308K (rs35060700)
    - W338S (rs61752463)
    - R323S (rs61752462)
- **Mutation type:** These mutations are missense variations, which means a single nucleotide change in the DNA sequence results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the CLK2 protein.
- **dbSNP ID:** The missense mutations mentioned above have dbSNP IDs assigned to them as indicated in parentheses.

## Related disease:
- There is currently no known disease directly linked to mutations in CLK2. However, CLK2 activity has been implicated in cancer and viral infections due to its role in alternative splicing regulation.

## Treatment and prognosis:
- As there is no clinical disease associated with CLK2 mutations, there is no specific treatment or prognosis.

## Drug response:
- Information about drug response related to CLK2 is limited and currently under investigation.
