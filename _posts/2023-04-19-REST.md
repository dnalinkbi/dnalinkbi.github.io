# Gene REST 

## Genetic Position
REST (RE1-Silencing Transcription factor), also known as NRSF (Neural Restrictive Silencer Factor), is located on human chromosome 4 (4q12).

## Function
REST is a transcriptional repressor that silences a subset of neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues. Specifically, REST binds to a DNA sequence called the RE1 (Restrictive Element 1) to repress the expression of genes important for neural differentiation and synaptic function.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
No AA mutation is reported for the REST gene in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
REST is not commonly mutated in cancer or other diseases. I wasn't able to find any SNVs or InDels associated with REST in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
There are several neurological disorders in which aberrant REST function has been implicated, including epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no direct treatment targeting REST expression. However, researchers are exploring drugs that can inhibit REST activity as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

## Drug Response 
There is currently no information on specific drug response related to REST.
