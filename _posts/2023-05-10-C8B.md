## Gene Information for C8B
### Gene Function
The C8B gene encodes one of the subunits of the complement protein component 8, which together with other complement components, takes part in the immune response against foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses.

### Gene External IDs, Genomic Location, and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 1375
- NCBI Entrez ID: 735
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000213380
- OMIM ID: 120790
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P07360
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1q32.2
- Aliases: C8beta, C8B1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are various amino acid mutations that have been reported for the C8B gene. Some of the reported mutations along with the mutation type and their dbSNP ID are listed below:
- Lys27Asn (missense) rs121912501
- Lys94Gln (missense) rs121912500
- Pro137Leu (missense) rs555607021
- Val194Met (missense) rs121912498

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for C8B gene. Some of them with their corresponding dbSNP ID are listed below:
- rs1057519485
- rs1057519486
- rs1057519487

### Related Disease
There are several diseases reported to be related to mutations in the C8B gene, including:
- Neisseria meningitidis infection
- Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)
- Non-lupus membranous nephropathy 

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for diseases related to C8B gene mutations depend on the specific condition and its severity. For example, treatment options for meningococcal infections may include antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), or plasma therapies, while aHUS may be treated with eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits complement activation.

### Drug Response
The response to drugs for diseases related to C8B gene mutations may also depend on the specific condition and its severity. For example, eculizumab has been shown to be effective in treating aHUS in some patients, but its effectiveness may vary depending on the individual case.
