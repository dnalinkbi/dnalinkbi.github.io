## Gene: RET

### Function
The RET gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and function of nerve cells. The RET protein helps signal cells to grow and divide through a process called cell signaling. RET is essential for the normal development of several nerve cell types. Mutations in RET can cause certain types of cancer and inherited disorders that affect the development and function of nerve cells.

### Related Disease
* Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN2)
* Hirschsprung disease (HSCR)
* Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific condition caused by RET mutations. Surgical removal of the affected tissues, radiation therapies, and chemotherapy may be used to treat MEN2 and medullary thyroid carcinoma. The prognosis for individuals with RET-related conditions varies widely depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

### Drug Response
Several drugs targeting RET-related conditions are currently in clinical trials, including drugs that inhibit RET signaling, such as vandetanib and cabozantinib.
