## Gene Information Analysis: TH Gene

### Gene Information

- Gene Name: TH
- Genomic Position: 11p15.5
- Aliases: TYH, Tyrosine 3-Hydroxylase


### Gene Function

The TH gene provides instructions for making the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme, which is pivotal in dopamine biosynthesis. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the brain that modulates fine movement control, cognition, and reward behaviors.

### External IDs and Genomic Location

- HGNC: 11586
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 7054
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135246
- OMIM: 191290
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07101

### Mutation Information

#### AA Mutation List

- L62V (rs35477510)
- V81I (rs45590233)
- A152T (rs7193)
- D211N (rs56112968)
- R233Q (rs62568484)
- R233W (rs76804188)

#### Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- Missense mutation (rs35477510, rs45590233, rs7193, rs56112968, rs62568484, rs76804188)


### Somatic SNVs/Indels

- No somatic variants were found for TH.

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the TH gene are associated with a rare disorder called dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), which is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive difficulty of movement. The symptoms of DRD often show a positive response to the administration of small doses of levodopa.

### Treatment and Prognosis

The primary treatment for DRD is the administration of levodopa, which is converted into dopamine in the brain. Levodopa treatment is known to improve motor symptoms, but may have side effects such as dyskinesia and dystonia. The long-term prognosis for DRD patients is usually positive with proper medication and management of symptoms.

### Drug Response

DRD patients show a positive response to the administration of levodopa as a primary treatment. However, the response may vary among patients, and dose adjustments and long-term management may be necessary.
