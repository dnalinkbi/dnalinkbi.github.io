# Gene KLKB1

## Overview

KLKB1 (kallikrein B) is a gene that encodes for a serine protease, also known as plasma kallikrein, which is involved in the activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis and the kinin-kallikrein system. KLKB1 is located on chromosome 4q34 and consists of 16 exons. 

## Function

KLKB1 plays a key role in the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades. It cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to produce bradykinin, a potent vasodilator peptide. It also activates factor XII, prekallikrein and plasminogen, and cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin clots.

## Related disease

KLKB1 mutations have been linked to hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of edema in various parts of the body, including the airways, digestive tract and skin. 

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for HAE generally involves the use of C1 inhibitor, a drug that can help prevent the swelling associated with the condition. Prognosis for individuals with HAE is generally good with timely and appropriate medical care.

## Drug response

There are currently no known drugs specifically targeting KLKB1. However, C1 inhibitor and other medications can be used to manage the symptoms of conditions like HAE.
