# Gene LRP2

LRP2 (Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 2), also known as Megalin, is a gene that encodes for a transmembrane protein which functions as an endocytic receptor for a wide range of ligands, including lipoproteins, enzymes, hormones, and cytokines. This gene plays an important role in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and renal reabsorption. 

## Function for gene

LRP2/Megalin plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, where it serves as a transporter of essential nutrients and a scavenger of potentially harmful substances. This gene is also involved in the regulation of embryonic development, neuronal migration, and synaptic plasticity.

## Related disease

Mutations in LRP2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including Donnai-Barrow syndrome, autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A, autism, and essential hypertension.

## Treatment and prognosis

As of now, there is no known cure for genetic disorders caused by LRP2 mutations. The treatment mainly aims to alleviate the symptoms. The prognosis varies depending on the severity and type of the disease. 

## Drug response

There is no known drug that specifically targets mutations in LRP2 gene. However, some drugs have been reported to modulate LRP2 expression and function, including vitamin D3, heparin, and transthyretin.
