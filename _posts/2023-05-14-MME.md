# Gene MME

Gene MME is also known as membrane metalloendopeptidase. It is located on chromosome 3 and spans 61.89 kb. The genomic coordinates for MME are 46,881,101 to 46,942,999. 

### Function for Gene

The MME gene encodes for the membrane metalloendopeptidase enzyme, which functions as a neuropeptidase and endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds between hydrophobic residues. It plays an essential role in the metabolism of several neuroactive peptides, including substance P, enkephalins, beta-amyloid, and neurotensin. It also regulates the signaling of several hormones, including renin and angiotensin II.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have been identified in the MME gene in different types of cancer. The following are some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

| Mutation | Cancer Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C>T | Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma | rs121913527 |
| A>G | Lung adenocarcinoma | rs369834650 |
| G>A | Ovarian clear cell carcinoma | rs151188739 |

### Related Disease

Mutations in the MME gene are associated with different diseases, including hypertension, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. The loss of MME activity has been linked to an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases.

### Treatment and Prognosis

MME inhibitors are potential therapeutic targets for several diseases, including hypertension and cancer. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in the MME gene depends on the type of mutation, age at onset, and the presence of other underlying health conditions.

### Drug Response

MME gene variants may affect drug metabolism and response to medications, such as opioid analgesics, antihypertensives, and chemotherapeutic agents.
