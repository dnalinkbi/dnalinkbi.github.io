# Information about Gene VANGL1

## Genetic Position

VANGL1 is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p13.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in the VANGL1 gene are associated with several health conditions, including neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and hydrocephalus.

## Function

VANGL1 encodes a protein called Vang-like protein 1, which is involved in the regulation of cell polarity during development.

## External IDs and Aliases

- NCBI Entrez: 81839
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135744
- OMIM: 610132
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NC56

Aliases: JLNS1, PP2388, STB, STRABISMUS, VAN2, and VANGL.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations reported in the VANGL1 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations.

Some examples of the AA mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

- p.(Gly149Ser) rs139463239

- p.(Arg377*) rs104894589

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs and InDels reported in the VANGL1 gene, including missense, synonymous, frameshift, and splice site mutations.

Some examples of somatic mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

- c.858A>T rs147460878
- c.924G>A rs372863725
- c.1026delC rs147461109

## Related Disease

Mutations in the VANGL1 gene are associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and hydrocephalus.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for neural tube defects, but there are surgical treatments available to manage the symptoms.

The prognosis for individuals with NTDs varies depending on the severity of the condition and other factors.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response specific to mutations in VANGL1.
