## Gene: SLC52A3

### Genetic Position:
SLC52A3 gene is located on chromosome 20q13 and spans about 25 kb.

### Pathology:
Mutations in SLC52A3 gene have been linked to various diseases including riboflavin transporter deficiency 2 (BCHM62), early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS), Fazio-Londe disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.

### Function:
SLC52A3 gene encodes for riboflavin transporter. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is essential for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acid. SLC52A3 transports riboflavin into the cell and regulates its homeostasis.

### AA Mutation List and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
|AA position|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|p.Arg163Trp|Missense|rs774497666|
|p.Gly36Asp|Missense|rs118204285|
|p.Ile141Val|Missense|rs755966084|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic mutations have been reported for SLC52A3 gene.

### Related Disease:
- Riboflavin transporter deficiency 2
- Early-onset epileptic encephalopathy
- Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome
- Fazio-Londe disease
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for riboflavin transporter deficiency. Riboflavin supplementation, which increases the riboflavin level, can be effective in treating the symptoms. Prognosis of the disease is different and depends on the severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response:
No specific drug has been identified to cure SLC52A3 related diseases. Riboflavin supplementation can be helpful in patients with riboflavin transporter deficiency.
