# Gene TNKS

## Genetic Position
The TNKS gene is located on the long arm of chromosome  tankyrase 1, PARP5A, TNKL, ARTD5.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TNKS gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and telomeropathies.

## Function
The TNKS gene encodes the tankyrase protein, which plays a role in telomere regulation, mitotic spindle formation, and the Wnt signaling pathway.
