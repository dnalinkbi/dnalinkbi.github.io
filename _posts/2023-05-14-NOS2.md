# Gene NOS2

## Genetic Position

The gene NOS2 is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17q11.2. It spans a length of approximately 34.6 kilobases.

## Pathology

NOS2 is involved in the production of nitric oxide, an important molecule in various physiological processes. Dysregulation of NOS2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders.

## Function

The NOS2 gene is responsible for producing the nitric oxide synthase enzyme, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of nitric oxide from L-arginine. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure. It also functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system and is involved in the immune response.

## External IDs

Some of the external IDs for the NOS2 gene and its location include:

- HGNC: 7878
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 4843
- Ensembl: ENSG00000164867
- OMIM: 163731
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35228

## Aliases

NOS2 is also known by several other names such as:

- Inducible NOS
- Inducible nitric oxide synthase
- iNOS
- NOS type II

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Some of the reported amino acid (AA) mutations and their types in the NOS2 gene include:

- F164S, missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs33954709
- G847E, missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs11574879
- P386L, missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs817693

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic SNVs (single nucleotide variations) and InDels (insertions/deletions) reported in the NOS2 gene with their dbSNP IDs include:

- c.1573G>A, missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs79582360
- c.2033C>T, missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs121918019

## Related Disease

NOS2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as:

- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Asthma
- Cancer
- Cardiovascular diseases

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no definitive treatment for dysregulated NOS2 activity. However, several drugs have been developed to modulate nitric oxide synthesis. The prognosis of diseases related to NOS2 dysregulation varies depending on the specific condition and the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response

Several drugs have been developed to modulate nitric oxide synthesis and are being investigated for their potential therapeutic use. For example, nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates have been used to treat cardiovascular disorders. Inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis have been developed for the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
