## Gene: PTH1R

### Genetic Position
The PTH1R gene is located on chromosome 3 (3p21.31) and spans about 24.9 kb.

### Pathology
Mutations in PTH1R have been associated with diseases affecting bone development and maintenance, including primary failure of tooth eruption, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. 

### Function
PTHR1 is a membrane receptor protein, which plays an important role in calcium metabolism by regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). It promotes bone resorption and regulates phosphate excretion in the kidney.

### Related Disease
PTH1R mutations have been associated with several bone-related diseases including Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, osteogenesis imperfecta, and primary failure of tooth eruption.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options for these conditions often involve symptom management, supportive care, and physical therapy, but no targeted therapies for PTH1R mutations are currently available. 

### Drug Response
Studies have suggested that treatments targeting the PTH1R pathway, such as calcimimetics and PTH analogs, may be effective in treating osteoporosis and bone disorders associated with PTH1R mutations.
