# Gene Information

## Gene: HOXB1

### General Information
- **Function**: HOXB1 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in embryonic development, specifically in the development of the hindbrain, facial structures, and inner ear.
- **External IDs**: HGNC:4964; NCBI Entrez Gene:3207; Ensembl:ENSG00000164929; OMIM:142955; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P09651
- **Aliases**: HOX2, HU-2

### Mutation Information
- **AA Mutation List**: N/A
- **Mutation Type**: N/A
- **dbSNP ID**: N/A
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**: N/A
- **dbSNP ID**: N/A

### Related Diseases
- **Disease**: Athabaskan brainstem dysgenesis syndrome (ABDS)
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal recessive
- **Symptoms**: Facial dysmorphism, brainstem dysfunction, and hearing loss.
- **Genetic Changes**: Mutations in HOXB1 gene

### Treatment and Prognosis
- **Treatment**: No cure for ABDS
- **Prognosis**: Life expectancy is reduced, and may depend on the severity of the ABDS symptoms.

### Drug Response
- No known drug treatments for ABDS.
