## Analysis of Gene TCF12

### Genetic Position
- The gene TCF12 is located on chromosome 15 at the position q21.2.

### Pathology
- Mutations and alterations in the TCF12 gene have been associated with several pathological conditions, including craniosynostosis, which is a congenital disorder where the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull close prematurely leading to a restricted growth of the skull and brain.

### Function
- The TCF12 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of various developmental processes, including osteogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and cranial suture closure.

### External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location
- HGNC:11826, Ensembl:ENSG00000078328, NCBI Entrez Gene: 6932, OMIM:600480, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q99081
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 15, q21.2
- Aliases: HEB, bHLHa15

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.643G>A, p.Arg215His (rs121908164)
- c.124G>A, p.Gly42Ser (rs201931858)
- c.910T>C, p.Val304Ala (rs112408867)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.464A>T, p.Met155Leu (rs778986001)

### Related Disease
- Craniosynostosis

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Patients with craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the TCF12 gene usually require surgical intervention to correct the abnormalities. The prognosis of craniosynostosis varies based on the severity of the condition and age of the patient at the time of diagnosis.

### Drug Response
- No information available on drug response for TCF12.
