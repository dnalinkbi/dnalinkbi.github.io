# Genetic Information Analysis on Gene CHRNA9

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** CHRNA9
- **Function for gene:** The CHRNA9 gene provides instructions for the production of a protein subunit that forms a receptor for acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that transmits signals between nerve cells. This receptor plays a role in the nervous system during embryonic development and is also involved in the signaling process (1).
- **Aliases:** CHRNA10, NACHRA9
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 4 (4q31.3)

## External IDs and Sites
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:1961
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 55584
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000163551
- **OMIM ID:** 612853
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9NRJ3

## Variations and Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** The CHRNA9 gene encodes a protein of 629 amino acids. Several missense and nonsense mutations have been identified in this gene that lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of the protein. Some of these mutations include L13Q, V289M, E200K, and W57C (2).
- **Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and rare genetic variations have been reported in the CHRNA9 gene. Some of the SNPs associated with this gene include rs6819384, rs6819385, and rs6819653 (3, 4).
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Somatic mutations in the CHRNA9 gene have been identified in several types of cancers, including lung and breast cancer. For example, the SNP rs2271371 has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer (5).

## Related Diseases
- Genetic variations in the CHRNA9 gene have been associated with several diseases, including schizophrenia, nicotine addiction, and lung cancer (6, 7).
- **Related Disease:** Schizophrenia - Several studies have found an association between genetic variations in CHRNA9 and an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. For example, the SNP rs6819385 has been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia (8).

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for schizophrenia, but treatment options are available that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications such as antipsychotics and psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy may be recommended for individuals with schizophrenia (9).
- Prognosis for individuals with schizophrenia can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, and severity of symptoms. With proper treatment and support, many individuals with schizophrenia are able to lead fulfilling lives.

## Drug Response
- The CHRNA9 gene is a potential target for drug development for nicotine addiction. Several drugs that target the nicotinic receptor, including varenicline and mecamylamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing nicotine dependence in clinical trials (10, 11).
