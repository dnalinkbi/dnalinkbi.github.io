# Gene: NOTCH2 

**Function:** 
The NOTCH2 gene encodes a protein that acts as a transcription factor. It plays a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is responsible for cell-to-cell communication. This gene regulates the differentiation of cells, cell survival, and cell death.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC:7555
- NCBI Entrez:4853 
- Ensembl:ENSG00000134325 
- OMIM:600275
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q04721 

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1q23.3 

**Aliases:** 
- AIA6 
- hN2
- HN2
- NOTCH2A
- TAN1

**AA Mutation List:**
There are several AA mutations reported in the NOTCH2 gene. Some of the most common ones are:
- p.Arg605Cys (rs28936694)
- p.Leu1597Pro (rs267607129)
- p.Gly1557Asp (rs773834298)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are many somatic mutations reported in the NOTCH2 gene, some of which are associated with cancer. Some of the most common ones are:
- c.6506C>T (rs121912744)
- c.6967T>G (rs369196397)
- c.8257C>G (rs121912745)

**Related Disease:**
Mutations in the NOTCH2 gene are associated with a range of diseases, including:
- Alagille syndrome
- Hajdu-Cheney syndrome
- Cutis laxa
- Leukemia

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
There is no specific treatment for NOTCH2 gene mutations, but treatments are aimed at managing symptoms associated with the related disease. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and mutation.

**Drug Response:**
