# Information about Gene KRT18

## Gene Position and Pathology

- Gene KRT18 is located on chromosome 12. 
- Mutations in this gene have been linked to several diseases, including liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

## Gene Function

- The KRT18 gene encodes a member of the type I intermediate filament chain family. 
- It is a major component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells, and is involved in maintaining cell integrity and resistance to mechanical stress.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID

- Some of the common amino acid mutations in KRT18 include V25E, R90H, E170G, E336K, G433S, and D90Y.
- These mutations can be categorized as missense mutations, where a single amino acid in the protein is substituted with a different amino acid.
- dbSNP ID: rs121913522, rs121913747, rs121913785, rs121913786, rs121913787, rs121913788

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Somatic mutations in KRT18 have been found in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer.
- dbSNP ID: rs755929955, rs267607681, rs267607679, rs267607680

## Related disease

- Mutations in KRT18 have been associated with several diseases, including liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and tumor development.
- Some specific diseases associated with KRT18 mutations include hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and atherosclerosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for diseases associated with KRT18 mutations depends on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and associated disease.
- Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with KRT18 mutations have been shown to have a poorer prognosis than those without mutations.

## Drug response

- Some experimental drugs have been shown to target KRT18-expressing cancer cells, including the compound CYT997.
