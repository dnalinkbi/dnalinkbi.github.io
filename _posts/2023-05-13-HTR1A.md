- Related disease: HTR1A gene has been associated with various psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

- Treatment and Prognosis: HTR1A gene has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for various psychiatric disorders. Several drugs that target the HTR1A receptor, such as buspirone and gepirone, have been used in the treatment of anxiety and depression.

- Drug Response: HTR1A gene polymorphisms have been associated with differential drug response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and paroxetine.
