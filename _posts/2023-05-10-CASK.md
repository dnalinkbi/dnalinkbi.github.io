# Gene CASK 

Gene CASK is located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.4. It encodes a protein known as calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase, which plays an essential role in neural development and synaptic function.

## Function
CASK is involved in the development of synapses and axon guidance in the brain. It regulates neurotransmitter release, neuronal migration, and cytoskeleton organization. It is also essential for synapse formation and plasticity in the nervous system.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CASK gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders such as X-linked intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epileptic encephalopathy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for conditions caused by mutations in the CASK gene. Treatment is generally supportive and based on the individual's symptoms and severity.

## Drug response
There is no specific drug targeted at mutations in CASK gene, but there are medications available to help manage the symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders.
