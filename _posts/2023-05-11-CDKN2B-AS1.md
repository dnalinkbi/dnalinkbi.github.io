## Gene CDKN2B-AS1
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 9p21.3. 
- **Function for gene:** CDKN2B-AS1 (also known as ANRIL) is a long non-coding RNA that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle control, proliferation, and apoptosis. It also interacts with polycomb repressive complexes to modulate epigenetic regulation of gene expression. 
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
  - HGNC: 28903
  - NCBI Entrez: 100048912
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000240498
  - OMIM: 612737
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: NA
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** No protein-coding sequence, therefore AA mutations are not applicable.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported in CDKN2B-AS1, some of which have been associated with increased risk for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. For example, rs2151280 has been linked to susceptibility to myocardial infarction.
- **Related disease:** Several diseases have been linked to variants in CDKN2B-AS1, including:
  - Cardiovascular disease
  - Type 2 diabetes
  - Cancer (e.g. melanoma, glioma, prostate cancer)
- **Treatment and prognosis:** As a non-coding RNA, CDKN2B-AS1 is not a direct therapeutic target. However, modulation of its expression could potentially impact the pathogenesis of diseases associated with variants in the gene. Further research is needed to determine the therapeutic potential of CDKN2B-AS1 modulation.
- **Drug response:** No known drug response related to variants in CDKN2B-AS1.
