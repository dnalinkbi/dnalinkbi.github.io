## Information on Gene CIRH1A

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- Gene: CIRH1A (Cirrhosis, Autosomal Recessive 1A)
- Chromosome: 16
- Pathology: Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that leads to liver failure. 
- Function: The CIRH1A gene encodes a protein known as "Cirhin" which is involved in the regulation of liver function and development.
