## Gene HAL

### Genetic Position
HAL is located on chromosome 10 at 10q23.33.

### Pathology
Mutations in HAL have been associated with an increased risk of obesity and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.

### Function
HAL encodes for the enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase which is involved in the breakdown of histidine to form urocanic acid and ammonia. It plays a vital role in amino acid metabolism.
