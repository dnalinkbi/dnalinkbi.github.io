# Information about gene ATXN8OS

## Genetic Position
The ATXN8OS gene is located on chromosome 13q21.32 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000013.11) and spans 23,275 base pairs.

## Pathology and Function
ATXN8OS is an antisense long non-coding RNA that is transcribed opposite to the sense strand containing the ATXN8 gene. The ATXN8 gene is known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects coordination and balance. The exact function of ATXN8OS is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be involved in regulating the expression of the ATXN8 gene.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 6319
- HGNC: 17910
- Ensembl: ENSG00000256750
- OMIM: 608768
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H3R0
- Aliases: ATXN8 opposite strand, SCA8 transcript, SCA8 delay-onset transcript

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
No amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for ATXN8OS. This gene is a non-coding RNA and mutations are not typically reported at the AA level.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for ATXN8OS in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
ATXN8OS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. SCA8 is caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CTG) in the ATXN8 gene, which leads to the accumulation of toxic RNA and neuronal loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for SCA8, and management of symptoms is mainly supportive. Symptoms can include gait ataxia, dysarthria, and tremors, and typically appear in midlife. Disease progression can vary widely among affected individuals.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug for the treatment of SCA8, but medications such as benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants can be used to manage symptoms such as tremors and spasticity.
