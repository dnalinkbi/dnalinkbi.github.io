# Gene PNPLA2

**Genetic Position**: The PNPLA2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.3)

**Pathology**: Mutations in the PNPLA2 gene have been found to be associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity, and insulin resistance.

**Function**: The PNPLA2 gene encodes the protein adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which is involved in the breakdown of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue. ATGL is the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis, the process by which stored fats are mobilized and broken down into fatty acids.

**External IDs**: 
- HGNC: 14126
- NCBI Entrez:  PNPLA2
- Ensembl: ENSG00000131690
- OMIM: 609059
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60906

**Aliases**: ATGL, desnutrin

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 

|AA Mutation |Mutation Type |dbSNP ID|
|-------|--------|-------|
|p.Gly142Ser |Missense |rs1758489|
|p.Arg221Cys |Missense |rs113993979|
|p.Pro237Leu |Missense |rs35744605|
|p.Ser47Leu |Missense |rs17851488|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported in dbSNP

**Related Diseases**: NAFLD, obesity, insulin resistance

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no cure for NAFLD, but lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise can help improve the condition. In some cases, medication may also be prescribed.

**Drug Response**: The PNPLA2 gene has been identified as a possible target for the treatment of NAFLD. Several drugs that target the PNPLA2 enzyme are currently in development.
