# Gene: ST8SIA5

## Genetic Position
ST8SIA5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q12) and spans 55,256 base pairs.

## Pathology and Function
ST8SIA5 encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 5, which is responsible for adding sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. It is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides. Gangliosides are important components of neuronal membranes and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and cell differentiation. Studies have suggested that reduced ST8SIA5 expression may be associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
