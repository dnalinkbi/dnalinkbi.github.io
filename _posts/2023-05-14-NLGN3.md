## Gene NLGN3
**Position:** Chromosome X (Xq13.1)
**Function:** NLGN3 (Neuroligin-3) is a synaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of synapses in the central nervous system. The gene product is required for proper neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.
**Aliases:** NL3, KIAA1482
**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 17846
- NCBI Entrez: 54413
- Ensembl: ENSG00000168484
- OMIM: 300336
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NZ94

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg451Cys (rs148963885)
- p.Arg704Cys (rs148248637)
- p.Arg704His (rs587784383)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.799C>T (rs773772413)
- c.1011dupT (rs786204169)
- c.1345A>G (rs1565851569)

**Related disease:** Mutations in NLGN3 have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for neurodevelopmental disorders caused by NLGN3 mutations. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms and may include behavioral therapy, medication, and other supportive therapies.

**Drug response:** Some studies suggest that certain drugs, such as oxytocin and arbaclofen, may improve social behavior in individuals with ASD caused by NLGN3 mutations.
