## Gene: STAG1

### Information
- **Function for gene**: STAG1 encodes a component of the cohesin complex that regulates sister chromatid cohesion through its roles in chromosome segregation, DNA replication, and DNA repair.

     - HGNC ID: 11424
     - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 9126
     - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000110269
     - Genomic Location: Chromosome Xq25
     - Aliases: KIAA0174, SCC3A, hSTAGA
