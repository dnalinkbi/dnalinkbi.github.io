## Gene NDUFS3
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 11:100,491,700-100,520,140
- **Function for gene**: NDUFS3 encodes a subunit of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, which is the first and largest complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex is essential for electron transfer and energy production.

  - Ensembl: ENSG00000110370
  - OMIM: 603846
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O75489

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
  - c.131C>T (p.Arg44Ter), rs398122878

  - c.973G>A (p.Arg325His), rs104894450

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.

- **Related disease**: NDUFS3 variants have been implicated in mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a genetic condition affecting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, muscle weakness, neuropathy, and lactic acidosis. 

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for mitochondrial complex I deficiency is generally supportive, focusing on treating the symptoms. There is no cure for this condition. The prognosis can vary widely depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

- **Drug response**: There are currently no specific drugs available for the treatment of mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Some patients may benefit from the use of vitamins and supplements, including coenzyme Q10 and riboflavin.
