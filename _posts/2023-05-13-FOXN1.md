# Gene FOXN1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: 17q11.2
- Cytogenetic band: q11.2
- Genomic coordinates: NC_000017.11:g.28368467_28408350

## Pathology and Function
- FOXN1 gene encodes for a transcription factor called forkhead box N1.
- It plays a crucial role in thymus development and location early in fetal development.
- Mutations in FOXN1 can lead to a rare autosomal recessive disorder called the nude/SCID syndrome.
- In this syndrome, affected individuals have an absent or severely impaired thymus, which leads to compromised immune system function.
- In mice, the Foxn1 gene regulates hair morphogenesis, and mutations in this gene lead to alopecia and hair follicle abnormalities.

## Related Disease
- Nude/SCID syndrome (OMIM: 601693)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for nude/SCID syndrome.
- Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and associated infections.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the individual's immune system impairment.

## Drug Response
- There is no known specific drug response for nude/SCID syndrome.
