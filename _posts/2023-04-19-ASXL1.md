# Information about gene ASXL1

## Gene information
- Function for gene: ASXL1 acts as a transcriptional regulator by altering chromatin structure and interacting with other proteins involved in gene expression. It is also involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation.
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 171023
    - Genomic location: chromosome 20, 20q11.21
    - Aliases: BOD, KIAA1706, MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome 1, ASX-like protein 1

- External sites:
	- HGNC: HGNC:28924
	- NCBI Entrez: 171023
	- Ensembl: ENSG00000184073
	- OMIM: 612990
	- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NHC4

## Mutations
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
	- The most common ASXL1 mutations occur in the C-terminal region of the protein and include frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations.
	- dbSNP ID: rs142971849, rs121434550, rs117635553, rs119877632

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - ASXL1 mutations have been found in a variety of myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
    - dbSNP ID: rs142971849, rs121434550, rs117635553, rs119877632

## Related disease
- ASXL1 mutations have been associated with the development of various myeloid malignancies, including MDS, CMML, and AML.
- MDS is a group of disorders characterized by abnormal blood cell production leading to anemia, infections, and bleeding. CMML is a rare blood cancer that affects white blood cells and their precursors. AML is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow and can spread to other parts of the body.

## Treatment and prognosis
- ASXL1 mutations have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with MDS and AML. However, specific treatment for ASXL1 mutations is not yet available, and treatment options typically include chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, and supportive care.

## Drug response
- There is limited information on drug response specific to ASXL1 mutations. However, some studies have suggested that ASXL1 mutations may affect the response to certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as azacitidine and decitabine.
