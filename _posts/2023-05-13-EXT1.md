# Gene: EXT1

**Function:** 

The EXT1 gene encodes an enzyme called exostosin glycosyltransferase 1, which is involved in heparin sulfate biosynthesis. Heparin sulfate plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of growth factors, cell signaling, and cell adhesion.

**External IDs:**

- NCBI Entrez Gene: 2131
- Ensembl: ENSG00000128274
- OMIM: 608177
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16394

**Aliases:**

- Exostosin-1
- Glucosaminyltransferase EXT1

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

Information on amino acid mutations and dbSNP IDs for EXT1 is not currently available.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

Information on somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs for EXT1 is not currently available.

**Related Disease:**

Mutations in EXT1 have been associated with a number of skeletal disorders, such as hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), diaphyseal dysplasia, and pseudoachondroplasia. HMO is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple bony tumors on the surface of bones, particularly in the long bones of the limbs.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is currently no cure for HMO, but treatment options include surgical removal of the growths and physical therapy to improve joint mobility. The prognosis for HMO is generally good, with most patients able to lead normal lives with proper management of their symptoms.

**Drug Response:**

Information on drug response related to EXT1 is not currently available.
