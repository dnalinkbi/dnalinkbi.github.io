## Gene NR1H2

- **Function:** NR1H2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 2) encodes a transcription factor that is involved in regulating the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. It plays a key role in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis.

- **External IDs:**
    - Gene ID: 7376
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 19:5,835,388-5,875,441
    - Aliases: LXR-beta, LXRB, NR1H2A

- **AA Mutation List:**

|Mutation Type|AA Change|dbSNP ID|
|-------------|---------|--------|
|Missense|Lys160Gln|rs137853774|
|Missense|Ser289Leu|rs140020480|
|Missense|Ile259Thr|rs76361201|

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported as of now.

- **Related Disease:** NR1H2 has been associated with various diseases related to metabolic homeostasis, such as atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The role of NR1H2 in various diseases makes it a potential therapeutic target. However, more research is required to develop effective drugs targeting NR1H2. 

- **Drug Response:** Studies have shown that selective agonists of NR1H2 (LXR-beta) can increase cholesterol efflux and reduce atherosclerosis in mice. Also, agonists of NR1H2 have been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines in animal models of inflammatory diseases.
