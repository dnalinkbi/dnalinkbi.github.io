# Gene CXCR4

## Genetic Position
The CXCR4 gene is located on the human chromosome 2q22.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CXCR4 gene have been associated with WHIM syndrome, a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis.

## Function
The CXCR4 gene codes for a chemokine receptor that plays a critical role in immune responses and hematopoiesis. It binds to the chemokine CXCL12 and regulates lymphocyte homing, stem cell mobilization, and vascular development.

## Related Disease
WHIM syndrome, which stands for warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Symptomatic treatment and prophylactic antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy for WHIM syndrome. There is no definitive cure for the disorder.

## Drug Response
Several treatments have been proposed for WHIM syndrome, including plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist that increases neutrophil counts and reduces infections.
