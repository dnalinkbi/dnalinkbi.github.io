# Gene: ATXN8

## Genetic Position

- ATXN8 is located on chromosome 13q21.32
- It spans approximately 29.7 kilobases (kb)

## Pathology

- ATXN8 is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8)
- Increased repetition of CTG triplet in ATXN8 is the cause of SCA8

## Function

- ATXN8 is involved in the regulation of RNA transcription, splicing, and translation
