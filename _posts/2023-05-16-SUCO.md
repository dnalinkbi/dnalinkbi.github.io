## Information About Gene SUCO 

### Genetic Position 
The gene SUCO (succinate-CoA ligase, GDP-forming, beta subunit) is located on the p arm of chromosome 13 at position 14.11, from base pair 23,639,554 to base pair 23,643,121. 

### Pathology 
Mutations in the SUCO gene have been associated with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in several studies.

### Function 
The SUCO gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS). This enzyme is involved in cellular metabolism, specifically in the citric acid cycle where it catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA and an inorganic phosphate to succinate and CoA. Additionally, SCS is also involved in ketone body metabolism.

### Treatment and Prognosis 
Treatment for metabolic disorders caused by mutations in SUCO is supportive and focused on symptom management. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and individual response to therapy.

### Drug Response 
There is limited information available on drug response specifically related to SUCO mutations.
