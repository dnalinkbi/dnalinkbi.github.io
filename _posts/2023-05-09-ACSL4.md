# Gene ACSL4

ACSL4 gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq22.1) and encodes for the Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4. This gene is also known as FACL4 (Fatty Acid CoA Ligase 4) and ACS4.

## Function
ACSL4 is involved in the activation of long-chain fatty acids to their CoA derivatives. These activated fatty acids can then be utilized for several metabolic processes including energy production, biosynthesis of complex lipids, and regulation of gene expression.

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for ACSL4 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Sjogren-Larsson syndrome: A rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin abnormalities, intellectual disability, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. This disorder is caused by a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), which is involved in the metabolism of long-chain fatty alcohols. Mutations in ACSL4 gene have been reported in some cases of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is mainly supportive and involves the treatment of specific symptoms. There is no cure for this disorder. Physical therapy and mobility aids may be required for the treatment of spasticity.

## Drug Response
No drug has been specifically approved for the treatment of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. However, various drugs can be used for the management of specific symptoms of the disease.
