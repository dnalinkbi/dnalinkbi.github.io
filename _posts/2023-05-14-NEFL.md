# Gene: NEFL
## Information
- **Position**: Chromosome 8, location 8p21.2
- **Pathology**: NEFL is associated with various neuronal disorders including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
- **Function**: NEFL encodes for the neurofilament light polypeptide, which is a component of the neuronal cytoskeleton involved in axonal growth and maintenance.
