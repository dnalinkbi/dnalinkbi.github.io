# Information about gene PRODH

## Genetic Position and Pathology
The PRODH gene is located on chromosome 22q11.21. Mutations in this gene are associated with hyperprolinemia type I, which is characterized by an overproduction of the amino acid proline. This can lead to neurological symptoms, including seizures, developmental delays, and intellectual disability.

## Function for gene
The PRODH gene encodes the enzyme proline dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of proline. This enzyme is important for maintaining proper levels of proline in the body.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the PRODH gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the PRODH gene are associated with hyperprolinemia type I, which can cause neurological symptoms as mentioned before.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for hyperprolinemia type I involves controlling intake of proline in the diet and may include anticonvulsant medication for seizure control. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There are currently no known specific drug responses associated with mutations in the PRODH gene.
