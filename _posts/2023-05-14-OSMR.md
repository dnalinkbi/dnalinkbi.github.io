# Gene OSMR

## Gene information
- Function: The OSMR gene encodes for the subunit of the receptor for interleukin 6 family of cytokines. It plays a crucial role in the signaling pathway of various cytokines, including OSM (Oncostatin M), LIF (Leukemia inhibitory factor) and IL-31 (Interleukin 31). 

- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID (NCBI): 9180 
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 5q31.3 
    - Aliases: IL-31 receptor subunit alpha, Oncostatin M receptor subunit alpha

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: There are multiple missense mutations reported in the OSMR gene, including p.Gly201Asp (dbSNP ID: rs143932282), p.Ala225Glu (dbSNP ID: rs757370762), and p.Arg534Gly (dbSNP ID: rs373142222).

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: There are somatic mutations reported in the OSMR gene in various cancer types, including ovarian cancer and lung cancer.

- Related disease: Dysregulated OSMR signaling has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration.

- Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there are no specific treatments targeted at OSMR. However, targeting the cytokines that signal through OSMR, such as OSM and IL-31, has shown promising results in preclinical studies.

- Drug response: Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor, has been used to target OSMR signaling in certain cancers.
