# Information on Gene AKAP9

## Genetic Position
The AKAP9 gene is located on chromosome 7 at the location 7q21.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the AKAP9 gene have been associated with various diseases including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma.

## Function
The AKAP9 gene encodes for A-kinase anchor protein 9, which acts as a scaffold protein for the localization and regulation of different signaling pathways within cells. It is also involved in spindle assembly during mitosis.
