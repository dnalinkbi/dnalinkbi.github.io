# Information about the gene TMCO1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
* **Genetic position**: Chromosome 1, q32.1.
* **Pathology**: TMCO1 mutations have been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
* **Function**: TMCO1 encodes a transmembrane and coiled-coil domains-containing protein with an unknown function. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the eye.

## Gene Information
* **Function for gene**: Unknown.
* **External IDs**: 
  * Gene ID: 149111
  * Genomic location: NC_000001.11:g.205305244_205313763
  * Aliases: C1orf37
* **External sites**:
  * HGNC: 21561
  * NCBI Entrez: 149111
  * Ensembl: ENSG00000116748
  * OMIM: 614041
  * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NBZ2

## Mutations
* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
  * p.Gln40Ter (stop-gain) rs796065035
  * p.Arg45His (missense) rs150929059
  * p.Leu566Val (missense) rs769037642
* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.

## Related Disease
* **Disease**: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
* **Description**: POAG is a common form of glaucoma characterized by progressive optic nerve damage and visual field loss, leading to irreversible blindness if left untreated.
* **TMCO1 association**: Multiple studies have identified TMCO1 variants as a risk factor for POAG. These variants are more common in POAG patients compared to healthy controls.

## Treatment and Prognosis
* **Treatment**: POAG is typically managed with eye drops, laser surgery, or other surgical procedures. There is currently no cure for the disease.
* **Prognosis**: Prognosis for POAG depends on the timeliness of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment. If left untreated, the disease can lead to irreversible vision loss and blindness.

## Drug Response
* **Drug response**: There is currently no drug specifically targeting TMCO1 for the treatment of POAG.
