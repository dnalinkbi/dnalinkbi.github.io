# Gene information for KAT6A

## Gene Position, Pathology and Function
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 8, position 120,935,359-121,007,103
- **Function for gene:** KAT6A encodes for lysine acetyltransferase 6A which is involved in histone acetylation and gene transcription regulation
- **Pathology:** Mutations in this gene have been associated with developmental disorders including intellectual disability and Kabuki syndrome
- **Aliases:** MOZ, MYST3, KAT6A

## Related Disease
Kabuki syndrome, intellectual disability, and various developmental disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Kabuki syndrome or intellectual disability caused by KAT6A mutations. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeting KAT6A mutations. However, studies have suggested that epigenetic modifying drugs such as HDAC inhibitors may be a potential treatment option.
