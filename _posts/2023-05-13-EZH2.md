# Gene EZH2

## Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 7, q36.1
- **Pathology:** Overexpression has been associated with several malignant tumors, including lymphomas and solid tumors.
- **Function:** Encodes the protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2. It is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase that is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 3520
    - NCBI Entrez: 2146
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000101373
    - OMIM: 601573
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15910

- **Related disease:** Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Breast cancer, Prostate cancer, Bladder cancer, Colon cancer, Gastric cancer, Pancreatic cancer.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Inhibiting EZH2 has been explored as a therapeutic strategy for various cancer types. However, further research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of EZH2 inhibitors as cancer treatment.
- **Drug response:** Tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) is a small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 that has shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma.
