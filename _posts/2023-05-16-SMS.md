## Information about gene SMS

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 3q25.1

**Function for gene:** The gene SMS encodes for the enzyme Spermine synthase, which is involved in the metabolism of polyamines. These polyamines are important for cellular growth and differentiation.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
- HGNC ID: 11178
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 6632
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000114548
- OMIM ID: 313020
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P52788
- Aliases: SPMSPM synthase

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several mutations reported in the SMS gene, including nonsynonymous substitutions, splice site mutations and frameshift mutations. Some of the mutations with their dbSNP IDs are as follows:
- c.332G>A (p.Arg111His) rs61753964
- c.496A>G (p.Tyr166Cys) rs121908820
- c.698C>T (p.Pro233Ser) rs121908821

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** The somatic variations including SNVs and InDels in SMS gene are not well studied.

**Related disease:** Mutations in the SMS gene are associated with Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), a rare X-linked intellectual disability syndrome characterized by skeletal abnormalities, osteoporosis, and speech and behavioral abnormalities.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for Snyder-Robinson syndrome. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life of the patient.

**Drug response:** There is no approved drug therapy for Snyder-Robinson syndrome. Various drugs such as Bisphosphonates and Vitamin D supplements are used to treat the symptoms of the disease, but their effectiveness is not well established.
