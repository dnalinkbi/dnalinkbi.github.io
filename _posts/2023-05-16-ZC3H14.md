# Gene: ZC3H14

### Genetic Position
ZC3H14 is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q24.31.

### Pathology
Mutations in the ZC3H14 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability, progressive spastic paraplegia, and peripheral neuropathy. 

### Function
ZC3H14 encodes a protein that is involved in RNA metabolism and is essential for neuronal development. The protein also plays a role in the regulation of mRNA translation and has been implicated in the degradation of mRNAs containing premature stop codons.
