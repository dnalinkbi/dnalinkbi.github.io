## Gene MTAP 

MTAP (Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase) is a gene located on chromosome 9p21.3. The MTAP gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds, including polyamines and methionine. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible cleavage of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA). When the MTAP gene is absent or inactive, MTA accumulates, leading to the dysregulation of putative oncogenic signaling pathways, including activated proliferation of cancer cells. 

### Function for gene
The MTAP gene encodes the MTAP enzyme, which metabolizes sulfur-containing compounds and plays a critical role in transmethylation reactions and polyamine metabolism. Polyamines modulate many biological processes, including DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis. Loss of MTAP expression increases intracellular MTA levels, leading to changes in polyamine metabolism. The MTAP promoter region can regulate the expression of key polyamine biosynthetic genes.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
MTAP has a low mutation frequency in cancer. However, several somatic mutations of the MTAP gene have been reported. Using cBioPortal database, we found that 4.1% of patients with solid tumors have MTAP gene alteration. Many of these mutations are missense mutation. Here are several single nucleotide variations of MTAP gene:
- p.L67S (rs10748643)
- p.M55V (rs13194436)
- p.R44L (rs35971518)
- p.C80F (rs139733327)
- p.I73V (rs139194509)
- p.T42S (rs150062662)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
MTAP somatic mutations are often found with concurrent co-deletion and co-inactivation with the CDKN2A gene on chromosome 9p21.3, especially in malignant mesothelioma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Co-deletion of CDKN2A and MTAP often results in poor survival outcomes. dbSNP has many somatic SNVs and InDels that have been reported in MTAP gene ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/?term=MTAP%5BGene%20Name%5D%20AND%20%22somatic%22%5BProperties%5D).)

### Related disease
Studies have shown that the loss of MTAP gene expression is associated with the occurrence and progression of various types of tumors, such as mesothelioma, glioblastoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. 

### Treatment and prognosis
MTAP gene deletion or inactivation can lead to increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, such as pemetrexed, which is used to treat mesothelioma. In contrast, in cancer cells that retain MTAP function, the enzyme can potentially activate prodrugs such as 5-fluorocytosine.

### Drug response
MTAP gene alterations such as deletion or inactivation in cancer can serve as a predictive biomarker for drug-responsiveness to various therapeutic agents such as pemetrexed, decitabine and thioguanine.
