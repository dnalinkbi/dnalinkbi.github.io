# Information about Gene TPM4

## Genetic Position 
TPM4 gene is located on chromosome 19 at position p13.2

## Pathology 
Mutations in TPM4 can cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, leading to heart failure.

## Function for Gene
TPM4 encodes a protein called tropomyosin 4, which is an actin-binding protein that is involved in muscle contraction.

## Related Diseases
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for DCM includes medications to reduce symptoms, such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and in some cases, surgery may be necessary. The prognosis for DCM varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individual case.

## Drug Response
There are currently no specific drugs that target TPM4 mutations in DCM. However, some medications used to treat heart failure, such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, may also help improve symptoms in individuals with DCM caused by TPM4 mutations.
