# Gene Information on PKN3

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: PKN3 (Protein kinase N3) is located on chromosome 19q13.2. 

- **Pathology**: Mutations in PKN3 are associated with various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.

- **Function**: PKN3 encodes for a serine/threonine kinase protein that regulates various cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation, and migration. Additionally, PKN3 is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.

## Gene Details

- **Function for gene**: PKN3 encodes for a serine/threonine kinase protein that regulates various cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation, and migration. Additionally, PKN3 is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.
