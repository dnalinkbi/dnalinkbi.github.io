# Genetic information for AGL gene

## Gene Overview
The AGL gene encodes the glycogen debranching enzyme. This gene is found on the long arm of chromosome 1 at location 1p21.

## Function for gene
The AGL gene encodes the glycogen debranching enzyme which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism by mediating the release of glucose from glycogen. This enzyme also helps in breaking down glycogen in the lysosomes.

## Related disease
Deficiency of glycogen debranching enzyme causes the glycogen storage disease type III. This disease is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in the liver and muscles.

## Treatment and prognosis
Management of glycogen storage disease type III includes dietary restriction of fats, continuous glucose infusion, liver transplantation, and enzyme replacement therapy. Prognosis is generally moderate but varies based on age of onset and severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
There is limited evidence on drug response in patients with glycogen storage disease type III.
