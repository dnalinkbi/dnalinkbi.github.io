# Gene: DMP1

## Information

- **Function for gene**: The DMP1 gene encodes a multifunctional phosphoprotein that is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family and is involved in bone and dentin mineralization.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: HGNC: 2920; NCBI Entrez: 1760; Ensembl: ENSG00000115253; OMIM: 600980; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35462
- **External sites are HGNC, NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, OMIM, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Several missense mutations have been reported in the DMP1 gene, such as p.Arg52Trp with dbSNP ID rs121908338 and p.Thr188Met with dbSNP ID rs121908337.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There is no reported somatic mutation for DMP1 in dbSNP.
- **Related disease**: Mutations in the DMP1 gene have been associated with different forms of inherited diseases, such as autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) 1B and 1C, and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR).
- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for hypophosphatemic rickets includes phosphate and vitamin D supplementation. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.
- **Drug response**: There is no known drug specifically targeting DMP1 gene variant. The treatment usually consists of generic medication of vitamin D and phosphate supplement.
