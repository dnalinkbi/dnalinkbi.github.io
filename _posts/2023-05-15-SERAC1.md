## Gene SERAC1
- **Genetic position:** The SERAC1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.1).
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the SERAC1 gene have been associated with disorders of mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, including 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III and optic atrophy.
- **Function:** The SERAC1 protein is involved in lipid metabolism and is required for the synthesis and maintenance of mitochondrial phospholipids.
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 30020
    - NCBI Entrez: 79022
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000198126
    - OMIM: 614725
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9GZN9
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Some of the reported mutations in the SERAC1 gene and their dbSNP IDs are:

|Mutation|dbSNP ID|Mutation type|
|--------|--------|-------------|
|p.Glu227Lys|rs121965052|Missense|
|p.Arg230*|rs758200881|Nonsense|

|p.Met552Val|rs12566287|Missense|
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Currently, there is no information available on somatic SNVs/InDels in SERAC1.
- **Related diseases:** Mutations in the SERAC1 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
    - 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type III (OMIM# 258501)
    - Optic atrophy (OMIM# 165500)
    - Leigh syndrome (OMIM# 256000)
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options for SERAC1-associated disorders are limited and primarily supportive. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and its response to treatment.
- **Drug response:** Currently, there is no specific drug available for the treatment of SERAC1-associated disorders.
