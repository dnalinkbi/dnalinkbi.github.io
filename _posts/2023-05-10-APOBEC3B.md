# Information about gene APOBEC3B

## Genetic Position 
- The APOBEC3B gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 13.1. 

## Pathology and Function 
- APOBEC3B encodes for a protein that belongs to the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like family. 
- It plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by inhibiting the replication of retroviruses and other viruses.
- Overexpression of APOBEC3B has been linked to various diseases, including cancer such as breast cancer.
- The protein encoded by APOBEC3B functions as a cytidine deaminase and can cause somatic mutations in the genome as it binds to single-stranded DNA and contributes to the evolution and adaptation of tumors.
