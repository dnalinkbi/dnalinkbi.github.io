# Gene: SCN10A

### 1. Function for gene
SCN10A gene encodes a protein called sodium channel alpha subunit 10. This protein is involved in the generation and transmission of electrical signals in nerve cells and muscle cells. It plays a crucial role in pain sensation and impulse conduction in the heart. 

### 2. External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- Gene ID: 6331
- Genomic location: Chromosome 3q21.1
- Aliases: Nav1.8

### 3. External sites
- HGNC: 10530
- NCBI Entrez: 6331
- Ensembl: ENSG00000118137
- OMIM: 604427
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5Y9

### 4. AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg1268Cys (rs143995934)
- p.Arg1268His (rs143995901)
- p.Arg1309His (rs137852676)

### 5. Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in the SCN10A gene.

### 6. Related disease
Mutations in the SCN10A gene have been associated with various diseases such as primary erythromelalgia (PE), small fiber neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation.

### 7. Treatment and prognosis
There is no specific treatment for SCN10A-related diseases, and the prognosis varies depending on the severity and type of disease.

### 8. Drug response
Some studies suggest that SCN10A variants may affect the response to certain drugs, such as lidocaine and mexiletine. Lidocaine and mexiletine are commonly used to treat pain and heart conditions.
