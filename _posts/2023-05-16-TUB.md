## Information about gene TUB

### Genetic Position
The TUB gene is located on chromosome 12q13.12.

### Pathology
The TUB gene is associated with different types of cancer, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer.

### Function
The TUB gene encodes a member of the tubulin superfamily that forms the principal component of microtubules. Microtubules are responsible for numerous cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and cell motility.

- **Ensembl ID**: ENSG00000196411
- **OMIM ID**: 191110
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P07437
- **Aliases**: TUBA, TUBA6

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- None reported.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- None reported.

### Related Diseases
- Breast Cancer
- Hepatocellular Carcinoma
- Colorectal Cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment varies depending on the specific type and stage of cancer, but standard treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Treatment can often improve prognosis or even lead to remission.
- Prognosis for cancers involving TUB gene mutations varies widely but tends to be poor if the cancer is advanced and/or if metastasis has occurred.

### Drug Response
- None reported.
