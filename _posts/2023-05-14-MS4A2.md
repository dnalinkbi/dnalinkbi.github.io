# MS4A2 Gene Information

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

### Gene Position

- **MS4A2** gene is located on chromosome 16q12.2.

### Gene Pathology

- Mutations in **MS4A2** gene have been associated with various hypersensitivity reactions including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema.
- The gene is also known to be involved in cancer, particularly in pancreatic cancer.

### Gene Function

- The **MS4A2** gene encodes for a protein called Mast cell-specific receptor 1 (also known as FceRII, CD23 antigen, or cluster of differentiation 23).
- This protein is mainly expressed in mast cells, which are involved in allergic and inflammatory responses.
- The function of this protein is to bind to immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which triggers a signal cascade that leads to mast cell activation and release of various mediators that participate in the aforementioned responses.

## Other Gene Information

- Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000104184
- OMIM: 147140
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P06734
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 16q12.2
- Aliases: FCE2, CD23, CVID4

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- p.Arg150His (rs144158603): A missense mutation that has been associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma.
- p.Val207Met (rs1061237): Another missense mutation that has been linked to allergic rhinitis and asthma risk.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- None reported.

### Related Disease

- Asthma
- Allergic rhinitis
- Eczema
- Pancreatic cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no cure for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema, but these conditions can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes.
- Pancreatic cancer treatment usually involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
- Prognosis for these conditions vary based on various factors such as disease severity and response to treatment.

### Drug Response

- Several drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies and anti-inflammatory agents, have been developed to target the function of the Mast cell-specific receptor 1 protein, and some of these drugs are currently used in the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases.
