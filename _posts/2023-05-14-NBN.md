# Information about gene NBN

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 8p11.2

**Function for Gene NBN**: The NBN gene encodes a protein called nibrin, which is a component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBN complex. This complex is involved in DNA damage repair, cell cycle checkpoint activation, and homologous recombination.

**External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases**: 
- HGNC: 7805 
- NCBI Entrez: 4683
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104424
- OMIM: 602667
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14448

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 

There are several mutations that have been identified in the NBN gene. Some of the most common are:

- c.657_661del5 (p.K219Sfs*7) - frameshift mutation, rs80357303
- c.2800G>A (p.E934K) - missense mutation, rs1805794
- c.1093G>C (p.E365D) - missense mutation, rs14448

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are several somatic mutations that have been identified in the NBN gene, including:

- c.2800G>A (p.E934K) - missense mutation, rs1805794
- c.718C>T (p.T240I) - missense mutation, rs730880613

**Related Disease**: Mutations in the NBN gene have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)
- Breast cancer
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment options for NBS and related diseases depend on the specific symptoms and complications. Prognosis also varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

**Drug Response**: Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting the NBN gene or related diseases.
