## Gene: SLC40A1

### Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 2 (2q32.2)
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene are associated with hemochromatosis type 4 (also known as ferroportin disease), which is characterized by abnormal accumulation of iron in multiple organs including the liver, pancreas, and heart.
- **Function:** The SLC40A1 gene encodes the protein ferroportin, which is responsible for exporting iron from cells and is necessary for regulating iron homeostasis in the body.
- **Aliases:** FPN1, MST077, IREG1

### External IDs

- **HGNC:** 10903
- **NCBI Entrez:** 30061
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000120217
- **OMIM:** 606069
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q9NP59

### Mutations

- **AA mutation list:** There are several mutations identified in the SLC40A1 gene associated with hemochromatosis type 4. Some examples include:
    - R178Q
    - G80S
    - V162del
- **Mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (InDels) are the most common mutations associated with hemochromatosis type 4. Some examples include:
    - rs11568318 (c.532G>A, p.R178Q)
    - rs11568320 (c.239C>T, p.G80S)
    - rs121908001 (c.485_487delTTC, p.V162del)

### Related Disease

- **Disease name:** Hemochromatosis Type 4 (Ferroportin Disease)
- **Mode of inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
- **Clinical features:** Abnormal accumulation of iron in organs including liver, pancreas, and heart, leading to cirrhosis, diabetes, and heart failure in severe cases.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Management of hemochromatosis type 4 includes regular monitoring of iron levels and phlebotomy (bloodletting) to reduce iron overload. In some cases, iron chelation therapy may be used to remove excess iron. Prognosis for hemochromatosis type 4 is variable depending on the severity of iron overload and adequacy of treatment.

### Drug Response

- The effectiveness of iron chelation therapy may depend on the specific mutation in SLC40A1. Studies have shown that some mutations may respond differently to different chelating agents.
