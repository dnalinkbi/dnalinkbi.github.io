# Genetic Information Analysis Report on GABRR2 Gene

## Introduction
GABRR2 is a human gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 at position 6q15. The gene encodes for the Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-2 protein.
 
## Function 
The protein encoded by GABRR2 gene is a member of the ligand-gated ionic channel family. It is involved in the synaptic transmission of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. 

## External IDs and Aliases

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000112229
- OMIM ID: 137162
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8N1C3
- Aliases: GABRR2, GABA-œÅ2 receptor subunit

## AA mutation list and mutation types with dbSNP ID
There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in the GABRR2 gene. The following are the missense mutations reported in the gene along with the dbSNP ID.

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R46L | Missense | rs376255544 |
| R307C | Missense | rs758911005 |
| E352K | Missense | rs730880878 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for GABRR2 gene.

## Related Diseases
Studies have reported an association of GABRR2 gene with various diseases like autism, schizophrenia, and alcoholism. However, the exact nature of the association is not yet clearly understood.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known treatment or cure for GABRR2 gene-associated diseases. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life of affected individuals.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs specifically targeting GABRR2 gene function. However, drugs targeting the GABA receptor system, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, are used to treat the symptoms of the associated diseases.
