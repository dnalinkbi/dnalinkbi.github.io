## Information about Gene ACSM3

### Genetic Position
ACSM3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q13.2. The gene spans approximately 94.8 kilobases.

### Pathology
There are currently no known pathological associations with ACSM3 mutations. 

### Function
ACSM3 encodes a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into acyl-CoA molecules. Specifically, ACSM3 is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid.
