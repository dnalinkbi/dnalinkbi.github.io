## Information about gene SYCP3

### Genetic Position and Alias

- Gene: SYCP3 (Synaptonemal Complex Protein 3)
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 12q23.3
- Alias: COR1, HOP1, SPGF11

### Function of gene SYCP3

- SYCP3 plays a significant role in the synaptonemal complex formation.
- It regulates chromosome synapsis and recombination during meiosis.
- It is essential for proper homologous chromosome pairing and segregation.
- SYCP3 also has a role in the DNA repair mechanism and participates in the spindle checkpoint.
