# ALG13 gene

## Function

The ALG13 gene encodes an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which is involved in protein glycosylation and modification. Specifically, ALG13 is a subunit of the enzyme complex that catalyzes the addition of the first N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue to the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursor of N-linked glycoproteins. This process is critical for the proper folding and function of glycoproteins and mutations in ALG13 can disrupt this process, leading to various disorders.

ALG13 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q31.3).

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several known mutations in ALG13 that are associated with different disorders. Some examples include:

- p.Ala223Pro: This missense mutation is associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation type IId (CDG-IId). dbSNP ID: rs121909428.
- p.Arg241Cys: This missense mutation is also associated with CDG-IId. dbSNP ID: rs121909429.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in ALG13.

## Related Disease

Mutations in ALG13 are associated with several different types of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), including:

- CDG-IId
- CDG-IIe
- CDG-IIk

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for CDG, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and complications associated with the disorder. This may include dietary changes, physical and occupational therapy, and medications to control seizures or infections. The prognosis for individuals with CDG varies depending on the specific type and severity of the disorder.

## Drug Response

There are currently no known drugs that specifically target mutations in ALG13.
