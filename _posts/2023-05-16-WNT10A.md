# Information about Gene WNT10A

## Genetic Position
The gene WNT10A is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 35.1. It spans 31,729 base pairs and is located from base pair 212,162,712 to 212,194,441.

## Pathology and Function
WNT10A is a member of the wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) gene family, which plays a key role in embryonic development and cell differentiation. The WNT signaling pathway is involved in regulating cell fate, proliferation, and migration. WNT10A is specifically involved in the development of hair, teeth, and nails.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the WNT10A gene can lead to various ectodermal dysplasias, which are a group of genetic disorders that affect the development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. These diseases include odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia and Sch√∂pf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for ectodermal dysplasias is mainly symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis varies depending on the specific type of ectodermal dysplasia and the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug treatment available for ectodermal dysplasias caused by mutations in WNT10A. However, some symptoms may be managed with medications, such as artificial tears for dry eyes.
