# Gene SSX7

## Genetic Position:
The gene SSX7 is located on chromosome X at the position Xp11.23.

## Pathology:
The SSX7 gene is not associated with any particular pathology on its own, but it is a member of the synovial sarcoma X (SSX) family of genes. Synovial sarcomas are malignant soft tissue tumors that occur primarily in young adults.

## Function:
The function of the SSX7 gene is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 11360
- NCBI Entrez: 6757
- Ensembl: ENSG00000147120
- OMIM: 300602
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UQ90

Aliases: CT5.7, SSX9

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
No AA mutations are currently listed for the SSX7 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified for the SSX7 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease:
As a member of the SSX gene family, the SSX7 gene is associated with synovial sarcoma, a soft tissue tumor.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for synovial sarcoma can vary depending on the location and extent of the tumor. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

## Drug Response:
There is limited information available on drug response for synovial sarcoma, and specifically how the SSX7 gene may impact drug efficacy.
