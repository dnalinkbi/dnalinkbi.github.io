# Gene KDR

## Genetic Position 
The gene KDR is located on chromosome 4 at the position 4q12.

## Pathology
KDR is associated with pathological conditions like cancer, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.

## Function 
KDR is an endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. It binds to vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and stimulates signaling pathways that promote the growth and survival of endothelial cells.

## Related disease
KDR mutations have been associated with cancer, particularly breast, lung, and renal cell carcinomas, and also with hypertensive disorders, cerebral cavernous malformations, and coronary artery disease.

## Treatment and prognosis
Targeted therapies that inhibit KDR signaling, such as monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors, are being developed for the treatment of cancer and other diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis. The prognosis for patients with KDR-related diseases depends on the specific condition and stage at diagnosis.

## Drug response 
Inhibitors of KDR signaling, such as bevacizumab and sorafenib, have shown efficacy in the treatment of cancer and other diseases characterized by aberrant angiogenesis.
