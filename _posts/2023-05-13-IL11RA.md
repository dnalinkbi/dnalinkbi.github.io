## Gene IL11RA

### Genomic Position

The gene IL11RA (Interleukin 11 receptor subunit alpha) is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 at position 9p13.3. 

### Pathology and Function

The IL11RA gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the receptor for interleukin-11 (IL-11), a cytokine that plays a role in several biological processes, including hematopoiesis, immune response, and embryo development. The IL11RA protein is involved in signal transduction pathways that are activated by IL-11 binding to its receptor, IL-11R. Mutations in IL11RA have been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma.

### Gene Information

- Aliases: IL-11 receptor subunit alpha, GP130-LIKE receptor, interleukin-11 receptor subunit alpha precursor, CDw136, PNR

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

No amino acid (AA) mutation has been found for IL11RA.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for IL11RA.

### Related disease

Mutations in the IL11RA gene have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for IBD or asthma, but treatments include medications to control inflammation and reduce symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with IBD and asthma varies depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's response to treatment.

### Drug response

Research has suggested that IL-11 and its receptor may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in IBD and other inflammatory diseases.
