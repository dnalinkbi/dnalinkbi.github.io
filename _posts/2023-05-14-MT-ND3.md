# Gene: MT-ND3

## Information
- **Genetic position:** MT-ND3 is a gene located in the mitochondrial genome.
- **Pathology:** MT-ND3 mutations have been associated with several mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.
- **Function:** The MT-ND3 gene encodes for subunit 3 of NADH dehydrogenase, which is a part of the electron transport chain in the mitochondria.
