# Information on gene SNORD116@

## Genetic Position
- SNORD116@ gene is located on chromosome 15.
- It is present on the q11.2 region of chromosome 15, from position 20,167,095 to 20,168,305.

## Pathology
- SNORD116@ gene is linked to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetic disorder characterized by obesity, hypotonia, hyperphagia, intellectual disability, and hypogonadism.
- Studies have suggested that a deletion within the q11.2 region of chromosome 15, including SNORD116@ gene, is the major cause of PWS.

## Function
- SNORD116@ gene produces small nucleolar RNAs which regulate splicing, translation and other RNA processes.
