## Gene TPK1 Information

### Genetic Position

The TPK1 gene is located on chromosome 6q21.

### Pathology

Mutations in the TPK1 gene have been associated with a type of autosomal recessive ataxia called spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1).

### Function

The TPK1 gene encodes for thiamine pyrophosphokinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form of thiamine. TPP is required for the proper function of several enzymes involved in energy metabolism.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported missense mutations in the TPK1 gene associated with SCAN1:

- p.Asp230Asn (rs80338920)
- p.Arg109His (rs281864338)
- p.Asp15Asn (rs145039430)
- p.Pro98Leu (rs267607023)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the TPK1 gene.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the TPK1 gene have been associated with the development of spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1).

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no known cure for SCAN1. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms through physical therapy, mobility aids, and medications such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants. Prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of symptoms and the age of onset.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known targeted drug therapy for the treatment of SCAN1.
