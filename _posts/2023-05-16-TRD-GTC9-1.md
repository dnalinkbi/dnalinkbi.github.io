# Information about gene TRD-GTC9-1

## Genetic Position
TRD-GTC9-1 is located on chromosome 14q11.2 within the T-cell receptor delta (TRD) gene cluster.

## Pathology
There is limited information available about the pathology of TRD-GTC9-1. However, alterations in the TRD gene cluster have been associated with various T-cell malignancies, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.

## Function
TRD-GTC9-1 belongs to the TRD gene family, which encodes the delta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR). The TCR is responsible for recognizing antigenic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and initiating an immune response.
