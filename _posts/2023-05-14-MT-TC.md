## Gene MT-TC 

MT-TC is the gene that encodes for mitochondrial tRNA-Cys. It is located on the mitochondrial genome at position 5,947 and spans 69 base pairs. 

### Function 
The mitochondrial tRNA-Cys is involved in the translation of mitochondrial genes into proteins. It specifically carries the amino acid cysteine to the ribosome during protein synthesis. 

### External IDs and Aliases 
- Gene ID: 4578 
- Genomic position: MT:5947-6015

### Related Diseases 
Several mitochondrial diseases, such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, have been associated with mutations on MT-TC. 

### Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment and prognosis for individuals with MT-TC-related mitochondrial diseases vary based on the specific mutation and related symptoms. There are currently no cures for mitochondrial diseases but symptom management and supportive care can help improve quality of life. 

### Drug Response
