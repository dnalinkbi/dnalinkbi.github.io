# Information about gene AXIN1

## Genetic Position
- AXIN1 (Axin 1) is located on chromosome 16 at position 16p13.3.

## Pathology
- Mutations in the AXIN1 gene have been associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer.
- Loss of function mutations in AXIN1 can cause activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in uncontrolled cell division and tumor growth.

## Function
- AXIN1 is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
- AXIN1 forms a complex with other proteins to facilitate the degradation of Î²-catenin (CTNNB1), which is a key downstream effector of the Wnt pathway.

## Related Disease
- Colorectal cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there are no specific treatments for AXIN1 mutations. Treatment options for colorectal cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for colorectal cancer varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and other factors.

## Drug Response
- Studies have shown that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancers with AXIN1 mutations. For example, preclinical studies have shown that the Wnt inhibitor LGK974 can suppress the growth of colorectal cancer cells with AXIN1 mutations.
