## Information about gene SNORD116-1
The SNORD116-1 gene is located on chromosome 15 at position q11.2. This gene produces small nucleolar RNAs that function in the processing of ribosomal RNA. 

- Function for gene: Small nucleolar RNA
- Genomic location: Chromosome 15 at position q11.2
- External IDs: HGNC:10117, NCBI Entrez:346228, Ensembl:ENSG00000199791, OMIM:605319, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:n/a
- Aliases: HBII-85, SNORD116, SNORD116-1
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: No known missense mutations, so no amino acid mutations are listed
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: No known somatic mutations
- Related disease: Prader-Willi syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder caused by the absence of certain genes on chromosome 15, including SNORD116-1. This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and a chronic feeling of hunger that can lead to overeating and obesity.
- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome. There is no cure for the disorder.
- Drug response: N/A
