# Information on Gene ATXN7

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: ATXN7 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 14.3.
- **Pathology**: The ATXN7 gene is associated with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, dysarthria, and retinal degeneration.
- **Function**: The ATXN7 gene encodes for the protein ataxin-7, which is a component of the STAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5-acetyltransferase) transcriptional co-activator complex. The protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription regulation.

## Gene Information

- **External IDs**: ATXN7 is also known as OPCA3, and its genomic location is 3q14.3.
- **Aliases**: None known

## External Sites

- **HGNC**: ATXN7 is listed in HGNC under ID 890.
- **NCBI Entrez**: The gene can be accessed on NCBI Entrez under ID 6315.
- **Ensembl**: The gene is located on the Ensembl genome browser under ENSG00000134107.
- **OMIM**: OMIM maintains a record for ATXN7 (ID: 607640).
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: Ataxin-7 information can be found on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot under ID O15265.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- There are several known mutations in the ATXN7 gene that are associated with SCA7.
- One of the most common mutations is a triplet repeat expansion of the CAG nucleotide sequence in exon 3 of the gene. Normal individuals have a repeat size between 4 to 35, while individuals with SCA7 have a repeat size of more than 37. This expansion leads to the formation of an expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-7 protein, which is believed to be toxic to cells.
- Known mutation types include missense, frameshift, and in-frame indels.
- dbSNP ID: rs72649935, rs118237582, rs199722733, rs121908683 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are no known somatic mutations in the ATXN7 gene.

## Related Diseases

- ATXN7 gene mutations are associated with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects coordination and balance. It is caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the gene, as explained above.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- At present, there is no known cure for SCA7. Treatment of the disease is based on symptomatic management and supportive care.
- The prognosis of SCA7 varies on a case-to-case basis. Generally, the disease is progressive and can lead to severe disability or death. Age at onset and length of the repeat expansion are considered important factors that influence disease progression.

## Drug Response

- At present, there are no specific drugs available to treat SCA7. However, some drugs such as riluzole and lithium have shown some efficacy in treating the symptoms of the disease.
