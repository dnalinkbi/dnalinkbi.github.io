# TP53BP1 gene

## Genetic Position

The TP53BP1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position q15.5.

## Pathology

The TP53BP1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the DNA damage response pathway. Mutations in this gene have been associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer.

## Function

The protein encoded by the TP53BP1 gene is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. It is also involved in regulating the cell cycle and preventing the accumulation of damaged DNA.
