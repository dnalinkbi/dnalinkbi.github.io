# Information about gene PHGDH

## Genetic Position
- The PHGDH gene is located on chromosome 1.
- The genomic coordinates are: 1p12-p11.2

## Pathology
- Mutations in the PHGDH gene have been associated with serine deficiency disorders, such as Neu-Laxova syndrome and D-glyceric aciduria.

## Function
- The PHGDH gene encodes for 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of serine.
- This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphohydroxypyruvate in the presence of NADH.
