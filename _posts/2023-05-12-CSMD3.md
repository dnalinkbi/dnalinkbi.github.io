# Information about gene CSMD3
## Genetic Position
The gene CSMD3 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3) is located on chromosome 8 at the position 8p23.2. It spans approximately 4,728,618 base pairs.

## Pathology
Mutations in CSMD3 have been associated with various diseases including susceptibility to schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and increased risk of prostate cancer.

## Function
The function of CSMD3 is not yet fully understood. It has been suggested to play a role in neurodevelopment and neuronal migration. Additionally, CSMD3 may also play a role in immune system regulation.

## Treatment and Prognosis
As of now, there is no cure for the diseases associated with CSMD3 mutations. However, treatment options are available to manage the symptoms of these diseases.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that patients with CSMD3 mutations respond differently to certain antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia.
