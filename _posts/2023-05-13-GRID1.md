## Function
GRID1 gene encodes an ionotropic glutamate receptor that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and cognition. The encoded protein belongs to the delta subfamily of glutamate receptors and is mainly expressed in the cerebellum, involved in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Studies have suggested that the GRID1 gene is involved in autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

## Mutations and Pathology
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Several new and rare missense variants in the GRID1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of autism. For example, the missense variant p.Ser390Cys has been reported to be associated with autism spectrum disorder (dbSNP ID: rs140446880). Similarly, missense variant p.Thr917Ala has also been found to be associated with autism (dbSNP ID: rs138316157).
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** GRID1 mutations have not been commonly observed in any tumor types or other conditions.
- **Related Disease:** GRID1 gene mutations and variations have been associated with various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for GRID1 gene mutations and associated disorders depend on the specific condition being addressed. There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, but behavioral therapy, medication, and other interventions can help improve the quality of life. Similarly, treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has improved in recent years with the use of antipsychotic medication and supportive therapy. 
- **Drug Response:** There are currently no drugs specifically targeting GRID1 mutations, but certain medications such as antipsychotics have been shown to be helpful in treating associated disorders.
