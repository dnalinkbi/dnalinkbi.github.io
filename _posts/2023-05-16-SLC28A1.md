# Gene Information for SLC28A1

## Genetic Position
SLC28A1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 15. It is found at 15q13.1.

## Pathology
SLC28A1 is associated with a disease known as H syndrome. This is characterized by hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth), and other systemic features. The H syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene SLC29A3. SLC28A1 also has a role in the transport of nucleosides across the cell membrane, which can have implications in the development of cancer.

## Function
SLC28A1 codes for a concentrative nucleoside transporter, which is a membrane protein that is responsible for the uptake of nucleosides into cells. 

## External IDs
- Genomic location: 15q13.1

## AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg184Ser (rs111617834)
- p.Ser849Leu (rs111543572)
- p.Arg23Ter (rs143683417)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic variants of SLC28A1 that have been identified through various cancer genomics studies, including:
- c.665T>C (rs17850031)
- c.1114A>C (rs17850032)
- c.649A>T (rs17850030)

## Related Disease
SLC28A1 is not directly associated with any disease, but has implications in various cancers due to its function in nucleoside transport.

## Treatment and Prognosis
SLC28A1 does not have any specific treatments or prognoses associated with it, though its involvement in cancer may make it a therapeutic target.

## Drug Response
SLC28A1 is involved in the transport of various nucleoside drugs, including gemcitabine used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, and fludarabine used in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.
