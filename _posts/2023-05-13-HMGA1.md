# Gene: HMGA1

## Genetic Position:
HMGA1 is located on chromosome 6p21.31.

## Pathology:
HMGA1 is associated with different cancers, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, etc. Its overexpression has been linked to tumor progression and malignant transformation.

## Function:
HMGA1 belongs to the high mobility group A (HMGA) protein family which is involved in regulating gene expression. Specifically, HMGA1 binds to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA sequences and alters DNA conformation, which can ultimately modify transcriptional activity.

- c.145A>C (p.Ile49Leu) - rs398123319

## Related disease:
HMGA1 has been linked to different types of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, etc.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
The overexpression of HMGA1 in tumors usually correlates with a poor prognosis and reduced survival. Targeting HMGA1 could represent a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

## Drug response:
There is currently no approved drug therapy targeting HMGA1.
