## Gene: NDUFAF7

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 16:26,051,315-26,056,051

**Function:** The NDUFAF7 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It plays a role in the biogenesis and assembly of complex I, and is essential for its proper function.

**External IDs and Aliases:**

- HGNC: 17093
- NCBI Entrez: 50415
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109674
- OMIM: 612392
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96JG6

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several reported variations in the NDUFAF7 gene. Some of the mutations reported are:

- p.Leu139Pro (rs139239678): missense mutation
- p.Val192Gly (rs140982820): missense mutation
- p.Gln177His (rs202124141): missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related Diseases:** Mutations in NDUFAF7 have been linked to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can lead to a range of symptoms such as seizures, developmental delay, and muscle weakness.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency, and treatment is largely supportive. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the specific symptoms exhibited.

**Drug response:** Studies have suggested that targeting complex I deficiencies could be a potential therapeutic strategy. However, there are currently no drugs specifically targeting NDUFAF7.
