# Gene: STS

## Information about Gene:
**Function:** Steroid sulfatase (STS) is responsible for the hydrolysis of estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, converting them into estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone, respectively. These compounds are important in the regulation of reproductive hormone levels in both males and females.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location:** 
- Gene ID: 6792

- c.412T>G (p.Leu138Arg) - rs771543097
- c.661_662insC (p.Leu221fs) - rs886042890

**Related Diseases:** X-linked ichthyosis, Conradi-Hunermann syndrome, ichthyosis, spastic diplegia 

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for STS-related disorders is primarily symptomatic and supportive, and may include topical creams or oral medications to reduce symptoms of skin problems. The prognosis is variable and dependent on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

**Drug Response:** There is limited information available on drug response for STS-related disorders. However, studies have suggested that topical application of gels or creams containing STS inhibitors may be useful in managing skin symptoms.
