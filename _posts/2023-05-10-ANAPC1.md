## Information about gene ANAPC1

### Genetic Position
The ANAPC1 gene is located on the **chromosome 2** at the position **2q33.1.**

### Pathology and Function
The ANAPC1 gene encodes a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It is involved in the degradation of cyclin B, securin, and other substrates, which are essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Mutations or dysregulation of ANAPC1 have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast and lung cancer.
