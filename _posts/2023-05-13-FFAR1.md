# Information about Gene FFAR1

### Genetic Position
- FFAR1 gene is located in the Chromosome 19: 12,074,332 -12,078,576 bp.

### Pathology
- FFAR1 is associated with type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity.

### Function
- FFAR1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that binds with free fatty acids (FFAs) and regulates glucose homeostasis and insulin release in the body.

### Related Disease
- Type II diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome
- Obesity

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Targeting FFAR1 receptor with drugs has shown promising results in controlling blood glucose levels in type II diabetes patients.
- Patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome can benefit from lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to prevent the progression of these conditions.

### Drug Response
- TAK-875, a selective FFAR1 agonist, has been shown to improve insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in clinical trials.
