## Gene BCAN

- **Function:** The BCAN gene encodes for a protein called brevican, which is a member of the lectican family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Brevican is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and in certain tumors, where it has been implicated in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation.
