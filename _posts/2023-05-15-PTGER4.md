## Gene PTGER4

### Information
**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 5, NC_000005.10 (156,946,759...157,236,947)
    
**Pathology:** PTGER4 gene is associated with asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.
    
**Function:** The PTGER4 gene encodes a receptor for prostaglandin E2, which is involved in various physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation, fever, and pain. 
    
**Aliases:** EP4, Prostanoid EP4 receptor, PGE2 receptor EP4 subtype, PGE2-R EP4 subtype

**Related Disease:** Asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.
    
**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no known cure for asthma. Treatment options for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic agents such as TNF inhibitors. The prognosis for these diseases may vary depending on the severity and response to treatment.

**Drug Response:** PTGER4 antagonists are under investigation for their potential therapeutic uses. Some drugs, such as ONO-AE3-208, AH 23848, and AH 23859, have been shown to have antagonistic effects on PTGER4.
