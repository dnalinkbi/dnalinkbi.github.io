# Information on Gene SLC2A1


## Genetic Position

Gene SLC2A1 is located on chromosome 1 at the location 1p34.2.


## Pathology

Mutations in SLC2A1 have been linked to a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder called GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. The disease causes impaired glucose transport to the brain leading to developmental delay, movement disorders, and seizures.


## Function of Gene

SLC2A1 encodes glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1), which is expressed in a variety of tissues including the blood-brain barrier. GLUT1 protein is involved in the transportation of glucose from the bloodstream into the cells of the body.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in SLC2A1 have been associated with the following diseases:
- GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome
- Epilepsy
- Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency


## Treatment and Prognosis

SLC2A1 deficiency can be treated with a ketogenic diet consisting of high-fat, low-carbohydrate foods, which can improve the symptoms of seizures and movement disorders in patients. With proper treatment, the prognosis for individuals with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is generally good.


## Drug Response

The response of patients with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome to antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital and valproate is usually poor. However, the ketogenic diet has been shown to significantly improve seizure control and movement disorders in these patients.
