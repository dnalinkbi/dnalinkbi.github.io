# Information about Gene FOXG1

## Genetic Position

The gene FOXG1 is located on chromosome 14q12 and spans a region of 35 kilobases.

## Pathology

Mutations in the FOXG1 gene have been associated with a variety of neurological disorders, including Rett syndrome, congenital variant of Rett syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, and developmental delay. These disorders are often characterized by impaired cognitive and motor function.

## Function

The FOXG1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays an important role in embryonic brain development. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, and is also important for maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs and InDels reported for FOXG1 gene in various cancers, including ovarian, lung, and breast cancer. Some of these variants are:

- rs76041604
- rs201301934
- rs201425301

## Related Diseases

Mutations in FOXG1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, including:

- Rett Syndrome
- Congenital variant of Rett syndrome
- Epileptic encephalopathy
- Developmental delay

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for disorders caused by mutations in FOXG1 gene are limited, as the underlying mechanisms of these disorders are not fully understood. Supportive care and early intervention can improve outcomes for affected individuals.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response for diseases caused by mutations in FOXG1 gene.
