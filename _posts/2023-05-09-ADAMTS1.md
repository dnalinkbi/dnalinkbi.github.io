## Gene: ADAMTS1

### Position: 
The ADAMTS1 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1) gene is located on chromosome 21q21.3.

### Pathology: 
ADAMTS1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of extracellular matrix organization, inhibition of angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. Studies suggest that ADAMTS1 could act as a tumor suppressor gene in certain types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer.

### Function:
ADAMTS1 is a member of the ADAMTS protein family that cleaves extracellular matrix proteoglycans. It is involved in various processes, including the regulation of angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.
