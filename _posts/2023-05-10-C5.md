# Gene Information for C5

## Gene Function
C5 (Complement C5) is a protein-coding gene that is a part of the complement system, which is an important component of the immune system. The C5 protein is crucial for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is responsible for the lysis of certain types of bacteria, as well as other foreign cells.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the C5 gene have been associated with various forms of complement-mediated diseases, including:
- Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD)
- Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS)
- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
- Complement component 5 deficiency

## Treatment and Prognosis 
There is no known cure for C5-related diseases, but treatment options can include the use of immunosuppressive therapies, plasma exchange, or complement inhibitors such as eculizumab. The prognosis of C5-related diseases varies depending on the specific condition and its severity, but some forms can lead to chronic kidney failure or vision loss if left untreated.

## Drug Response
Eculizumab is a drug that targets the C5 protein and has been approved for the treatment of aHUS and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It has shown promising results in clinical trials for other complement-mediated diseases as well.
