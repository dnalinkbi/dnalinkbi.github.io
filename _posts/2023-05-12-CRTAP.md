# Gene CRTAP

## Information
- **Pathology**: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a genetic bone disorder.
- **Function**: This gene encodes a protein that is involved in post-translational modification of collagen. It is an essential component of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, which hydroxylates proline residues in type I collagen. This modification is necessary for the proper stability of collagen triple helix. 
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 10491
    - Genomic Position: Chr3:32,708,965-32,730,300
    - Aliases: C-GP, CATP, CRT, OI13
- **External Sites**: 
    - HGNC: 2375
    - NCBI Entrez: 10491
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000169249
    - OMIM: 605497
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60884

## Related Diseases
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type 7 (OI7)
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type 13 (OI13) 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for OI, and treatment options mostly focus on managing symptoms such as fractures and improving bone density. Prognosis for OI can vary depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
According to some studies, bisphosphonates and teriparatide are potential drug treatments for OI. However, some OI patients have reported adverse effects with the use of bisphosphonates. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any medications.
