## Information about Gene IL1RN

The gene IL1RN encodes the protein interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), which is involved in the regulation of the immune response. It is located on chromosome 2q14.2.

### Function

IL-1RA is a natural inhibitor of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). It binds to the IL-1 receptors, thereby blocking the activity of IL-1 and preventing the inflammatory response.

Aliases: IRAP, IL1F3, IL1RA, IL1RN1.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations reported in the IL1RN gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. The most common mutation is the c.101T>C (p.Leu34Pro) missense mutation, which has been associated with an increased risk of chronic periodontitis.

dbSNP ID: rs315952, rs1143627, rs17059142.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are somatic mutations reported in the IL1RN gene, including SNVs and InDels. However, their clinical significance is unclear.

dbSNP ID: rs3747742, rs2232368.

### Related disease

IL-1RA deficiency has been associated with an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, such as meningococcal infections and tuberculosis. IL-1RA has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis.

### Treatment and prognosis

IL-1RA has been used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. The prognosis of IL-1RA deficiency depends on the severity of the infections and the promptness of diagnosis and treatment.

### Drug response

IL-1 inhibitors, such as anakinra, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of several inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.
