# Gene: SAMHD1

## Genetic Position:
SAMHD1 is located on chromosome 20q11-13.2 in humans.

## Pathology:
Mutations in SAMHD1 have been associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the brain and the immune system.

## Function:
SAMHD1 regulates the intracellular concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), which are required for DNA synthesis. It is involved in maintaining genomic stability and preventing the accumulation of aberrant nucleic acid species.

- c.1816C>T (rs797044146)
- c.2086G>A (rs201834517)

## Related Disease:
- Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, there is no cure for AGS. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, with the goal of reducing inflammation and improving quality of life.

## Drug Response:
The role of SAMHD1 in drug response is currently unclear.
