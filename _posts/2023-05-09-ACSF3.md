## Gene Information: ACSF3

### Genetic Position

ACSF3 is located on chromosome 16 at 16p12.2.

### Pathology

Mutations in ACSF3 have been associated with novel intellectual disability syndrome and epilepsy.

### Function

ACSF3 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acids to acyl-CoA, a crucial step in beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation is the process by which cells break down fatty acids to generate ATP, the primary source of energy for the cell.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is limited information available about somatic mutations in ACSF3.

### Related Disease

Mutations in ACSF3 have been associated with intellectual disability syndrome and epilepsy. However, more studies are needed to determine the full range of clinical manifestations associated with mutations in this gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for the genetic conditions associated with mutations in ACSF3. Treatment options are generally supportive and aim to manage symptoms. The long-term prognosis for affected individuals may vary widely depending on the specific mutation and clinical manifestations.

### Drug response

There is currently no information available regarding drug response in individuals with mutations in ACSF3.
