# Gene ACAT1

## Genomic Information
- **External IDs**: HGNC: 94, NCBI Entrez: 38, Ensembl: ENSG00000132964, OMIM: 607809, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P24752
- **Aliases**: ACHMS, THIL, ACAT1-001, ACAT1-002, ACAT1-003, ACAT1-201, ACAT1-202, ACAT1-203
- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 11q22.3

## Function
The ACAT1 gene encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, which is involved in the breakdown and utilization of fats for energy production. It catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA from two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which is a key step in the process of ketogenesis.

## Variations and Related Diseases
- **AA mutation list**: Several non-synonymous mutations have been reported for ACAT1, including p.Ser208Thr, p.Ala212Thr, and p.Pro424Leu. Each of these mutations have been associated with beta-ketothiolase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired ketone body utilization, resulting in episodes of metabolic acidosis and ketoacidosis.
- **Mutation type**: Missense mutations
- **dbSNP ID**: rs104894802, rs104894803, rs104894804
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported

## Related Diseases
Beta-ketothiolase deficiency, also known as mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiency, is the only known disease associated with mutations in ACAT1. The condition is rare, with fewer than 100 cases reported in the medical literature. Symptoms can include recurrent episodes of vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, and metabolic acidosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for beta-ketothiolase deficiency, and treatment is largely supportive. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required to manage metabolic imbalances and prevent life-threatening complications. Long-term management typically involves a ketogenic diet, which is high in fats and low in carbohydrates.
 
## Drug Response
No specific drugs have been approved for the treatment of beta-ketothiolase deficiency, and drug response data is not available.
