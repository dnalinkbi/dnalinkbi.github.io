# Information on Gene WAS

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** The gene WAS is located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.23-p11.22.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the WAS gene are associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.

- **Function:** The protein encoded by the WAS gene, WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein), is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and regulation of immune cell functions such as T-cell activation, phagocytosis, and cytokine production.

## Gene Information

- **Function for Gene:** WAS encodes the WASP protein which plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics and immune cell function.

    - OMIM: 301000
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P42768

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** Mutations in the WAS gene are associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. There are numerous mutations reported in the literature, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. 

  Example: A known pathogenic variant is c.886C>T (p.Pro296Leu) with dbSNP ID rs121908479.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are currently no known somatic mutations in the WAS gene.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the WAS gene are linked to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms but often includes immunoglobulin replacement therapy, antibiotics, and stem cell transplantation. The prognosis for individuals with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is variable, with some individuals experiencing severe disease and others having a milder phenotype.

- **Drug Response:** There is no specific drug available for treating Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, but treatments targeted at individual symptoms such as eczema or infections may be helpful.
