# Information about Gene TNXB:

The TNXB gene is located on Chromosome 6 (6p21.33) and encodes the Tenascin-XB protein. It is associated with a range of pathological conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). 

## Function:
The Tenascin-XB protein is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is involved in tissue development, wound healing, and cell adhesion. It is known to play a critical role in maintaining the structure and integrity of connective tissues.

## External IDs and Aliases:
- Gene ID: 7148
- HGNC: 11811
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000112118
- OMIM ID: 600985
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9H239
- Aliases: None

## Variation (Mutations):
- AA Mutation List: Several mutations have been identified in the TNXB gene which cause changes in the protein sequence. Some examples of these mutations include p.Arg580His, p.Gln2723*, p.Gly2671Arg, and p.Thr48Met. 
- Mutation Type: Missense, Nonsense, and Frameshift
- dbSNP ID: rs387906643, rs387906642, rs387906641, rs387906640, and many more.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- dbSNP ID: None reported so far.

## Related Diseases:
Mutations in the TNXB gene are associated with some pathological conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS).

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for EDS, but treatment options are available to manage symptoms such as pain and joint instability. Physical therapy, medications such as pain relievers, and surgery are some of the common treatment options. Prognosis varies on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response:
No specific drugs have been developed for TNXB gene-related disorders.
