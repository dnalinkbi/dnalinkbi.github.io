## Gene Information Analysis: PPP2R1B

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** PPP2R1B is a gene located on chromosome 11, at the position 11q23.2.

- **Pathology:** PPP2R1B has been linked to several types of cancer, including breast cancer, glioma, and ovarian cancer. The gene is frequently deleted in these cancer types and its loss is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.

- **Function:** PPP2R1B encodes a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. PP2A is a protein phosphatase that regulates various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. PPP2R1B is specifically involved in the regulation of the mitotic checkpoint, a process that ensures the correct distribution of chromosomes during cell division.

### Related Disease

PPP2R1B has been associated with various types of cancer including breast cancer, glioma, and pancreatic cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

As PPP2R1B is a potential tumor suppressor gene, its loss is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. There is no targeted therapy available yet, however, its expression pattern and the probability of survival can be used as prognostic predictors for a particular type of cancer. 

### Drug Response

There are no known drugs targeting PPP2R1B directly, however, the overall PP2A enzyme activity can be modulated by small molecules such as FTY720.
