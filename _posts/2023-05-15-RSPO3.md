## Gene: RSPO3

### Information about gene
- **Pathology:** R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) is a member of a family of proteins that act as activators of the Wnt signaling pathway. Dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway has been associated with various diseases including cancer, developmental disorders, and degenerative diseases.
- **Function:** The RSPO3 protein plays a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. It acts as a ligand for leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) to enhance the Wnt signaling pathway and activate downstream targets. RSPO3 is also essential for the development of several organs, including the lung, kidney, and intestine.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 84877
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 6q22.33
    - Aliases: R-spondin 3, CRISTIN3

### Genomic variations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the RSPO3 gene, but there are no known disease-causing mutations that have been reported. Some of the SNPs with their dbSNP ID are:
    - rs9507737 - c.601G>A, p.Glu201= (synonymous)
    - rs598489 - c.760G>A, p.Ala254Thr (missense)
    - rs13188527 - c.156+59C>T (intron)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no known somatic mutations reported in the RSPO3 gene.

### Related diseases
- RSPO3 has been associated with various types of cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer. Studies have shown that RSPO3 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells by enhancing the Wnt signaling pathway.

### Treatment and prognosis
- As RSPO3 is involved in the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, it is a potential target for cancer therapy. Several studies have shown that inhibiting RSPO3 can reduce tumor growth and improve the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer patients. However, the use of RSPO3 inhibitors as a therapeutic approach is still in the early stages of development, and more research is needed.

### Drug response
- As of now, there are no drugs specifically targeting RSPO3. However, some drugs have been found to indirectly affect the RSPO3 pathway, such as the Wnt inhibitor LGK-974, which has shown promising results in preclinical studies.
