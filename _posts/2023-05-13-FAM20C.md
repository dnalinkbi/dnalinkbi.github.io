## Gene: FAM20C

|   |          |
| - | -------- |
| **Function** | FAM20C encodes for a protein that is involved in the phosphorylation of secreted proteins, specifically regulating the post-translational modification of extracellular matrix proteins. |
| **External IDs** | Gene ID: 56975; Genomic location: Chr7: 135.31 - 135.38 Mb; Aliases: G3X, MGC117331, UNQ756/PRO1456. |
| **External Sites** | HGNC: 19640; NCBI Entrez: 56975; Ensembl: ENSG00000196477; OMIM: 611061; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IWU2. |
| **AA Mutation List** | c.992G>A (p.Gly331Asp) - rs587784075; c.1334T>C (p.Leu445Pro) - rs372982642; c.848G>A (p.Gly283Asp) - rs142585728. |
| **Mutation Type** | Missense variants. |
| **Somatic SNVs/InDels** | None reported. |
| **Related Disease** | Raine syndrome (OMIM: 259775). |
| **Treatment and Prognosis** | Management is primarily supportive, with various interventions depending on the affected individual's symptoms. The prognosis is generally poor, with most affected individuals dying in early infancy or childhood. |
