# Information on gene LCT

## Overview
The LCT gene encodes for lactase enzyme that is responsible for hydrolyzing lactose into glucose and galactose. Lactose is a sugar present in milk and other dairy products which cannot be easily digested by some individuals. The LCT gene is located on chromosome 2 at position 2q21. 

## Function
The LCT gene encodes for lactase enzyme, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose. It plays a vital role in the digestion of lactose and the absorption of nutrients.

## Related disease
Primary lactose intolerance is a disorder caused by a reduction in the activity of lactase enzyme due to genetic mutations in the LCT gene. Individuals with this disease experience gastrointestinal discomfort after consuming dairy products.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for lactose intolerance, but symptoms can be managed through a lactose-free diet. Prognosis is good for individuals with lactose intolerance as long as they manage their diet well.

## Drug response
Individuals with lactose intolerance can use lactase enzyme supplements to help them digest lactose. The effectiveness of these supplements can vary among individuals.
