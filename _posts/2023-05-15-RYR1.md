## Information about Gene RYR1

### Genetic Position:
The RYR1 gene is located on human chromosome 19q13.1.

### Pathology:
Mutations in the RYR1 gene are known to cause malignant hyperthermia (MH), which is a rare but potentially fatal condition triggered by exposure to certain anesthesia drugs. Mutations in RYR1 can also cause Central Core Disease (CCD), which is a rare muscle disorder that presents at birth or early childhood.

### Function:
The RYR1 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor, which plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by releasing stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 10475
- NCBI Entrez: 6261
- Ensembl: ENSG00000196218
- OMIM: 180901
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P21817

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg163Cys (rs121912852)
- p.Arg2163Cys (rs1057518771)
- p.Arg2502His (rs61732393)
- p.Arg2163His (rs104894485)
- p.Gly2375Arg (rs143445213)
- p.Arg2452Cys (rs797044934)
- p.Arg614Cys (rs63751349)
- p.Arg2163Ser (rs1057518772)
- p.Ala2488Thr (rs137854189)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no known somatic mutations in the RYR1 gene.

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the RYR1 gene are associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH) and Central Core Disease (CCD).

### Treatment and prognosis:
Individuals with malignant hyperthermia (MH) should avoid triggering agents such as certain anesthetics and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms such as rapid heart rate, high fever, and muscle rigidity occur. Treatment typically includes administration of dantrolene and supportive care. Central Core Disease (CCD) does not have a cure, but physical therapy and other supportive measures can help manage symptoms.

### Drug response:
Individuals with known mutations in the RYR1 gene should inform their healthcare providers prior to undergoing any anesthesia. Dantrolene is an effective treatment for MH.
