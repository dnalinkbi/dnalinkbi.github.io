## Gene: IL6R

**Function:** The IL6R gene encodes for the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) protein. This protein forms a complex with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and is involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation.

**Genomic Location (GRCh38):** Chromosome 1, NC_000001.11 (123,157,289-123,217,089)

**Aliases:** CD126, gp80, IL6Q

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 5983
- NCBI Entrez: 3570
- Ensembl: ENSG00000160712
- OMIM: 147880
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08887

**AA Mutation List:** 
- c.1818A>G (p.Asn606Ser) rs2228145
- c.1744A>C (p.Asn582Thr) rs2228146
- c.1741G>T (p.Asp581Tyr) rs2228144

**Mutation Type:** Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** None reported in COSMIC database (as of September 2021)

**Related Disease:** IL6R gene mutations/polymorphisms have been associated with various diseases such as:

- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Asthma
- Multiple sclerosis
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Prostate cancer
- Hodgkin's lymphoma

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is limited information on the treatment and prognosis of IL6R-related diseases. However, targeting IL-6R with monoclonal antibodies (e.g. tocilizumab) has shown promise in treating certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.

**Drug Response:** Individuals with certain IL6R gene polymorphisms have shown varying responses to treatment with IL-6R inhibitors such as tocilizumab.
