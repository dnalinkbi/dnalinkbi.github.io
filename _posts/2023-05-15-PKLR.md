# Information about gene PKLR

## Genetic Position
The PKLR gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.13.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PKLR gene are known to cause pyruvate kinase deficiency, which is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects red blood cells. This condition can cause hemolytic anemia, which is the breakdown of red blood cells and can lead to jaundice, fatigue, and other symptoms.

## Function
The PKLR gene encodes for pyruvate kinase, which is an enzyme involved in glycolysis. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

## Mutation Type and dbSNP ID
All of the above mutations are missense mutations, except for R479H which is a nonsense mutation. Each mutation's corresponding dbSNP ID is indicated in the AA Mutation List.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the PKLR gene listed in dbSNP, including SNVs and indels. However, since pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder and affects red blood cells, somatic mutations in the gene are not relevant to the pathology of the disease.

## Related Disease
The PKLR gene is associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency, which is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects red blood cells.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for pyruvate kinase deficiency may include blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, and a bone marrow transplant. The prognosis for the condition varies depending on the severity of the disease and the individual case.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency, but some medications used to treat other types of anemia may be beneficial in managing symptoms.
