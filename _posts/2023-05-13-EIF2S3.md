## Gene EIF2S3

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: X
- Location: Xq28

### Pathology
EIF2S3 gene is associated with intellectual disability, X-linked, syndromic, Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome, , and Turner syndrome.

### Function
EIF2S3 encodes for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit gamma (eIF2Î³). This protein enables the start of the process of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000102014
- OMIM ID: 300189
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P41091
- Aliases: EIF2-gamma, eIF-2 gamma, EIF2S3B, IF2S3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Pro740Leu (missense) with dbSNP ID: rs761263265
- p.Leu687Ile (missense) with dbSNP ID: rs1554287662

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

### Related Disease
EIF2S3 gene is associated with Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome, which is a developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, delayed speech, and facial dysmorphism. This syndrome is caused by a mutation in the EIF2S3 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome. The treatment is symptomatic and supportive, aimed at improving the quality of life of affected individuals.

### Drug Response
No information is available on drug response related to EIF2S3 gene.
