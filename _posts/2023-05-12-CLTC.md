# Information about gene CLTC

## Genomic Position
The gene CLTC is located on the Chromosome 17 at position p11.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CLTC gene are associated with several diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, and Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.

## Function
The CLTC gene encodes for clathrin heavy chain, which plays a crucial role in the formation and function of clathrin-coated vesicles that are responsible for intracellular vesicular transport of various substances.

## External IDs and Aliases
The external IDs for the CLTC gene are:
- HGNC: 2025
- NCBI Entrez: 1211
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109063
- OMIM: 118955
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q00610

The aliases for the CLTC gene are:
- CHC
- CLH-17
- CLTH
- clathrin heavy chain

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Leu1033Ser (rs267607155) - missense mutation
- p.Glu1598Lys (rs1135840) - missense mutation

- c.2165C>A (rs868780757) - missense mutation in colon adenocarcinoma

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CLTC gene are associated with several diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, and Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for CLTC-related diseases. Treatment is mainly focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the disease and its severity.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response for CLTC-related diseases due to the complexity of the disease and the lack of targeted therapies.
