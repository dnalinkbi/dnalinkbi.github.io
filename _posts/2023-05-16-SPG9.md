## Information about gene SPG9

**Genetic Position:** SPG9 is located on chromosome 10 at the position 10q23.31.

**Pathology:** SPG9 is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which is a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs.

**Function:** The SPG9 gene encodes a protein called spastizin, which is involved in the development and maintenance of neurons.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 11247
- NCBI Entrez: 440515
- Ensembl: ENSG00000107740
- OMIM: 601162
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6PJP6

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

| Mutation Type | AA Mutation | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missense | p.Lys452Asn | rs750083740 |
| Missense | p.Arg178His | rs750778086 |
| Missense | p.Ser162Leu | rs780247921 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no known somatic mutations in SPG9.

**Related Disease:** Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for HSP and treatment is symptomatic. Generally, the prognosis for individuals with HSP varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

**Drug Response:** There is no known drug specifically designed to treat HSP.

**Instructions:**

Please provide specific information about the gene SPG9, such as its genetic position, pathology, function, external IDs with aliases, AA mutations with their dbSNP ID, somatic SNVs and InDels with dbSNP ID, related disease, treatment and prognosis, and drug response. Additionally, provide the subject, author name, and DOI links to relevant papers if available. Please use markdown format for your response.
