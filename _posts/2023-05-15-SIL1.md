# Gene SIL1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 5
- Location: 5q31.2

## Pathology
Mutations in the SIL1 gene can cause Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.

## Function for Gene
The SIL1 gene encodes for a protein called SIL1, which is involved in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the SIL1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SIL1 gene cause Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome, which is a rare disease characterized by muscle weakness, ataxia, cataracts, and intellectual disability.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on managing the individual symptoms of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specific to mutations in the SIL1 gene.
