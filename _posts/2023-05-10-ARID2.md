# Information about gene ARID2

## Genetic position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic position:** ARID2 gene is located on chromosome 12q12 and spans about 171 kilobases of genomic DNA.
- **Pathology:** ARID2 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation has been implicated in the development of several cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
- **Function:** ARID2 encodes a member of the AT-rich interactive domain (ARID) family of DNA-binding proteins, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression. ARID2 is a component of the PBAF (polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor) complex, which regulates the chromatin structure and transcription of target genes.

## Other information

- **External IDs:** ARID2 gene is also known as BAF200, BRG1-associated factor 200, and SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 2. The genomic location of ARID2 is NC_000012.12.
