# Information about gene REEP1

**Genetic Position:** REEP1 gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.23).

**Function:** REEP1 encodes for receptor expression enhancing protein 1, which is an integral membrane protein involved in shaping and maintaining the structure and function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It participates in organelle membrane dynamics, vesicular transport, and lipid metabolism within the ER. 

**External IDs, aliases, and genomic location:** 
- HGNC ID: HGNC:9938
- NCBI Entrez ID: 65055
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000137103
- OMIM ID: 609139
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96J26
- Aliases: SPG31, spastic paraplegia 31

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** 
-  A166T (rs61759690) 
- S23R (rs61755338) 
- T66M (rs61753890) 
- E311K (rs28936679) 
- M1V (rs76776927)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Not available

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the REEP1 gene are associated with spastic paraplegia type 31 (SPG31), a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects the corticospinal tracts causing lower limb spasticity, weakness, and muscle wasting.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for SPG31 is mainly supportive and symptomatic. No cure is available for the disorder; thus, prognosis remains poor. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may help improve overall quality of life.

**Drug Response:** Not available
