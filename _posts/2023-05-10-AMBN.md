# Information about gene AMBN

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4q13.3

**Pathology:** AMBN gene mutations have been associated with non-syndromic amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), which is a genetic disorder affecting the formation of tooth enamel.

**Function:** The AMBN gene encodes for the ameloblastin protein, which is a major component of tooth enamel and plays a crucial role in enamel formation.

**External IDs and Aliases:** 
- HGNC: 469
- NCBI Entrez: 790
- Ensembl: ENSG00000058404
- OMIM: 104530
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P24043

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg180Ter (rs28940871)
- p.Glu61Lys (rs137852889)
- p.Gly178Arg (rs200302174)
- p.Cys120Ser (rs5742778)
- p.Ala178Thr (rs74598029)
- p.Val196Asp (rs121917864)
- p.Leu41Pro (rs796051201)
- p.Ala38Pro (rs796051200)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Related Disease:** Non-syndromic amelogenesis imperfecta

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for AI, but treatments can be administered to improve the appearance and function of teeth. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the course of treatment.

**Drug Response:** There is no specific drug therapy for AI, but fluoride treatment and restoration of enamel defects are common therapeutic approaches.
