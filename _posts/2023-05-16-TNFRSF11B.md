# Information about Gene TNFRSF11B

## Genetic Position and Pathology

* The gene TNFRSF11B is located on chromosome 8, specifically on the long arm at position 11.2 (8q11.2).
* This gene is associated with bone metabolism and regulates the activity of osteoclasts by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and function. 
* Mutations in TNFRSF11B have been identified in individuals with Paget's disease of bone, a chronic disorder that results in enlarged and weakened bones.

## Function of Gene 

* The primary function of TNFRSF11B is to regulate osteoclastogenesis by binding to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL). 
* TNFRSF11B competes with RANKL for binding to its receptor, RANK, which in turn inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activity. 

## External IDs and Aliases

* HGNC: 11876
* NCBI Entrez: 4982
* Ensembl: ENSG00000120738
* OMIM: 602642
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00300
* Aliases: OPG, OCIF, PDB7

## Related Disease

* Paget's disease of bone is the primary disease associated with mutations in TNFRSF11B. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

* Bisphosphonates are commonly used to treat Paget's disease of bone by inhibiting osteoclast activity. 
* Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disease, but with proper management, most individuals can maintain bone health and function.

## Drug Response

* Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in treating Paget's disease of bone, indicating a positive drug response in inhibiting osteoclast activity.
