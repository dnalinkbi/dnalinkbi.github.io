## Gene UTF1

### Genetic Position
Gene UTF1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q13.2.

### Pathology
Research on gene UTF1 is limited. However, it has been suggested in some studies that there might be a correlation between the expression levels of UTF1 and malignant progression in some forms of cancer.

### Function 
Gene UTF1 encodes undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 which plays a role in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. It also contributes to the regulation of self-renewal, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migration.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- Gene: UTF1, UNF, hUTF1 
- Genomic Location: 11q13.2 
- Aliases: Undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1

### Related Diseases
Research has shown a correlation between levels of UTF1 expression and cancer malignancy progression. Additionally, mutation or dysregulation of UTF1 has been implicated in the following diseases: 
- Glioblastoma 
- Embryonic Carcinoma 
- Germ Cell Cancer 

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID 
Currently, there are no known pathogenic mutations or single nucleotide variants specifically assigned to the UTF1 gene. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the UTF1 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no established treatment or prognosis specifically for UTF1 gene dysregulation. However, targeting UTF1 expression may have therapeutic effects in certain types of cancer, including glioblastoma and germ cell cancers, by promoting differentiation and angiogenesis.

### Drug Response 
No FDA-approved drugs have been specifically designed to target the UTF1 gene.
