## Gene Information for RELN

- **Function:** RELN codes for a protein called Reelin, which is essential for neuronal migration and positioning during embryonic development. It also plays a role in synapse formation and plasticity in the adult brain.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: [5649]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5649))
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 7, q22.1
    - Aliases: RELN1, LRP8
- **External Sites:**
    - HGNC: [HGNC:9958]([Click](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:9958))
    - NCBI Entrez: [5649]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5649))

    - OMIM: [600514]([Click](https://www.omim.org/entry/600514))
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: [P78509]([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P78509))
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - Several missense mutations have been reported in the RELN gene, causing amino acid changes in the Reelin protein.
        - c.7642G>A (p.Arg2548His) - rs104886689
        - c.8294G>A (p.Arg2765Gln) - rs1064792677
        - c.8308A>C (p.Ile2770Leu) - rs764817924
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No somatic mutations have been reported for this gene.
- **Related Disease:** 
    - Mutations in the RELN gene have been linked to lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH), a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal brain development and neurodevelopmental delays.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - As LCH is a rare genetic disorder, there is currently no cure for it. However, patients with LCH can benefit from symptomatic treatment and physical therapy to manage their symptoms.
- **Drug Response:**
    - There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the mutated RELN gene.
