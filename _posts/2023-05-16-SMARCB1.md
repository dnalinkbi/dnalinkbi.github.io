# Information about SMARCB1 gene

**Genetic Position and Pathology**

- SMARCB1, also known as Snf5/Ini1, is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q11.23.

- Pathologically, loss of function mutations (i.e. deletion, frame-shift, missense) in this gene have been associated with a rare form of pediatric cancer called **rhabdoid tumor**.

**Function for gene**

- SMARCB1 is a core member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure.

- SMARCB1 specifically functions as a subunit of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex to facilitate sliding of nucleosomes on the DNA.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**

- Some of the frequently observed SMARCB1 missense mutations with dbSNP ID are:
    - R86H (rs387906942)
    - E129K (rs878853997)

    - K337E (rs267606925)
    - Q357R (rs267606930)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

- Some of the frequently observed SMARCB1 somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID are:
    - c.205C>T (rs750062954)
    - c.222+1G>A (rs756750870)
    - c.429_430delAG (rs770781328)
    - c.579C>T (rs747034946)
    - c.760G>A (rs764834191)

**Related disease**

- Rhabdoid tumor is a rare, highly malignant pediatric tumor that typically occurs in the kidney and brain. Loss of function mutations in SMARCB1 is observed in most (but not all) cases of rhabdoid tumor.
  
**Treatment and prognosis**

- The prognosis for rhabdoid tumor is poor, and it typically has a high rate of recurrence and distant metastasis. Treatment usually involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
- SMARCB1 mutations have also been observed in other cancers such as epithelioid sarcoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, among others. The therapeutic options and prognosis depend on the specific cancer and stage of the disease.

**Drug response**

- There are currently no drugs that directly target SMARCB1. Treatment is mainly based on conventional chemotherapy agents.
