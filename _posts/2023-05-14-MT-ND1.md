# MT-ND1 Gene Information

## Genetic Position 

MT-ND1 gene is located in the mitochondrial genome and specifically in the MT-ND1 region, ranging from nucleotides 3304 to 4261.

## Pathology 

MT-ND1 gene mutations have been associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), Leigh syndrome, and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. LHON is a maternally inherited disorder that causes vision loss by damaging the optic nerve.

## Function 

MT-ND1 gene encodes for NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1, which is a component of complex I in the respiratory chain. The main function of MT-ND1 is to catalyze the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain, leading to the production of ATP.
