# Gene MKL1

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 22: 24115457-24210108

**Pathology**: Mutations in the MKL1 gene have been associated with malignancies such as leukemia and breast cancer.

**Function**: The MKL1 protein is a transcriptional co-activator that plays a role in the regulation of cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization.

**Aliases**: MAL, BSAC, MRTF-A

**External IDs**: 
- HGNC: 7128 
- NCBI Entrez: 57591 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163515 
- OMIM: 606863 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H3S9

**AA Mutation List**: 
- p.Thr165Ala (rs143678378) 
- p.Val392Ile (rs150927637)
- p.Arg431Cys (rs5030868)

**Mutation Type**: Missense

**Somatic SNVs/InDels**: There are several somatic SNVs and InDels in the MKL1 gene listed in the dbSNP database.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in MKL1 have been associated with various types of cancer such as leukemia, breast cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: There is no specific treatment for MKL1 mutations, but researchers are investigating the use of drugs that target the MKL1 pathway as a potential therapeutic approach for cancer. The prognosis for individuals with MKL1 mutations varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.

**Drug Response**: There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of MKL1 mutations, but preclinical studies have shown that in some cancer models, inhibition of the MKL1 pathway can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.
