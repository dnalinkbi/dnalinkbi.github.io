# Information on gene MST1

## Gene Information
- **Gene:** MST1
- **Aliases:** STK4, KRS2, dJ1118D12.2
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 20q13.12
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 11304
    - NCBI Entrez: 6788
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000101439
    - OMIM: 300355
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13043

## Function
- Protein encoded by MST1 gene is a serine/threonine-protein kinase
- Plays an important role in regulating apoptosis, proliferation, and cell signaling pathways
- Involved in Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates organ size and cell proliferation
- Phosphorylated and activated by MST2 and MAPK14/p38-alpha
- Plays a critical role in T-cell homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity

## Mutations
- **AA mutations:**
    - R231H (rs7138788)
    - D120Y (rs2248863)
- **Mutation type:** Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
- **dbSNP ID:** rs7138788 and rs2248863

## Related Diseases
MST1 is associated with the following diseases:
- **Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2A (ALPS2A)**: It is a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal lymphocyte survival leading to chronic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune cytopenias.
- **Cancer**: Dysregulation of MST1 expression and activity has been linked to various cancers including breast, liver, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
- Currently, there is no known specific treatment for MST1-related diseases
- Prognosis depends on the specific disease and severity of symptoms

## Drug Response
- There is limited information on drug responses in relation to MST1 mutations
- One study reported that MST1 inactivation can sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that targeting MST1 could enhance chemotherapeutic response in cancer treatment.
