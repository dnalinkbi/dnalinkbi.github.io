## Gene POLE

- Function: The POLE gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, which is involved in the leading strand synthesis during DNA replication.

- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 9174
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 5426
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000149926
    - OMIM: 174761
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P28340

- AA mutation list:
    - p.Met804Ile (rs61753374)
    - p.Met918Thr (rs773485285)

  Both listed mutations are somatic mutations associated with various cancer types.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels:
   - c.1270C>T (rs61753748)
   - c.2469C>T (rs372967356)

   Both are reported somatic mutations associated with various cancer types.

- Related disease: POLE mutations have been associated with various cancer types, including endometrial, colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancer.
   
- Treatment and prognosis: The presence of POLE mutations can be used as a prognostic marker for better outcomes in cancer patients. The use of DNA-damaging agents, such as platinum-based therapy, has shown promising results in treating POLE-mutant tumors.

- Drug response: POLE mutations have been associated with increased sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab.
