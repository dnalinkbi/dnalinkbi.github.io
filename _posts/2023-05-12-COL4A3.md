# Information about gene COL4A3

## Genetic Position

* Gene: COL4A3
* Chromosome location: Chromosome 2
* Chromosome band: 2q36.3
* Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): 217,976,834-218,177,583

## Pathology and Function 

* Pathology: Mutations in COL4A3 gene are associated with several disorders including Alport syndrome and familial benign hematuria.
* Function: The COL4A3 gene encodes collagen alpha-3(IV) chain, a type of collagen involved in the formation of basement membranes. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues.

## Related Disease

Mutations in COL4A3 gene are associated with several disorders including the following:

- Alport syndrome
- Familial benign hematuria

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for Alport syndrome, however, supportive treatment may help to manage the symptoms. For individuals with familial benign hematuria, the prognosis is generally good, as the condition is usually not associated with significant health problems.

## Drug Response 

There is limited information available on drug response for COL4A3 gene mutations.
