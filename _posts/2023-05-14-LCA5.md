# Gene: LCA5

## Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 6 (6q14.1)
- **Pathology:** LCA5 mutations cause Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a rare genetic disorder that affects the retina and leads to early-onset blindness.
- **Function:** The protein encoded by the LCA5 gene plays a critical role in the biogenesis of photoreceptor cilia and the maintenance of the visual system.

## External IDs

- **HGNC:** 17972
- **NCBI Entrez:** 64127
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000146416
- **OMIM:** 611408
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q8N1F8

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Some LCA5 mutations include: p.T17M (rs150882955), p.R99W (rs587776787), and p.I120T (rs587776788).
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Not applicable.

## Related Diseases

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for LCA5-associated LCA. Treatment is supportive and includes low vision aids and mobility training.
- The prognosis for individuals with LCA5-associated LCA is poor, with most individuals experiencing severe visual impairment from an early age.

## Drug Response

- There is currently no specific drug therapy for LCA5-associated LCA.
