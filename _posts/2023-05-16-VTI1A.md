## Gene VTI1A

### Genetic Position
The VTI1A gene is located on chromosome 10q26.3 and spans 12,178 base pairs.

### Pathology and Function
VTI1A encodes a protein named vesicle transport through interaction with t-SNAREs homolog 1A, which involves in vesicular transport and membrane fusion within the cells. It also plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion.
