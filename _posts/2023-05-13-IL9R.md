# Gene: IL9R

## Information

- **Pathology:** The IL9R gene encodes a receptor for the interleukin 9 (IL-9) cytokine. Activation of this receptor results in the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and downstream signaling events involving PI3K and MAP kinase. IL-9 signaling has been implicated in asthma and other allergic diseases, as well as in the development of certain cancers.
- **Function:** The IL9R protein is a receptor for the IL-9 cytokine, which is involved in a variety of biological responses including cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 5971
    - NCBI Entrez: 3581
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000186288
    - OMIM: 300308
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01113
- **Aliases:** 
    - CD129 antigen
    - interleukin-9 receptor subunit beta

## Associated Diseases

Mutations in the IL9R gene have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Asthma
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with mutations in the IL9R gene will depend on the specific disease and mutation.

## Drug Response

There are currently no drugs specifically targeting the IL9R protein, but IL-9 blocking therapies are being investigated for their potential use in treating asthma and other allergic diseases.
