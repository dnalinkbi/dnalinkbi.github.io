# Information about Gene HPS6

## Genetic Position
HPS6 is located on the short arm of chromosome 10 (10p11.23) between genomic positions 37,005,610 and 37,113,818.

## Pathology
Mutations in the HPS6 gene are associated with an autosomal recessive disorder known as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 6 (HPS6), which is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding disorders, and pulmonary fibrosis.

## Function
The HPS6 gene encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 28463
- NCBI Entrez: 9392
- Ensembl: ENSG00000152045
- OMIM: 607522
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6R0

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several documented mutations in the HPS6 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. Some examples of missense mutations include:

- p.Gly374Asp (rs886044983)
- p.Cys452Tyr (rs796215909)
- p.Arg461His (rs886044982)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic mutations reported in the HPS6 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HPS6 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 6 (HPS6), which is a rare inherited disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for HPS6. Treatment is generally supportive and based on the symptoms present in each individual. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of complications.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically approved for the treatment of HPS6. However, various treatments have been used to manage symptoms, such as blood transfusions and pulmonary therapies.
