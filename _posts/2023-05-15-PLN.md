**Gene:** PLN

#### Information:

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 6: 45812146-45813314 on the GRCh38.p13 assembly.
- **Function:** This gene encodes a small protein called phospholamban (PLN) that regulates the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA2) in cardiac muscle cells.
- **External IDs:**
    - Gene ID: 5350
    - Genomic Location: NC_000006.12 (45812146..45813314)
    - Aliases: CMD1P, PLB
- **External Sites:**
    - HGNC: 9051
    - NCBI Entrez: 5350
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000112295
    - OMIM: 172405
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P26678
- **AA Mutation List:**

|Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID|
|---------|------|---------|
|L39Stop  |Nonsense|rs104894081|
|R9C| Missense| rs121908002|
|R14del| Deletion| rs761447634|
|E40D| Missense| rs121908003|

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

No somatic SNVs/InDels reported for this gene.

- **Related Disease:**
PLN mutations are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC).

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
There is no cure for DCM or FHC caused by PLN mutations, but treatments can help manage symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. In severe cases, heart transplant may be necessary.

- **Drug Response:**
There is limited information on drug response for PLN-related cardiomyopathies.
