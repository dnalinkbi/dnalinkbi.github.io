# Information about gene MET

## Genetic Position
The gene MET is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31).

## Pathology
Abnormalities in MET have been linked to various types of cancer, including lung, gastric, and kidney cancer. Gene amplification and activating mutations in MET have been identified as oncogenic drivers in certain cancers.

## Function
The MET gene is responsible for encoding the MET receptor tyrosine kinase protein, which is involved in cell growth, survival, and migration. The protein is activated when the cell is exposed to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ligand, leading to downstream signaling pathways that regulate cellular processes such as cell proliferation, migration, motility, and angiogenesis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Several MET inhibitors, such as crizotinib, cabozantinib, and savolitinib, have been developed and are in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers with MET aberrations. Prognosis may depend on the specific genetic alterations involved and the stage of the cancer.

## Drug Response
MET inhibitors, such as crizotinib, have shown promising results in patients with MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer. However, response to therapy may depend on the specific genetic alterations present in the tumor.
