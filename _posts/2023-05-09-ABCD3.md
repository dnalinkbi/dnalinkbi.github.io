## ABCD3 Gene Information

### Overview

ABCD3 gene also known as "ATP-binding cassette sub-family D member 3" located on chromosome 1, belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. The ABC transporters are responsible for the transport of various substrates across the cell membrane.

### Function

The ABCD3 gene encodes a protein that is located in the peroxisomal membrane known as ATP-binding cassette transporter. This transporter is involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids with a carbon chain length of 22 or 24 which is important for the beta-oxidation process taking place in the peroxisome. Defects in the ABCD3 gene cause autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA).

### Related Diseases

- Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA)

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no specific treatment for ARCA caused by the ABCD3 gene defect. Currently, the treatment of ARCA involves supportive care to manage symptoms.
- The prognosis for ARCA is poor as the disorder leads to progressive impairment in cerebellar function.

### Drug Response

- There is no information available regarding drug response with ABCD3 gene or ARCA.
