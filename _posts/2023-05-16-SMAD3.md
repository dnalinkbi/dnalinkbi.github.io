# Gene SMAD3
### Genetic Position and Pathology
* The SMAD3 gene is located on chromosome 15q22.33.
* Mutations in the SMAD3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including hypertension, thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, and osteoarthritis.

### Function
* The SMAD3 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway.
* This protein plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### External IDs and Aliases
* HGNC: 6774
* NCBI Entrez: 4088
* Ensembl: ENSG00000166949
* OMIM: 603109
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P84022
* Aliases: HSPC193, MADH3, MADR3, SMAD3B

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
* Several variants have been identified in the SMAD3 gene, including:
  * p.Arg262Leu (rs3753348)
  * p.Arg280His (rs2229462)
  * p.Pro331Leu (rs28381998)
  * These mutations are missense mutations, which result in the replacement of one amino acid with another.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
* Somatic mutations in the SMAD3 gene have been reported in several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
* Some examples of somatic mutations with dbSNP ID are:
  * c.1184G>A (rs10452309)
  * c.1198C>T (rs78153652)
  * c.1253C>A (rs28569689)

### Related Disease
* Mutations in the SMAD3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
  * Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 3
  * Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
  * Systemic Sclerosis
  * Aortic Aneurysm
  * Hypertension

### Treatment and Prognosis
* The treatment and prognosis for individuals with mutations in the SMAD3 gene will depend on the specific disease and symptoms that are present.
* Medical management is usually focused on addressing symptoms and complications, such as high blood pressure or aortic dilation.

### Drug Response
* Information on how SMAD3 gene mutations may impact drug response is limited.
* However, one study has suggested that targeting the TGF-beta/SMAD3 pathway may be a potential therapeutic option for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.
