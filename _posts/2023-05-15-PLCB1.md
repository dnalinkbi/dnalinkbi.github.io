# Information about gene PLCB1

## Genetic Position
PLCB1 is located on chromosome 20 at the position 20p12.2.

## Pathology
PLCB1 has been associated with various diseases and conditions such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.

## Function
The PLCB1 gene encodes for the enzyme phospholipase C beta, which is involved in the intracellular signal transduction pathway. This pathway is crucial for a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.
