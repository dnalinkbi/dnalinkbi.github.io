# Gene Information for ADCY6

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

### Gene Position
The ADCY6 gene is located on Chromosome 12q13.13.

### Pathology
Mutations in the ADCY6 gene have been associated with various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.

### Function
The ADCY6 gene encodes for an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), which plays a role in intracellular signaling pathways and regulates the production of the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP).
