## Information on Gene TNNT3

### Genetic Position

The gene TNNT3 is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11p15.4.

### Pathology

Mutations in the TNNT3 gene have been associated with various cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and nemaline myopathy. 

### Function

The TNNT3 gene encodes the protein Troponin T type 3, which is involved in regulating muscle contraction. Troponin T binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on actin filaments, allowing the myosin head to interact with actin and generate force.
