# Information about gene STEAP3

## Genetic Position
- Gene name: STEAP3 (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3)
- Chromosomal location: 2p25.3
- DNA/RNA Sequence ID: NC_000002.12, NG_017034.1
- Protein Sequence ID: NP_060851.5
- Aliases: STAMPB, TSAP6, STAMP2B 

## Pathology and Function
- Function: STEAP3 gene encodes a member of the STEAP (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate) protein family. This protein is a cell-surface antigen and is highly expressed in various types of cancers. It is involved in multiple physiological processes such as iron metabolism, cell proliferation, and survival. 
- Related diseases: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer
- Treatment and prognosis: There is no specific treatment for STEAP3-associated diseases, however, targeting STEAP3 may be a promising strategy for anticancer therapy.
- Drug response: Some preclinical studies have shown that targeting STEAP3 with specific antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors can effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells.
