# Information about Gene LGALS2

## Genetic Position
- LGALS2 is located on the human chromosome 22q13.1.

## Pathology
- LGALS2 has been associated with various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammation.

## Function for Gene
- LGALS2 encodes for galectin-2, which is a member of the galectin family. Galectin-2 is known to participate in cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.

## External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: 6909, NCBI Entrez: 3959, Ensembl: ENSG00000100292, OMIM: 153619, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P05161.
- Aliases: GAL2, GALBP.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are several amino acid (AA) mutations associated with LGALS2, including:
     - V85A: rs3765408
     - R186H: rs2229186
     - T147M: rs17886427
- These mutations are missense mutations in the LGALS2 gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels associated with LGALS2, including:
     - rs3128935
     - rs3130318
     - rs3087485
- These SNVs/InDels are associated with various cancers such as breast, lung, and liver cancer.

## Related Disease
