# Information about Gene TRIO

### Genetic Position
The TRIO gene is located on chromosome 5q34 and spans approximately 356.53 kb.

### Pathology
Mutations in the TRIO gene have been associated with various disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and cancer. 

### Function 
The TRIO gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho and Rac family of small GTPases. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and axon/dendrite outgrowth.
