# Information about gene SNIP1

## Genetic Position
- SNIP1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q25.3).

## Pathology
- SNIP1 is not known to cause any genetic disorders or diseases. However, it has been associated with different physiological processes and pathways.

## Function
- SNIP1 gene encodes for a transcription factor that is involved in different biological processes, including embryonic development, skeletal muscle differentiation, and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 11051
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 8723
- Ensembl: ENSG00000173666
- OMIM: 608385
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6X8
- Aliases: SIP1, SIP2, SMADIP1, ZEB3BP, ZFHX1B

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are different mutations reported for the SNIP1 gene, including missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations. 
- Some of the reported missense mutations and their dbSNP IDs are:
    - p.Gly238Arg, rs149832216
    - p.Leu402Pro, rs76703483
    - p.Arg441Gln, rs369051150
- Frameshift and nonsense mutations usually lead to non-functional proteins or truncated proteins.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs and InDels reported for SNIP1 gene in different types of cancers, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
- Some of the reported somatic SNVs and their dbSNP IDs are:
    - c.398G>A, rs12060754
    - c.1019A>G, rs764965605
    - c.1542C>T, rs767884693

## Related Disease
- SNIP1 gene is not known to cause any genetic disorders or diseases. However, it has been associated with different physiological processes and pathways.
- SNIP1 has been also associated with cancer progression and metastasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- As SNIP1 is not known to cause any genetic disorders or diseases, there is no specific treatment or prognosis associated with its mutation or dysregulation.
- However, SNIP1 dysregulation has been associated with cancer progression, and it could be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

## Drug Response
- There are no specific drugs known to target SNIP1 gene.
