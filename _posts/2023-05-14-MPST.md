# Gene MPST

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 22q13.33
- **Pathology:** The MPST gene is associated with different types of cancer and metabolic syndromes such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
- **Function:** The MPST gene encodes mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, a cytosolic enzyme that converts sulfide and alpha-ketoglutarate into pyruvate and thiosulfate. This gene plays a critical role in hydrogen sulfide metabolism and detoxification.
- **Aliases:** 3MST, MST, MSTP, SRT2

## External IDs
- **HGNC:** 7417
- **NCBI Entrez:** 4355
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000130708
- **OMIM:** 607485
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P25325

- Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
- Colorectal Cancer
- Type 2 Diabetes

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment available for MPST mutations directly. The treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of related diseases such as cancer and diabetes.
- The prognosis of MPST mutations varies depending on the associated disorder and severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug available that targets MPST mutations.
- Some drugs, such as metformin, have been shown to improve insulin resistance and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
