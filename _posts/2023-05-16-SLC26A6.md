# Information about Gene SLC26A6

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

The SLC26A6 gene, also known as solute carrier family 26 member 6, is located on chromosome 3q22.1. This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the sulfate anion transporter family. SLC26A6 protein is involved in the transport of various anions, including sulfate, oxalate, and bicarbonate.

SLC26A6 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including kidney stones, hypertension, and cancer. This gene is expressed in various tissues and organs, including the kidney, intestine, and liver.
