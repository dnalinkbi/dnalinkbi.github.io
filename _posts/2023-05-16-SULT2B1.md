## Gene SULT2B1

### Genetic Position

The SULT2B1 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.33.

### Pathology

The SULT2B1 gene is associated with various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and endometrial cancers. Several studies have shown that the expression of SULT2B1 is decreased in these cancers, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor.

### Function

The SULT2B1 gene encodes a sulfotransferase enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of cholesterol and other steroids. Specifically, it catalyzes the sulfonation of 3beta-hydroxysteroids, which is a key step in steroid hormone inactivation and elimination.

### AA Mutation List

No pathogenic or likely-pathogenic variants have been identified in the SULT2B1 gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

Several somatic SNVs and InDels in the SULT2B1 gene have been identified in various cancers, including breast and endometrial cancers, but their exact role in cancer development and progression is still unclear.

### Related Disease

The SULT2B1 gene is associated with various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and endometrial cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Given the potential role of SULT2B1 as a tumor suppressor, restoring its expression or activity may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, more research is needed to fully understand its role in cancer and its potential therapeutic value.

### Drug Response

No specific drugs targeting SULT2B1 are currently available for clinical use. However, some drugs used for cancer treatment, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, may indirectly affect SULT2B1 expression or activity.
