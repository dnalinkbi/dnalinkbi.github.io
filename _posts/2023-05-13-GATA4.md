## Gene GATA4

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 8
- Location: 8p23.1

### Pathology
- Mutations in the GATA4 gene have been associated with various types of congenital heart diseases, including atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect.

### Function
- GATA4 encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in the development and differentiation of cardiac and gut tissues. It regulates various genes involved in heart and digestive system development.
