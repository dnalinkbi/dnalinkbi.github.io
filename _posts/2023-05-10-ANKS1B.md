# Gene Information Analysis for ANKS1B

## Gene Position and Basic Information
- **Gene Name**: Ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 1B (ANKS1B)
- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 11 (11q13.3) 
- **Aliases**: AKS1B, ANKS1, KIAA1811

## Gene Function
ANKS1B encodes a protein that contains ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, both of which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The exact function of ANKS1B is unknown, but studies suggest that it may play a role in brain development and the formation of axons and dendrites.

## External IDs and Sites
- **HGNC ID**: HGNC:23850
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID**: 9757
- **Ensembl Gene ID**: ENSG00000181588
- **OMIM ID**: 610544
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID**: Q8TF46

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels currently listed in dbSNP for ANKS1B.

## Related Diseases
There is limited research on the association between ANKS1B and human disease, and no diseases have been directly linked to ANKS1B mutations. However, studies have suggested a possible association with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
As there are no known diseases directly linked to ANKS1B mutations, treatment and prognosis are not yet applicable.

## Drug Response
As there are no known diseases directly linked to ANKS1B mutations, drug response information is not yet applicable.
