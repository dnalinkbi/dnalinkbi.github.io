## Information about gene MMP20

**Genetic position**: Chromosome 11: 119,619,473 - 119,625,834

**Pathology**: Mutations in MMP20 gene can lead to dentinogenesis imperfecta type II, which is a genetic disorder affecting tooth development.

**Function**: MMP20 gene encodes for an enzyme called Matrix metalloproteinase-20 that helps to degrade enamel matrix proteins during tooth development.

**External IDs and Aliases**:
- HGNC: 7179
- NCBI Entrez: 9312
- Ensembl: ENSG00000172746
- OMIM: 604629
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60882

**AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID**:
- R4Q - Missense - rs72558111
- D180Y - Missense - rs61751073
- G223D - Missense - rs386352911

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported

**Related disease**: Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II

**Treatment and prognosis**: There is no specific cure or treatment for dentinogenesis imperfecta, but dental management can help to improve the appearance and function of affected teeth.

**Drug response**: There is no known drug that can specifically target MMP20 gene.
