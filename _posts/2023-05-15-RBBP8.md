# Gene: RBBP8

## Information

RBBP8 gene is located on chromosome 18q11.2 and encodes Retinoblastoma-binding protein 8, which is also known as CtIP (C-terminal binding protein interacting protein). This protein plays a vital role in DNA repair mechanisms, G1 to S transition, and genomic instability.

## Related disease

Mutations in the RBBP8 gene have been linked to the development of various human malignancies. RBBP8 gene mutations have been reported to lead to genomic instability, which can lead to the development of cancer. The chromosome instability syndrome, Seckel Syndrome, has also been linked to RBBP8 gene mutations.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no targeted therapy available for patients with RBBP8 gene mutations. The prognosis for patients with RBBP8 gene mutations varies depending on the type of cancer and the severity of the mutation.

## Drug response

There have been no drugs specifically designed to target RBBP8 gene mutations. Studies have shown that PARP inhibitors can be effective in treating certain types of cancers that have a mutation in the RBBP8 gene.
