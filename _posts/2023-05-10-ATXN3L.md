### Gene ATXN3L

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome X: 51,837,468-51,839,620 

**Pathology:** ATXN3L is a member of the ataxin family of deubiquitinating enzymes, which are involved in protein degradation pathways. The mutation in this gene is associated with X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's disease.

**Function:** ATXN3L plays a role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by regulating the levels of polyubiquitin chains on target proteins.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for this gene. 

**Related Diseases:**

- Kennedy's disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy)

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Currently, there is no cure for Kennedy's disease. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, focused on managing the symptoms of the disease. Physical therapy and/or assistive devices may also be helpful. The prognosis of the disease varies depending on the age of onset and severity of symptoms. 

**Drug Response:**

There is no specific drug targeted at Kennedy's disease. However, some medications may help in managing symptoms such as spasticity, cramps, and erectile dysfunction.
