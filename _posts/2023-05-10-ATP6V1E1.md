# Genetic Information Analysis Report: Gene ATP6V1E1

## Gene Information
- Pathology: ATP6V1E1 is a gene that encodes the E1 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This complex is involved in the acidification of intracellular compartments, including organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes. ATP6V1E1 is located on chromosome 22q11.21 and is composed of 10 exons.
- Function: The V-ATPase complex plays an essential role in various cellular processes, such as protein degradation, pH regulation, and neurotransmitter release. ATP6V1E1 is a crucial subunit of this complex and is responsible for the proton translocation across the membrane.
- Aliases: ATP6V1E, ATP6N1, ATP6N1A, ATP6N1E, DKFZp686E19102, V-ATPase E1 subunit, and V-type proton ATPase subunit E

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No somatic variants are currently reported for the ATP6V1E1 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in ATP6V1E1 have been associated with several diseases, including:
    - Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA): It is a rare hereditary disease characterized by impaired renal acid secretion.
    - Osteopetrosis: It is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the bones' remodeling process, leading to brittle bones and an increased risk of fractures.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, no targeted treatments are available for ATP6V1E1-related diseases. The treatment mainly focuses on managing the symptoms, such as metabolic acidosis and bone fractures.
- The prognosis for individuals with ATP6V1E1 mutations depends on the severity of the disease. In cases of severe dRTA, long-term management, such as daily alkali therapy, is required.

## Drug Response
- No specific drug response is reported for ATP6V1E1.
