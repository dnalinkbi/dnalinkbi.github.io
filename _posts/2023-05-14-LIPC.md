## Gene: LIPC

- Function: LIPC encodes hepatic triglyceride lipase which is an enzyme that helps in hydrolysis of triglycerides, lipoprotein lipase generated fatty acids, efficiently removes high-density lipoproteins and reduced proteoglycan binding with low-density lipoproteins.

- Related disease: 
    - LIPC deficiency: genetic disorder caused due to mutations in the LIPC gene leading to the deficiency of hepatic triglyceride lipase. It causes an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 
    - Cardiovascular disease: Studies suggest that LIPC deficiency could be linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.

- Treatment and prognosis: 
    - For LIPC deficiency, treatment includes a low-fat diet, regular exercise, and lipid-lowering medications. 
    - The prognosis depends on the individual case and severity of the condition.

- Drug response: Studies suggest that LIPC variants might impact the response to lipid-lowering drugs.
