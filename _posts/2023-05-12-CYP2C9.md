## Gene Information

The gene CYP2C9 encodes the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and phenytoin.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified for this gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in CYP2C9 have been associated with altered drug metabolism, which can result in adverse drug reactions. Additionally, some studies have linked certain CYP2C9 variants with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and reduced efficacy of warfarin.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Individuals with CYP2C9 mutations may require dose adjustments or alternative medications to avoid adverse drug reactions. However, the prognosis is generally good with appropriate management.

## Drug Response

CYP2C9 variants have been associated with altered drug metabolism and response. For example, individuals with certain CYP2C9 variants may require lower doses of warfarin to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.
