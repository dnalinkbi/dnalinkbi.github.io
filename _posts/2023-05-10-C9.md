# Information about Gene C9

## Genomic Location and External IDs

- Genomic location: Chromosome 9, q21.31
- Gene name: C9orf72
- Aliases: ALSFTD, FLJ50651

External IDs:
- HGNC: HGNC:29243
- NCBI Entrez: 203228
- Ensembl: ENSG00000198691
- OMIM: 614260
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: G4V1K9


## Function

The C9orf72 gene encodes a protein whose precise function is not fully understood. However, it is believed to play a role in vesicle transport, autophagy, and RNA binding.

## Mutation Information

- AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are various known mutations in the C9orf72 gene which can result in the development of different diseases. The most common type is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the non-coding region of the gene. This expansion leads to abnormal RNA transcripts in the brain and spinal cord, which causes the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD).

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are somatic mutations in the C9orf72 gene associated with various cancer types, but these are not well understood.

## Related Diseases

The most commonly associated diseases are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no known cure for diseases caused by C9orf72 mutations. Treatment is usually focused on managing symptoms and maintaining quality of life. The prognosis for individuals with these mutations can vary depending on the specific disease and its progression.

## Drug Response

Research is ongoing to investigate potential drug therapies for C9orf72-related diseases. However, there are currently no drugs specifically targeting C9orf72 mutations.
