## Gene Information:
The MYT1L gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2p25.3) and encodes for the protein Myelin transcription factor 1-like protein.

### Function:
The MYT1L protein is a transcription factor that plays a role in the development of the nervous system, specifically in the development of oligodendrocytes and myelin.
