# Gene AIMP1

## Genetic Position
Gene AIMP1 (Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1), also known as EMAP2 (Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide 2), is located on chromosome 4q21.1.

## Pathology and Function
AIMP1 gene encodes a multifunctional protein which is part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. It has been observed to be dysregulated in a wide range of cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer, among others. Additionally, AIMP1 has been found to modulate immune responses such as activating T-cells and promoting angiogenesis.
