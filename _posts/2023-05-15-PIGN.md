# Information on Gene PIGN

## Genetic Position
- The gene PIGN is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 at position 11.31 (18q11.31).

## Pathology
- Mutations in the PIGN gene are associated with many genetic disorders characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and multiple congenital anomalies.

## Function
- The PIGN gene encodes for a protein that is involved in the assembly of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which aid membrane attachment of many proteins on the surface of cells.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no specific treatment for genetic disorders caused by mutations in the PIGN gene.
- Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, tailored to the specific needs of the individual.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the associated anomalies and developmental delay.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug that targets the PIGN gene for therapy.
