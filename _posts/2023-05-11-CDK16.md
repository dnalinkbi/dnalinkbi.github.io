# Information about Gene CDK16

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 16 (CDK16)
- Chromosome: 15
- Location: q22.1
- Pathology: Unknown

## Function
The CDK16 gene encodes for a protein that belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase family. This protein is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, transcription, and RNA processing.
