### Function for Gene

MYOD1 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in skeletal muscle development and differentiation. It activates genes that are necessary for the differentiation of myoblasts (muscle precursor cells) into myotubes (muscle fibers), including genes that regulate muscle fiber type and muscle contraction.

### Related Disease, Treatment, Prognosis, and Drug Response

Germline mutations in MYOD1 are not known to be associated with any diseases. However, somatic mutations in MYOD1 have been identified in a subset of human tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma and lung cancer.

The prognosis and treatment options for patients with MYOD1 mutations depend on the type and stage of cancer. Targeted therapies that specifically target MYOD1 are not currently available, though some chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to be effective in treating rhabdomyosarcoma.
