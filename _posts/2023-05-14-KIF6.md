# Gene: KIF6

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 6
- Location: 6q25.3

## Pathology 
The KIF6 gene has been implicated in multiple diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and cancer.

## Function 
KIF6 encodes a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-associated molecular motors. The protein plays a role in intracellular transport and may be involved in processes such as signal transduction, mRNA localization, and spindle formation during mitosis.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Trp719Arg rs429358
- p.[Trp719Arg;Ile354Thr] rs3745274

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNV/InDels listed in dbSNP, including:
- rs10038177
- rs16858821
- rs10423927
- rs9282563

## Related Disease
The KIF6 gene has been associated with several diseases, including:
- Coronary artery disease
- Stroke 
- Cancer 

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for KIF6-associated diseases vary depending on the condition and individual patient factors. 

## Drug Response 
Some studies have suggested that individuals with a particular variant of KIF6 may respond differently to statin therapy for prevention of cardiovascular disease.
