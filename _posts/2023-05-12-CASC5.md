# Information about Gene CASC5

## Genetic Position

The CASC5 gene (Cancer Susceptibility 5) is located on chromosome 15q15.1 and has a genomic size of approximately 218.89 kilobases.

## Pathology

CASC5 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitotic spindle formation, regulation of the cell cycle, and DNA damage repair. It is also known to be associated with several types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, cervical, and gastric cancer. Studies have shown that abnormal expression or mutations in CASC5 can contribute to carcinogenesis and cancer progression.

## Function

CASC5 plays an essential role in the formation and regulation of the mitotic spindle apparatus during cell division. It interacts with other spindle-associated proteins, such as BUB1 and MAD2L1, and contributes to the proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.

## Related Disease

Mutations and abnormal expression of CASC5 have been linked to several types of cancer, including:

- Breast Cancer
- Colorectal Cancer
- Cervical Cancer
- Gastric Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

As CASC5 is involved in various cellular processes that contribute to cancer development and progression, targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting CASC5 function have shown promise in preclinical studies. However, further research is necessary to establish the potential clinical applications of CASC5 as a therapeutic target.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information about drug response and CASC5.
