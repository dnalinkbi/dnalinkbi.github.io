## Gene DDIT3

**Function**: The DDIT3 gene encodes a protein known as DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 or growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 153 protein (GADD153). This protein is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and is known to play a critical role in regulating cellular stress and various physiological and pathological processes.
