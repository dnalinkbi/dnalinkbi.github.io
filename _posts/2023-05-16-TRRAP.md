# Information about Gene TRRAP

## Genetic Position
- TRRAP (Transformation/Transcription Domain-Associated Protein) is located on chromosome 7 at position 7q22.1.

## Pathology and Function
- TRRAP is a multi-functional protein involved in various cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control.
- It is a core component of several histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, including the PCAF and SAGA complexes, which regulate gene expression by modifying chromatin structure.
- Dysregulation of TRRAP has been linked to various diseases, including cancer.

- The type of mutations includes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in TRRAP from various types of cancer, including leukemia, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, among others.
- Some common examples are:
    - c.1929_1933delCAAGA (rs1057519958)
    - c.6325C>G (rs786205171)
- These somatic mutations have dbSNP IDs.

## Related Disease
- Dysregulation of TRRAP has been implicated in various types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, among others.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- TRRAP is considered a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, particularly for leukemia.
- Its prognostic significance in cancer patients is still under investigation.

## Drug Response
- There are currently no targeted drugs available that specifically target TRRAP, although some drugs have shown potential to affect its activity indirectly.
