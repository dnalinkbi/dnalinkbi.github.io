# Gene: RAB7A

## Genetic Position
RAB7A is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q21.3-q22.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in the RAB7A gene have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (CMT2B), a progressive disorder that affects the peripheral nerves responsible for movement and sensation.

## Function
RAB7A encodes a member of the Rab family of small GTPases. It plays a key role in intracellular trafficking, mediating the transport of proteins and lipids between organelles in the endocytic and secretory pathways. RAB7A is involved in the late stages of endosomal maturation, promoting the fusion of endosomes with lysosomes and autophagosomes.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

## Related Diseases
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B
- Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 7

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for CMT2B, and treatment is supportive. Management may include physical therapy, orthopedic devices, and pain management.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug treatment for CMT2B specifically, but several pharmacological agents have been investigated as potential therapies.
