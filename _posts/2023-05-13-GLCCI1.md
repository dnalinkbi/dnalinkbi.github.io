## Gene GLCCI1:

### Genetic position:
The GLCCI1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position 7p22.1.

### Pathology:
The mutations in GLCCI1 gene are associated with susceptibility to asthma and response to asthma treatment.

### Function for gene:
The GLCCI1 gene encodes for a protein that negatively regulates glucocorticoid-induced gene expression in airway epithelial cells. It has a role in the regulation of inflammation and immune response, particularly in the lungs.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several mutations reported in the GLCCI1 gene for asthma susceptibility and treatment response, including:
- rs37972 (p.Thr556Ile)
- rs37973 (p.Gly570Ala)
- rs37975 (p.Gly165Ala)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
Not available.

### Related disease:
GLCCI1 gene mutations are associated with asthma susceptibility and response to asthma treatment.

### Treatment and prognosis:
The response to asthma treatment may vary depending on the mutation present in the GLCCI1 gene. Further studies are required to confirm the clinical significance of these mutations in asthma treatment and prognosis.

### Drug response:
No specific drug response has been identified for GLCCI1 gene mutations.
