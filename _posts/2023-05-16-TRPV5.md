# Gene: TRPV5

## Genetic Position
The TRPV5 gene is located on chromosome 7q35 and spans approximately 70.5 kb.

## Pathology and Function
The TRPV5 gene codes for a calcium ion channel protein that is primarily expressed in the kidneys and plays a crucial role in regulating calcium reabsorption in the renal tubules. Mutations in the TRPV5 gene have been associated with disorders such as hypocalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis.

## Related Disease
Mutations in TRPV5 have been associated with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by high levels of calcium in the blood due to decreased excretion of calcium in the urine.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia typically involves monitoring calcium levels and may include medication to manage symptoms. Prognosis is generally good, as the condition is typically not life-threatening.

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug therapy for TRPV5-related disorders.
