# Information about Gene POU5F1

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: POU5F1 (POU class 5 homeobox 1)
- Chromosome: 6
- Location: 6p21.3
- Pathology: mutations in POU5F1 are associated with embryonal carcinoma, testicular germ cell tumor, and other germ cell tumors.

## Function
- POU5F1 encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.
- Functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that binds to the octamer motif (5'-ATTTGCAT-3') and regulates the expression of target genes.
- Involved in the regulation of genes required for cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 9239
- NCBI Entrez: 5460
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163932
- OMIM: 164177
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01860

## AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID and Mutation Type
- p.Ala178Val (rs104894791): Missense
- p.Gln226Lys (rs3098140): Missense
- p.Asn220His (rs28940705): Missense

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs202166256 (c.637C>T): SNV
- rs267607214 (c.1021G>C): SNV
- rs267607215 (c.659C>G): SNV

## Related Disease
- Embryonal Carcinoma
- Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumor
- Ovarian Germ Cell Tumor
- Yolk Sac Tumor

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: depends on the extent of the cancer
- Prognosis: varies depending on the stage and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- The response to chemotherapy is often favorable in patients with germ cell tumors.
