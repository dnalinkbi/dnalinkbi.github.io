# Gene PER2

### Information
- **Genetic Position**: 2q37.3
- **Pathology**: PER2 gene mutations have been associated with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24SWD).
- **Function**: The PER2 gene is involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm by controlling the expression and stability of certain proteins.
- **Aliases**: Period circadian protein homolog 2, hPer2

### External IDs
- **HGNC**: 8826
- **NCBI Entrez**: 8864
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000132639
- **OMIM**: 603943
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: O15055

### AA Mutation List
There are several known mutations in the PER2 gene that have been associated with sleep disorders, including:
- c.1357G>A (p.Ala453Thr) rs2304674
- c.523G>T (p.Val175Phe) rs228697
- c.2536C>T (p.Pro846Ser) rs2304676
- c.1941C>G (p.Pro647Arg) rs10462020

### Somatic SNVs/InDels 
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the PER2 gene.

### Related Diseases
- Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD)
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
- Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24SWD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for sleep disorders associated with PER2 mutations vary depending on the specific disorder and individual case. Generally, treatment may include light therapy, behavioral therapy, medication, and changes in sleep habits. Prognosis can also vary and is dependent on several factors, including the specific sleep disorder, severity of symptoms, and response to treatment.

### Drug Response
There is limited research on drug response in individuals with PER2 mutations and sleep disorders. However, some studies have suggested that chronotherapy may be effective in improving sleep patterns in individuals with DSPD.
