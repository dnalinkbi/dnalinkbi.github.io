# Gene: LRSAM1 

## Genetic Position 
LRSAM1 (Leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1) is located on the human chromosome 9q33.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in LRSAM1 gene encoding proteins have been found to be associated with several diseases including:
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- Autosomal-dominant Deafness.

## Function 
LRSAM1 acts as an ubiquitin ligase E3, and is necessary for the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins during cellular processes like endocytosis and mitosis.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no standard treatment that can cure the genetic disorders caused by LRSAM1 mutations. However, symptomatic treatment is provided to manage the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Autosomal-dominant Deafness.

## Drug Response
The information about drug response is currently not available for LRSAM1.
