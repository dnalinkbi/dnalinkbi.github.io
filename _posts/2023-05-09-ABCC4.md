# Information about Gene ABCC4

## Gene Position and Function
- The ABCC4 gene is located on chromosome 13 at the position 13q32.1.
- The gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 4 protein, which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. 
- The protein functions as an efflux pump for a variety of substrates, including drugs, lipids, and glucuronides, and is involved in the regulation of intracellular levels of various substances.

## Related Disease
- ABCC4 dysfunction has been associated with various diseases, including:
  - Diabetes mellitus type 2
  - Alzheimer's disease
  - Breast cancer
  - Multiple myeloma
  - Pancreatic adenocarcinoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for ABCC4-related diseases vary based on the specific disease and the patient's condition.
- Prognosis also depends on the underlying disease and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- ABCC4 is known to play a role in drug resistance in various cancers, including breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
- There is ongoing research to develop drugs that target ABCC4 in order to overcome drug resistance.
