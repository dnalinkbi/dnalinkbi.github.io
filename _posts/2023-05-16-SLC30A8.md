# Gene SLC30A8

## Information

Gene SLC30A8 is located on chromosome 8 at position 118.68 - 118.75 Mb. It encodes for a zinc transporter protein, which plays a key role in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. 

## Function

The function of the SLC30A8 gene is to transport zinc ions into insulin-containing vesicles within pancreatic beta cells. This process is critical in regulating insulin secretion in response to glucose levels in the blood.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for gene SLC30A8.

## Related disease

SLC30A8 has been associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in several populations worldwide. Additionally, rare genetic mutations in the SLC30A8 gene have been identified in individuals with neonatal diabetes and other forms of monogenic diabetes.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no known cure for type 2 diabetes, but it can be managed through lifestyle changes, medication, and insulin therapy. Additionally, ongoing research is focused on developing therapies that target the SLC30A8 pathway, which could potentially lead to new treatments for diabetes.

## Drug response

Several drugs that target the SLC30A8 pathway are currently in development for the treatment of diabetes, including compounds that inhibit the zinc transporter activity of the SLC30A8 protein.
