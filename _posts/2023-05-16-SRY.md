## Gene SRY

### Genetic Position
The SRY gene is located on the short arm of the Y chromosome (Yp11.3).

### Pathology
Mutations or deletions in the SRY gene can affect male sex determination, resulting in female or ambiguous genitalia (46,XY disorders of sex development).

### Function
The SRY gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in male sex determination. It activates the expression of genes involved in the development of the testes and other male-specific structures.

### Related Disease
46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for 46,XY DSD depends on the specific condition and can include hormone therapy, surgery, and psychological support. The prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the timeliness of treatment.

### Drug Response
