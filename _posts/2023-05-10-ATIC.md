## Gene ATIC

### Genetic Position
The ATIC (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q35), at base pair position 216,930,158 to 217,056,412.

### Function for Gene
The ATIC gene provides instructions for creating the ATIC protein which is involved in the purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. This protein is a bifunctional enzyme that possesses two enzymatic activities, formyltransferase and cyclohydrolase. The formyltransferase activity of the ATIC protein converts 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) to 5-formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR). The cyclohydrolase activity of this protein converts inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), the precursor of guanosine nucleotides.

### Pathology
Mutations in the ATIC gene have been associated with AICA-ribosiduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of AICAR in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma of affected individuals. This disease is caused by a deficiency in the ATIC protein's formyltransferase activity.
