## Gene: GALNT14

**Function:** GALNT14 encodes a member of the UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family of enzymes. It is involved in O-linked glycosylation and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of mucin-type glycoproteins.

**Related disease:** GALNT14 expression is dysregulated in various cancers including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for cancers with dysregulated GALNT14 expression may involve targeting the glycosylation pathway. However, more research is needed to determine the best approach for therapeutically targeting this pathway.

**Drug response:** Currently, there is no drug specifically targeted towards GALNT14. However, drugs that target the glycosylation pathway and inhibit O-glycosylation could be potentially beneficial in the treatment of cancers with dysregulated GALNT14 expression.
