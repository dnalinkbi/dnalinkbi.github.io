## Gene: NR2E3

### Information

- **Position:** Chromosome 15: 30,041,607-30,046,097
- **Pathology:** Mutations in NR2E3 have been linked to several retinal diseases such as enhanced S-cone syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and Goldman-Favre syndrome.
- **Function:** NR2E3 is a nuclear receptor that regulates the development and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina.
