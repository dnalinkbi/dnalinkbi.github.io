# Information about Gene PDZD7

## Genetic Position
PDZD7 is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 10 (10p15-p14).

## Pathology
PDZD7 mutations are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically DFNB57 deafness, which is characterized by prelingual, severe-to-profound hearing loss.

## Function
PDZD7 encodes a protein that belongs to the PDZ domain-containing protein family. PDZ domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are commonly found in scaffolding proteins that organize and assemble signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. PDZD7 protein is found in the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear and is believed to play a role in the maintenance and development of these structures.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported for PDZD7:
- c.158C>T p.(Arg53Ter) rs751427481
- c.884_885del p.(Gly295AlafsTer34) rs746895097
- c.235C>T p.(Pro79Leu) rs374932458
- c.487A>G p.(Asn163Ser) rs78355627

All the above mutations are reported as pathogenic.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for PDZD7.

## Related Disease
PDZD7 mutations are associated with DFNB57 deafness, which is a form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for DFNB57 deafness. Hearing aids and cochlear implants may be helpful for some individuals. The prognosis for individuals with DFNB57 deafness depends on the severity of their hearing loss and the presence of other medical conditions.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with PDZD7 mutations.
