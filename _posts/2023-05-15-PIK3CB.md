# Gene Information for PIK3CB

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

- **Genetic Position:** PIK3CB (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Beta) is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q22.1).

- **Pathology:** Mutations in PIK3CB are associated with various diseases including cancer, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders.

- **Function:** PIK3CB is a catalytic subunit of the PI3K enzyme which plays a role in various cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and metabolism. It is involved in the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides, which are important signaling molecules.
