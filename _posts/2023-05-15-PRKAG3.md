## Gene: PRKAG3

### External IDs and Aliases
- **Gene ID**: 7855
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 2: 162,927,606-162,939,699
- **Aliases**: AMPK-Î³3, AMPKG3, MGC126800

### Function
PRKAG3 encodes for a regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which plays a critical role in regulating energy metabolism in response to cellular stress. PRKAG3 is specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and is involved in the regulation of muscle glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation.

No somatic variants reported in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
PRKAG3 mutations have been associated with glycogen storage disease type XI (also known as Danon disease) which is a rare genetic disorder that affects skeletal muscle, the heart, and other organs. This disease is characterized by the excessive accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissue, leading to muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and liver damage.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for glycogen storage disease type XI, and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. Treatment may include medications for heart failure, pacemakers for arrhythmias, and physical therapy for muscle weakness. The prognosis for this disease depends on the severity of symptoms and the age of onset, with early-onset cases typically having a poorer prognosis.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug therapy for glycogen storage disease type XI, although several drugs are being investigated for their potential therapeutic effects.
