## Gene Information

### Gene Name
Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3)

### Function
PRMT3 is involved in protein arginine N-methylation, a process that plays a crucial role in chromatin regulation, signal transduction, and RNA processing.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 9397
- NCBI Entrez: 10197
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163934
- OMIM: 603246
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60678
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 2q33.3

### Aliases 
SKB1, HRMT1L3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
