# Information about Gene NFKBIA

## Genetic Position
NFKBIA (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha) is located on chromosome 14q13.1.

## Pathology
NFKBIA is associated with a number of diseases including inflammation and cancer due to its role in regulating the NF-κB pathway. Mutations in NFKBIA have also been linked to immunodeficiency syndromes.

## Function
NFKBIA encodes IκBα (inhibitor kappa B alpha) which regulates the activity of NF-κB, a transcription factor that plays a critical role in immune responses and cancer. IκBα inhibits NF-κB by sequestering it in the cytoplasm.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for diseases associated with NFKBIA mutations is dependent on the specific disease. In some cases, drugs that target the NF-κB pathway may be effective.

## Drug Response
There is evidence that NFKBIA mutations may impact drug response. For example, a study found that NFKBIA mutations were associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin in lung cancer patients.
