# Information about Gene HLX

## Genetic Position:
The HLX gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.1 (1p36.1).

## Pathology:
Aberrations in the HLX gene have been associated with several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, and pediatric neuroblastoma. HLX has also been implicated in neural development disorders.

## Function for Gene:
HLX encodes a transcription factor protein that is involved in regulating gene expression during embryonic development, hematopoiesis, and cancer progression.

## External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:
- HGNC: 4945
- NCBI Entrez: 3143
- Ensembl: ENSG00000117513
- OMIM: 605110
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43320
- Aliases: HEX, HMPH

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
Unfortunately, there is currently no available information on AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID for the HLX gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There is currently little information on somatic SNVs/InDels of the HLX gene.

## Related Disease:
Mutations in the HLX gene have been implicated in several diseases, including various types of cancer and neural development disorders.

## Treatment and prognosis:
Currently, there is no established targeted treatment for HLX-associated diseases, but treatment may vary depending on the specific disease and individual case.

## Drug response:
Response to drugs in HLX-associated diseases may vary depending on the specific disease and individual case. Further research is needed to identify potential therapeutic targets.
