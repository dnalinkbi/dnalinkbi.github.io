# Information about gene POMT2

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: POMT2 (O-Mannosyltransferase 2)
- Chromosome: 14
- Location: q24.3
- Pathology: Mutations in POMT2 are associated with autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type A14 (MDDGA14), which is a congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by brain and eye abnormalities, and muscle weakness.

## Function
- POMT2 encodes a protein involved in protein O-mannosylation, which is a post-translational modification that occurs on a specific subtype of proteins, including alpha-dystroglycan, a major component of the muscle extracellular matrix.
