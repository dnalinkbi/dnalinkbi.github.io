## Gene: FOXM1
- Function: FOXM1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation. It activates the transcription of several genes involved in cell cycle progression, mitosis, and DNA repair.

- Related disease: FOXM1 is linked to cancer, particularly breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer.
- Treatment and Prognosis: FOXM1 is a potential target for cancer therapy. Several drugs have been developed to inhibit or downregulate the expression of FOXM1. FOXM1 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in preclinical and early-phase clinical trials. Prognosis for cancer patients with high FOXM1 expression is poor, as it is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and poor survival rates.
- Drug response: Several FOXM1 inhibitors are being developed for cancer therapy, including thiostrepton, siomycin A, and FDI-6. These inhibitors have shown promising antitumor activity in preclinical studies.
