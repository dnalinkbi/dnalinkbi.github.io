# Information about gene OPN1MW

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: X
- Genomic location: Xq28
- Start position: 154,960,624
- End position: 154,965,791

## Pathology
- Gene OPN1MW has been associated with color vision deficiency (CVD), an inherited disorder that affects the ability to distinguish certain colors, particularly reds and greens.

## Function
- Gene OPN1MW is involved in the encoding of the cone opsin for medium-to-long wavelength sensitive (M/L) cone cells in the retina.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no record of somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

## Related disease
- Deuteranopia - CVD in which green is shifted towards red
- Protanopia - CVD in which red is shifted towards green

## Treatment and prognosis
- There is no cure for CVD, but therapies like color vision aids and gene therapy are under development.

## Drug response
- There is no standard drug treatment available for CVD.
