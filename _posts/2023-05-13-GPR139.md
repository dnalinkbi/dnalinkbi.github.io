# Gene Information Analysis for GPR139

## Gene Information 

The GPR139 gene is located on the human chromosome 16 (16q21) at the genetic position 16:55811725-55829326. It encodes for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 139 protein. 

## Function for gene

The biological function of GPR139 is not completely understood. However, it is believed to play a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels and signaling pathways affecting dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain.
