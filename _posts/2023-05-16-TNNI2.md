# Information about Gene TNNI2

## Genetic Position
TNNI2 is located on chromosome 1 at the position q32.1.

## Pathology and Function
TNNI2 encodes for troponin I type 2, which is a protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscles. This protein is responsible for binding to actin and regulating muscle contraction. Pathological mutations in TNNI2 have been linked to several cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases.

## Related Disease
Mutations in TNNI2 have been identified in patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and nemaline myopathy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for TNNI2-related diseases varies and may include medications, surgical intervention, and lifestyle modifications. Prognosis is dependent on the specific disease and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited research on drug response specifically related to TNNI2 mutations.
