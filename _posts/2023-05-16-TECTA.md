# Gene TECTA

## Genetic Position
The TECTA gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q23.3), from base pair 116438926 to 116517609.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TECTA gene are known to cause various types of deafness, including autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment (DFNA8/12) and recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (DFNB21).

## Function for Gene
The TECTA gene provides instructions for producing the alpha-tectorin protein, which is a major component of the tectorial membrane in the inner ear. The tectorial membrane is a gel-like structure attached to the sensory cells in the cochlea, and it plays a crucial role in the process of auditory transduction, i.e. converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported in the TECTA gene to date.

## Related Disease
The mutations in the TECTA gene lead to the development of hearing impairment, which can be both dominant and recessive. DFNA8/12 and DFNB21 are autosomal dominant and recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment respectively associated with mutations in this gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for this condition. However, some treatment options such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and auditory training can help patients manage their hearing loss. The prognosis for individuals with TECTA-related hearing impairment can vary depending on the severity of the condition and individual response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There are no specific drugs available to treat TECTA-related hearing impairment. However, some drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and cisplatin have been shown to be harmful to hearing, and patients with this condition are advised to avoid their use.
