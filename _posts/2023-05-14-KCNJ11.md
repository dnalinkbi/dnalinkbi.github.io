### Gene Information
The gene in question is KCNJ11. It is located on chromosome 11 at position 11.23. KCNJ11 is associated with genetic disorders like Diabetes Mellitus, Noninsulin-Dependent and Congenital Hyperinsulinism. The function of the KCNJ11 gene is to encode for potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, which plays a crucial role in insulin secretion in the pancreas.

### External IDs and Aliases
External IDs for the KCNJ11 gene and genomic location include:
- HGNC: 6237
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 3767
- Ensembl: ENSG00000187437
- OMIM: 600937
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14654

Aliases for the KCNJ11 gene include:
- ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 11
- Beta-cell inward rectifier potassium channel
- Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir6.2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some of the AA mutations associated with the KCNJ11 gene are:
- V59M (rs5219)
- E23K (rs5215)
- I182L (rs1799884)

The mutation types are all missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no records of somatic SNVs/InDels for the KCNJ11 gene in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
The KCNJ11 gene is associated with genetic disorders like Diabetes Mellitus, Noninsulin-Dependent and Congenital Hyperinsulinism. Congenital Hyperinsulinism is a genetic disorder that causes hypoglycemia due to excess insulin secretion. Diabetes Mellitus, Noninsulin-Dependent is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with KCNJ11 gene mutations depend on the specific mutation and associated disorder. For Congenital Hyperinsulinism, medications like Diazoxide and Octreotide are used to treat hypoglycemia. In severe cases, surgery may be required to remove parts of the pancreas. For Diabetes Mellitus, Noninsulin-Dependent, the treatment typically involves medications like Metformin and lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.

### Drug Response
Some recent studies have explored the potential for KCNJ11 gene mutations to impact drug response. For example, some studies suggest that patients with the V59M mutation may respond less effectively to treatments like Sulfonylureas.
