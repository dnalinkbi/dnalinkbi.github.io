# Information about Gene APOBEC3H

## Genetic Position
APOBEC3H gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1. It spans 8.21 kb in genomic size.

## Pathology
APOBEC3H gene has been associated with various pathologies, including cancer and viral infections. Studies have suggested that it plays a role in protecting cells against retroviral infections by inducing hypermutation of the viral genome. Moreover, genetic variations in APOBEC3H gene have been shown to influence the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.

## Function
APOBEC3H (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Enzyme, Catalytic Polypeptide-Like 3H) protein is a member of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme complex. It is an interferon-inducible cytidine deaminase that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine to uridine in viral RNA. This leads to hypermutation of the viral genome and prevents the replication of the virus. APOBEC3H has also been shown to inhibit the replication of endogenous retroelements and retrotransposons in the human genome.
