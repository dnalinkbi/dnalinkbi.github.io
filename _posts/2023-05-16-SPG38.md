## Related Diseases

SPG38 is associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) which is a rare inherited neurological disorder characterized by progressive leg weakness and spasticity.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, no cure is available for HSP patients, but several treatment options are available to manage symptoms, including physical therapy, medication, and surgery. The prognosis of SPG38 remains unclear, but it generally varies depending on the age of onset, severity, and progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
