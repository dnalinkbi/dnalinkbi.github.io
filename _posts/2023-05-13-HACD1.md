## Gene HACD1

- **Genetic position**: HACD1 gene is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q23.3.

- **Aliases**: There are different aliases used for HACD1 gene, including FACL5, HACD, and HCDH.

- **Function for gene**: The HACD1 gene encodes for the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase which catalyzes the dehydration step in the pathway of very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis. VLCFAs play an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes, especially in myelin sheaths.

    - OMIM: 610679
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86V25

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: There are several mutations reported in the HACD1 gene that are associated with different diseases, including:
    - c.167-3C>A splice site mutation in HACD1 causing X-linked intellectual disability, Siderius type [rs768934068]
    - c.259G>A (p.Gly87Ser) missense mutation in HACD1 causing Perrault syndrome [rs370693456]
    - c.1183G>A (p.Gly395Arg) missense mutation in HACD1 causing X-linked intellectual disability [rs786201157]

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are somatic mutations reported in the HACD1 gene in different cancers, including breast cancer, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

- **Related disease**: Mutations in the HACD1 gene are associated with different diseases, including X-linked intellectual disability, Perrault syndrome, and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is no specific treatment available for diseases caused by mutations in the HACD1 gene. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

- **Drug response**: There is no information available on drug response related to mutations in the HACD1 gene.
