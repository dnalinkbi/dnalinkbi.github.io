# Information about gene ADA

## Genetic position, aliases, and external IDs
- Gene: ADA (Adenosine Deaminase)
- Genomic location: Chromosome 20q13.11
- Aliases: ADA1, ADAT, AHCY3
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 251
    - NCBI Entrez: 100
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000196839
    - OMIM: 608958
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P00813

## Function for gene
The ADA gene encodes the enzyme adenosine deaminase, which plays a critical role in purine metabolism by catalyzing the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively.

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: 
    - p.Asp8Val
    - p.Arg17Gln
    - p.Gly46Arg
    - p.Leu77Phe
- Mutation type: Missense mutations
- dbSNP ID: 
    - rs121912777
    - rs121912779
    - rs121912780
    - rs139146417

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: rs587776870

## Related disease
Deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA1 deficiency) results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This condition is characterized by the absence of functional T and B cells, which leads to a severely compromised immune system and a high susceptibility to infections.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment approach for ADA1 deficiency is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy. The prognosis of ADA1 deficiency depends on the severity of the disease and the timing of intervention. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a good long-term prognosis.

## Drug response
The enzyme adenosine deaminase is the target of several drugs, including pentostatin and cladribine, which are used to treat certain types of leukemia and lymphoma.
