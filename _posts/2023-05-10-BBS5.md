# Information about Gene BBS5

## Genetic Position
BBS5 gene is located on the chromosome 2q31.1-q31.2.

## Pathology
BBS5 gene is associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by obesity, retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, hypogonadism, renal abnormalities, and cognitive impairment.

## Function
BBS5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the BBSome, a complex involved in the transport of proteins to cilia. The BBSome is required for the proper functioning of cilia, which play a key role in sensing and transmitting signals in many types of cells.
