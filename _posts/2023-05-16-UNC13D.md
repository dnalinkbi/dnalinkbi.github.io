## Gene: UNC13D

### Genetic Position: 
UNC13D is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 25.1 (17q25.1).

### Pathology:
Mutations in the UNC13D gene are associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3 (FHL3), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia, among other symptoms. UNC13D mutations can lead to impaired cytotoxic granule secretion from natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which can cause uncontrolled immune activation and tissue damage in affected individuals.

### Function:
UNC13D encodes a protein called Munc13-4 that plays a critical role in controlling the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in immune cells. Munc13-4 helps to tether these granules to the plasma membrane in response to signals from activating receptors, allowing them to release their contents and destroy target cells.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no known somatic mutations in the UNC13D gene.

### Related Disease:
Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Type 3 (FHL3)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The standard treatment for FHL3 is stem cell transplantation, which can improve survival rates for affected individuals. However, the prognosis for FHL3 remains poor, with a high mortality rate. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to improving outcomes for affected individuals.

### Drug Response:
There is currently no specific drug therapy for FHL3, although immunomodulatory agents and chemotherapy may be used in some cases.
