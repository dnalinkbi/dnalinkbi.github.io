## Gene: CFAP57

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 11
- Start Position: 72,726,179 bp
- End Position: 72,757,833 bp

### Pathology
CFAP57 is associated with several genetic disorders, including:
- Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)
- Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)

### Function
CFAP57 is involved in the formation and function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that help with movement and sensing. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 26297
- NCBI Entrez: 340359
- Ensembl: ENSG00000223399
- OMIM: 615038

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known AA mutations or dbSNPs associated with CFAP57.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels or dbSNPs associated with CFAP57.

### Related Disease
- Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)
  - PCD is a rare genetic disorder affecting the motility of cilia, which can cause chronic respiratory infections, infertility, and other symptoms.
- Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)
  - CRS is a chronic inflammation of the sinuses that can be caused by various factors, including PCD.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for PCD or CRS, but symptoms can be managed through various treatments, such as antibiotics, bronchodilators, and nasal saline irrigations. The prognosis for these diseases varies among patients.

### Drug Response
Currently, there is no known drug response associated with CFAP57.
