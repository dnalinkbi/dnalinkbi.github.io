# Information about gene GFM2

## Genetic Position
Gene GFM2 is located on chromosome 5q13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in gene GFM2 have been associated with Leigh Syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive neurological degeneration, muscle weakness, and respiratory problems.

## Function for gene
The GFM2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in mitochondrial translation. Specifically, the protein plays a role in the elongation step of protein synthesis by promoting the translocation of tRNAs in the ribosome.
