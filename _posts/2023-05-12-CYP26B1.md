# Information about Gene CYP26B1

## Pathology

CYP26B1 is a gene that encodes cytochrome P450 26B1, which is involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid, an important signaling molecule in the pathway of cell growth and differentiation. Dysregulation of this gene has been associated with various types of cancer, such as breast and lung cancer. 

## Function

CYP26B1 is involved in the breakdown of excess vitamin A, controlling the level of retinoic acid (RA) in the body. RA has vital functions in embryonic development, cell differentiation, and maintaining healthy tissues. CYP26B1 facilitates the degradation of RA in an irreversible process, allowing effective control of RA availability and movement.

## Related Disease

Dysregulation of the CYP26B1 gene has been associated with various types of Cancer, such as Breast and Lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

As CYP26B1 is involved in cancer progression, it could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy. CYP26B1 inhibitors have been proposed, but there is not yet a treatment targeting the gene or protein directly.

## Drug Response

CYP26B1 inhibitors have been proposed for cancer treatment. However, further research is needed to better understand its role in cancer progression and to evaluate the efficacy of potential therapies.
