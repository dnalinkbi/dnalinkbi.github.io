# Information about gene ERBB3

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12q13.2

## Pathology
- ERBB3 is a proto-oncogene, meaning that it has the potential to cause cancer when mutated or overexpressed. It has been implicated in several types of cancer, including breast, gastric, and prostate cancer.

## Function for gene
- ERBB3 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell growth and differentiation. It is involved in the signaling pathway of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, and can activate downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK.

## Related disease
- ERBB3 has been associated with various cancers including breast cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
- ERBB3 is a potential target for cancer therapy. Drugs that target ERBB3 include monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. Prognosis for cancer patients with ERBB3 mutations depends on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug response
- ERBB3 can affect drug response in cancer patients. For example, ERBB3 overexpression has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic drugs.
