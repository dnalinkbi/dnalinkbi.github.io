# Gene LIPG

## General Information
- Gene: LIPG
- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 6683
    - NCBI Entrez: 9388
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000128652
    - OMIM: 603497
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5X9
- Genomic location: Chromosome 18: 20,938,706-20,959,974
- Aliases: EDL, EL, HLGL, LPG

## Function
The LIPG gene encodes the endothelial lipase, which is a member of the triglyceride lipase family. It plays a crucial role in the metabolism of lipoprotein particles and has been implicated in the regulation of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.

## Variations
- AA mutation list with type and dbSNP ID:
    - D207E (missense; rs3733089)
    - S307G (missense; rs61731956)
    - V409M (missense; rs2229741)
    - L440F (missense; rs6722801)
    
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - rs35941043 (SNV)
    - rs76613907 (SNV)
    
## Related Diseases
LIPG variants have been associated with several diseases including:
- Coronary artery disease
- Hyperlipidemia
- Atherosclerosis
- Type 2 diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
LIPG targeted therapies are currently being explored as a treatment option for hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Additionally, the use of LIPG inhibitors has shown promising results in increasing HDL levels. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of LIPG targeted therapies.

## Drug Response
LIPG inhibitors, such as darapladib, have shown potential in increasing HDL levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. However, the use of LIPG inhibitors is still in the experimental stage, and further studies are needed to determine their effectiveness.
