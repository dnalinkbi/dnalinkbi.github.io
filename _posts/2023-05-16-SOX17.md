# Information about gene SOX17

## Genetic Position
The SOX17 (SRY-box transcription factor 17) gene is located on chromosome 8p11.23 from base pair 37,637,977 to 37,645,943.

## Pathology and Function
SOX17 is an important transcription factor involved in the regulation of embryonic development and differentiation. It has been shown to play a critical role in several biological processes, including the development of endoderm and blood vessels, as well as maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. Mutations or dysregulation in SOX17 have been implicated in various diseases, including fetal growth restriction, congenital heart defects, and cancer.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported in the SOX17 gene, including:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| R248Q     | Missense     | rs150883236 |
| Q13R      | Missense     | rs139759239 |

| P90L      | Missense     | rs762803162 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) have been identified in the SOX17 gene. Some of the reported dbSNP IDs are:

- rs2278002
- rs145389598
- rs146703044
- rs12453677

## Related Disease
SOX17 mutations have been implicated in several diseases, including:

- Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
- Barrett esophagus

## Treatment and Prognosis
As SOX17 dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, understanding and targeting its function may have therapeutic implications. However, the treatment and prognosis would depend on the specific disease and the extent of SOX17 dysregulation.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug specifically targeting SOX17. However, various drugs targeting the downstream effects of SOX17 may exist depending on the specific disease.
