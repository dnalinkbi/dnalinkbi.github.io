# Information about gene PIK3R2

## Genetic position
The PIK3R2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.2 (19p13.2).

## Pathology
Mutations in the PIK3R2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, immune disorders, and developmental disorders. These mutations may lead to altered protein function and dysregulation of signaling pathways.

## Function for gene
The PIK3R2 gene encodes for the regulatory subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzyme. This subunit is involved in activation and regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell growth, metabolism, and survival.

## Related disease
Mutations in the PIK3R2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including:
- Breast cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Non-small cell lung cancer
- Primary immunodeficiency
- Developmental delay and intellectual disability

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with PIK3R2 mutations may vary based on the specific condition and mutation. Some potential treatment options may include targeted therapies that aim to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The prognosis may also depend on various factors, including disease stage, severity, and response to treatment.

## Drug response
PIK3R2 mutations have been shown to impact drug response in some cases. For example, mutations in this gene may lead to resistance to some targeted therapies that inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
