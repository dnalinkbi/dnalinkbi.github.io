# Information about Gene PRKRA

## Genetic Position
The human PRKRA gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q31.2.

## Pathology and Function
The PRKRA gene encodes a protein called protein activator of interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT). PACT is a double-stranded RNA binding protein that plays a crucial role in the antiviral response by activating the interferon-induced protein kinase R (PKR). PKR is involved in the inhibition of viral protein synthesis and the induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells.
