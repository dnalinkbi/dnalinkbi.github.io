# Gene LIM2 Information

## Genetic Position
LIM2 is located on human chromosome 19q13.31.

## Pathology 
Mutations in LIM2 have been associated with cataracts, an opacity or cloudiness of the lens in the eye.

## Function 
LIM2 encodes a protein that is a major component of the lens fiber cell. This protein is crucial for maintaining the transparency and integrity of the lens.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No significant somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the LIM2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in LIM2 have been associated with multiple types of cataracts, including congenital and age-related cataracts.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for cataracts involves surgical removal of the damaged lens and replacement with an artificial lens implant. Prognosis for individuals with cataracts is generally good, with success rates of cataract surgery being very high.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs targeting LIM2 gene specifically.
