## Gene: ATRNL1
### Genetic Position
ATRNL1 is located on chromosome 16q22.1

### Pathology
ATRNL1 has been implicated in several diseases and disorders, including cancers such as gastric cancer and breast cancer.

### Function
ATRNL1 encodes for the Attractin-like protein 1, which plays a role in cell adhesion and migration as well as in the regulation of cytokines and chemokines.
