## Gene REN

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 1 (1q32.2)

**Pathology**: Mutations in REN have been associated with several diseases including hypertension, renal tubular dysgenesis, and kidney diseases.

**Function**: The REN gene encodes renin, an enzyme responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and body fluids. It converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure.

- R41C (missense mutation) - rs1803269
- T173M (missense mutation) - rs2275913
- S158A (missense mutation) - rs1803268

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
- c.1213C>T (substitution) - rs1063192
- c.1461A>G (substitution) - rs1274392
- c.521C>T (substitution) - rs1274391

**Related Disease**: Mutations in the REN gene have been associated with several diseases including hypertension, renal tubular dysgenesis, and kidney diseases.

**Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for diseases related to REN mutations may involve the use of drugs that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Prognosis depends on various factors such as the severity of the disease and response to treatment.

**Drug Response**: Renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren, can be used to lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension.
