# Gene Information
## Gene Name
MESP2

## Function
The MESP2 gene is involved in the development of the cardiovascular system and the formation of the heart. It is responsible for the differentiation of mesodermal cells into cardiac cells during embryonic development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the MESP2 gene.

# Related Diseases
MESP2 mutations are associated with autosomal recessive congenital heart defects, including atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and other malformations of the heart and great vessels.

# Treatment and Prognosis
Management of congenital heart defects associated with MESP2 mutations typically involves surgical intervention, although the exact course of treatment depends on the specific nature and severity of the defects.

# Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with MESP2 mutations.
