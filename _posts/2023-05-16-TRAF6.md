# Gene TRAF6

## Information
- **Function**: TRAF6 gene encodes a protein that plays a key role in regulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways. It is involved in the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), a transcription factor that promotes the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and differentiation.
- **External IDs**: TRAF6 gene is located on chromosome 11 at position 11p12-p13. It has several aliases such as RNF85, MGC:3310, and LAP1.
