# Information about gene BIRC6

## Genetic Position
BIRC6 (Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 6) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33.3).

## Pathology
Mutations and altered expression of BIRC6 have been associated with several types of cancer including breast cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function for gene
BIRC6 encodes a protein called Apollon that has multiple functions including inhibition of apoptosis, regulation of cell cycle, and DNA damage repair.

## Related disease
Some of the diseases related to BIRC6 gene are:
- Breast cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Stomach cancer

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of individuals with mutations in BIRC6 depend on the type and stage of cancer. There are no specific treatments available for BIRC6 mutations, and the treatment plan varies depending on cancer type and stage.

## Drug response
There have been studies that suggest Apollon inhibitors such as SM-164 and Compound A may be effective for the treatment of certain types of cancer.
