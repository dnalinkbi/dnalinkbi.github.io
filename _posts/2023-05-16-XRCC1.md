# Information about gene XRCC1

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Genetic Position**: XRCC1 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2.
- **Pathology**: XRCC1 is involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and base excision repair. Mutations in XRCC1 have been associated with increased DNA damage and susceptibility to cancer.

## Function
- The XRCC1 gene encodes a protein called X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1, which plays a key role in DNA repair.
- It functions in the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, oxidative damage, and chemicals that modify DNA.

## External IDs
- **Gene ID**: 7515
- **Genomic Location**: NC_000019.10 (14400162..14467465)
- **Aliases**: RADC, RCC, RCC1, C3999 

## External Sites
- **HGNC**: 12853
- **NCBI Entrez**: 7515
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000128314
- **OMIM**: 194360
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P18887

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- A list of somatic SNVs/InDels with XRCC1 gene involvement and their dbSNP ID is provided below:

| SNV/InDel | dbSNP ID |
|------------|------------|
| c.875A>G   | rs3213296  |
| c.541-147T>C | rs3213309 |

## Related Disease
- Increased susceptibility to cancer has been associated with XRCC1 gene mutations. Various cancers such as breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer have been associated with XRCC1.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis for patients with XRCC1 mutations differs depending on the type of cancer and its stage. Consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended upon diagnosis.

## Drug Response
- Literature suggests that drugs such as methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug, may show reduced efficacy in XRCC1-deficient tumors. However, more research is needed to establish it as a reliable drug response predictor.
