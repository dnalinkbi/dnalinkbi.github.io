## Gene: CRYGD

### Function
The CRYGD (Crystallin, Gamma D) gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is part of the crystallin family. The protein is primarily found in the lens of the eye and is involved in maintaining transparency.

### Genetic Position
The CRYGD gene is located on chromosome 2 at 2q33-q35.

### Pathology
Mutations in the CRYGD gene have been linked with development of cataracts, which is a clouding of the eye's natural lens.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg37His - Missense mutation - rs28936668
- p.Ala2Val - Missense mutation - rs74315307

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported.

### Related Disease
CRYGD mutations are associated with congenital cataracts, which cause vision impairment present at birth or develop in childhood.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Surgery is the primary treatment for cataracts, which can effectively restore vision. Prognosis is generally good post-surgery, but the progression of cataracts can lead to vision impairment again over time.

### Drug Response
None reported.
