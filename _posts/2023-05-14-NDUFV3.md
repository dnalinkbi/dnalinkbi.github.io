# Information on Gene NDUFV3

## Genetic Position

NDUFV3 is located on chromosome 11 (11q13.2) and contains 7 exons.

## Pathology

Pathogenic mutations in NDUFV3 have been found to cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a rare disorder that affects the function of cellular respiration and can lead to a range of symptoms.

## Function

NDUFV3 encodes a subunit of complex I, which is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The protein is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain.
