## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for SLC4A4.

## Related Disease

SLC4A4 mutations are associated with Proximal Renal Tubular Acidosis (pRTA) and Hearing Loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for pRTA typically involves the use of alkali supplements to correct the acid-base balance in the body. Hearing loss can also be treated through hearing aids and cochlear implants. The prognosis for patients with SLC4A4 mutations varies depending on the severity of the associated symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response to SLC4A4 mutations.
