## Related Diseases

- **Disease name:** Mitochondrial complex I deficiency
- **Inheritance pattern:** This disease can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, or can occur spontaneously (de novo).

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency, and treatment typically focuses on managing symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
