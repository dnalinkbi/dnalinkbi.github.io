### Information about Gene SDHAF2
SDHAF2, also known as succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2, is a gene that plays a key role in mitochondrial metabolism. It is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q13.1, and it consists of five exons.

### Function for Gene
The function of SDHAF2 gene is to encode a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex. The SDH complex is an integral membrane protein complex found in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It plays a crucial role in the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, which are essential processes in cellular respiration and energy production. The SDHAF2 protein is essential for incorporating flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) into the SDH complex, which is a crucial step in the SDH complex's assembly.

### Related Disease
Germline mutations in SDHAF2 have been associated with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytomas, a rare type of inherited cancer that affects the peripheral nervous system.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytomas are typically treated with surgical resection of the tumor. Patients with SDHAF2 mutations may have a higher risk of developing multiple or recurrent tumors and may require long-term surveillance.

### Drug Response
There is no information currently available on the drug response of SDHAF2 mutations.
