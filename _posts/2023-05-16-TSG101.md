## Gene: TSG101 (Tumor susceptibility gene 101)

### Pathology
TSG101 is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 11p15.5. Mutations in this gene are associated with several types of cancer, including breast and prostate cancer. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of many cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking, cytokinesis, and viral budding.

### Function
TSG101 is involved in the formation of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), which is responsible for sorting transmembrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and ultimately degrading them in lysosomes. Additionally, TSG101 plays a role in cytokinesis, where it is involved in the abscission of the cytokinetic bridge that connects two daughter cells at the final stages of cell division.
