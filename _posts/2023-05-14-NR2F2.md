## Gene: NR2F2

### Genetic Position:
NR2F2 is located on the long arm of Chromosome 15 at position 15q26.1.

### Pathology:
Mutations in the NR2F2 gene have been implicated in congenital heart disease and atrial fibrillation. In addition, it has been suggested that NR2F2 may play a role in prostate cancer.

### Function for Gene:
NR2F2 is a nuclear receptor which function as a transcription factor that regulates the development of many organs, including the heart, lungs, brain, and kidneys. Additionally, it has been suggested that NR2F2 may play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.
