## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** SDHB

**Function for gene:** SDHB gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme complex that plays a key role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is involved in the oxidation of succinate to fumarate.

**Related Disease:** 
- Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome
- Renal cell carcinoma
- Gastrointestinal stromal tumor

**Treatment and prognosis:** 
- The treatment of SDHB-related tumors is based on surgical removal to halt the spread of the disease. 
- Patients with SDHB-related tumors need to be monitored regularly to catch any recurrence of tumors
- The prognosis for patients with SDHB-related tumors depends on factors like tumor stage, location, and grade

**Drug response:** The response to chemotherapy varies among individual patients.
