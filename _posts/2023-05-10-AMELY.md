## Gene AMELY

### Information about Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- Genetic Position: The AMELY gene is located on the Y chromosome at position Yp11.2.
- Pathology: Mutations in the AMELY gene have been associated with sex reversal and male infertility.
- Function: The AMELY gene encodes for the male-specific protein, amelogenin Y, which is involved in tooth enamel formation and has also been proposed to have a role in sperm development.

### Additional Information

- Function: Amelogenin Y is involved in the formation of tooth enamel and is also expressed in a subset of testicular germ cells.
- External IDs: HGNC: 492, NCBI Entrez: 266, Ensembl: ENSG00000169014, OMIM: 400005, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23327
- Aliases: SPGY, AMGN, AMEY, dJ710F5.1
- AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID: 
    - c.34G>C (p.Gly12Ala) - rs7141523
    - c.261C>T (p.Arg87Trp) - rs7141525
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Not applicable as the AMELY is located on the Y chromosome and is therefore not present in females.
- Related Disease: Male infertility, sex reversal disorders
- Treatment and Prognosis: Treatment options for male infertility depend on the underlying cause of infertility and may include lifestyle changes, fertility medications or assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).
- Drug Response: Not applicable as there are no known drugs that target the AMELY gene.
