# Information about gene SEMA3A

## Genetic Position and Info
- SEMA3A is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21.11)
- Its genomic location is 7:87,547,582-87,662,151
- aliases: SEMA3, SEMAD, SEMAJ5, coll-III, and semaIII

## Function 
The SEMA3A (semaphorin 3A) gene encodes a protein involved in nervous system development. This protein regulates axon guidance, cell migration, and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) in various tissues.

## Related Disease
- SEMA3A gene mutations are associated with certain neurological conditions, including Kallmann syndrome, which affects puberty and sense of smell, and congenital or idiopathic central hypoventilation syndrome, which affects breathing control. 
- Additionally, SEMA3A has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for the neurological conditions associated with SEMA3A gene mutations varies based on the specific condition and symptoms. 
- In cancer, targeting SEMA3A has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis.

## Drug Response
- Various studies have suggested that drugs targeting the SEMA3A axis may be effective in inhibiting angiogenesis in cancer.
