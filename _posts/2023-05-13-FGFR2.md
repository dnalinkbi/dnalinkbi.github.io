# Gene FGFR2

## Genetic Position and Pathology
   - Gene symbol: FGFR2 
   - Chromosome: 10
   - Location: 10q26.13
   - Pathology: Mutations/misregulation in FGFR2 gene have been linked to various diseases including craniosynostosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and some types of cancer.

## Function for gene
   - FGFR2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. It plays a crucial role in cell differentiation, growth, and development. The protein functions as a receptor for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and promotes signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and angiogenesis.

## Related Diseases
   - Craniosynostosis 
   - Pfeiffer syndrome
   - Crouzon syndrome
   - Endometrial cancer
   - Breast cancer
   - Gastric cancer
   - Ovarian cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
   - Treatment and prognosis for the diseases caused by FGFR2 gene mutations depend on the specific condition and the severity of the symptoms.
   - There are multiple clinical trials ongoing testing drugs that target FGFR2 protein in cancer patients.

## Drug Response
   - The response to drugs targeting FGFR2 protein varies depending on the nature of the drug and the specific indication. 
   - Dovitinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has been found to be effective in some FGFR2-positive malignancies.
   - Other drugs targeting FGFR2 are in preclinical or clinical trials.
