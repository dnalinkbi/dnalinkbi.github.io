## Gene SLC23A2
**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 20q13.2

**Pathology:** No pathological association was found for this gene yet.

**Function:** This gene encodes a vitamin C transporter that regulates the absorption and distribution of vitamin C in the body. It belongs to the SLC23 family of transporters and is primarily expressed in the intestine, liver, and kidney.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 10951
- NCBI Entrez: 9965
- Ensembl: ENSG00000101279
- OMIM: 603736
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UHK6

**Aliases:** SVCT2, UCP, UCPH

**AA Mutation List:**

|Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|-------------|--------|
|p.Gly82Arg|Missense|rs41301848|
|p.Ala388Thr|Missense|rs3738816|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

No known somatic mutations were found in this gene.

**Related Disease:**

Mutations in SLC23A2 have been associated with:
- Scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency
- Gastrointestinal dysfunction

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Treatment for scurvy mainly involves administering vitamin C supplements. The prognosis for scurvy is excellent with adequate treatment.

**Drug Response:**

Vitamin C supplements can effectively treat scurvy caused by SLC23A2 mutations.
