# Information about gene ATPAF2

## Genetic Position

The gene **ATAF2** is located on chromosome 18 at position 18q21.31.

## Pathology and Function

The ATPAF2 gene encodes for a protein called ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 2. This protein is involved in the assembly and regulation of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase (ATP synthase) complex, which plays an important role in oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Mutations in the ATPAF2 gene have been associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and colorectal cancer.
