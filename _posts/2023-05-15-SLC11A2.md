# Gene: SLC11A2

## Genetic Position
SLC11A2 gene is located on chromosome 12q13.3.

## Pathology
SLC11A2 mutations have been associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and salmonellosis. Mutations in this gene have also been linked to iron metabolism disorders such as hemochromatosis.

## Function
The SLC11A2 gene encodes the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) that plays a crucial role in the absorption of iron, and other divalent metals across the intestinal mucosa.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations for SLC11A2 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
- Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA)
- Hemochromatosis, Type 4
- Tuberculosis susceptibility
- Leprosy susceptibility

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of the iron metabolism disorders caused by SLC11A2 mutations involves iron chelation therapy, while the infectious diseases require appropriate antimicrobial agents.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with genetic variations in SLC11A2.
