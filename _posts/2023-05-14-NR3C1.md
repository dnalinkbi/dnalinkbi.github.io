# Gene: NR3C1

- **Function:** NR3C1 encodes for the glucocorticoid receptor, which is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates gene expression in response to cortisol, a hormone involved in stress response. NR3C1 also plays a key role in many physiological processes including immune function, glucose metabolism, and cell differentiation.

- **Related Disease:** NR3C1 mutations have been associated with a variety of diseases, including:

  - Major depressive disorder
  - Bipolar disorder
  - Post-traumatic stress disorder
  - Asthma
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** For NR3C1-associated diseases, targeted treatments such as glucocorticoid therapy and psychotherapy have been shown to be effective. Prognosis can vary depending on the specific disease and individual patient factors.

- **Drug Response:** NR3C1 mutations can affect drug response to glucocorticoid therapy in diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
