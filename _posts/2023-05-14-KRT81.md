## Information about Gene KRT81

### Genetic Position
- The KRT81 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 12 at position 13.13.

### Pathology and Function for Gene
- The KRT81 gene encodes for the protein Keratin 81, which is a member of the type II keratin family. These keratins are found in the hair follicles and cuticle of the hair, where they provide strength and structure to the hair shaft. 
- Variations in the KRT81 gene have been associated with various human hair disorders, including monilethrix and alopecia.
