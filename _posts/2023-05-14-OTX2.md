# Gene OTX2

## Genetic Position
Gene OTX2 is located on the chromosome 14 at the position 32.12 (14q22.3).

## Pathology
There are several mutations identified in the OTX2 gene that are associated with different pathologies such as microphthalmia with coloboma, pituitary adenomas, and brain tumors.

## Function
OTX2 gene belongs to a family of bicoid-related transcription factors that play an important role in embryonic development. OTX2 gene is involved in the development of many organs such as the brain, eyes, ears, and pituitary gland. Additionally, the gene is important for the maintenance of stem cells in the adult organism.
