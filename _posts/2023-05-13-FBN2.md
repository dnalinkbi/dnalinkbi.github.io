## Gene FBN2 

### Genomic position
The FBN2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q23.3). This position refers to its genomic location.

### Pathology and Function
The FBN2 gene encodes for the protein fibrillin-2, which is a component of microfibrils in connective tissue. Mutations in the FBN2 gene are associated with a range of connective tissue disorders, including congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), which is also known as Beals syndrome. 

### Gene External IDs and Aliases
HGNC ID: 3604  
Ensembl ID: ENSG00000165298  
NCBI Entrez ID: 2201  
OMIM ID: 121050  
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P35555  
Aliases: CCA, MFS2  

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some reported missense variants in FBN2 that have implications in CCA or MFS2 include:  
- p.Cys1396Tyr (rs767144283)
- p.Arg1636Trp (rs121912740)
- p.Arg1183Trp (rs267606930)
- p.Glu1287Lys (rs398122951) 

All these variants result in substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic variants for FBN2.

### Related Diseases
FBN2 mutations are primarily associated with congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by elongated limbs, contractures of the fingers and toes, and a characteristic facial appearance. Mutations in FBN2 have also been associated with Marfan syndrome type II (MFS2).

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CCA, and treatment is largely symptomatic, involving interventions such as physiotherapy to maintain joint mobility, and surgical correction of dislocated joints or scoliosis. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms. Those with mild CCA can have a normal lifespan, while those with severe cases may experience significant morbidity and mortality.

### Drug Response
There are no known drugs that directly target FBN2 or CCA. Treatment is generally supportive and aims to manage symptoms.
