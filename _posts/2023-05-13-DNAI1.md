# Information about gene DNAI1

## Introduction
DNAI1 gene is located on chromosome 9 and encodes for an axonemal dynein intermediate chain protein. It has a significant role in the function of cilia which are hair-like structures present in the respiratory tract, fallopian tubes, and brain ventricles.

## Function
The DNAI1 gene provides instructions for the synthesis of a protein that is a member of dynein motor complex, which consists of several proteins responsible for the movement of cilia and flagella. The protein encoded by DNAI1 gene is crucial for the structural organization and motility of cilia.

## Related disease
Defects in DNAI1 gene lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia-19 (CILD19), a rare disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, situs inversus (right to left reversal of organs), and infertility due to immotile cilia in the respiratory and fallopian tubes.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for primary ciliary dyskinesia-19, and treatment is largely supportive and management of symptoms. Patients with properly diagnosed CILD19 can expect to live an average life span.

## Drug response
Currently, there is no specific drug for treating CILD19.
