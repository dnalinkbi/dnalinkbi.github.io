# Information about gene FGF3

### Genetic Position
FGF3 is located on chromosome 11 in humans, and its genomic coordinates are 76,690,935 to 76,704,373.

### Pathology
FGF3 has been implicated in several cancers, including breast and lung cancer. In breast cancer, overexpression of FGF3 has been associated with increased tumor growth and resistance to therapy. In lung cancer, FGF3 is frequently amplified in squamous cell carcinoma and has been shown to promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

### Function for gene
FGF3 encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of proteins. These proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. FGF3 specifically promotes the proliferation of epithelial cells and has been implicated in the development of several organs, including the inner ear and the mammary gland.

### Related Disease
Several diseases have been associated with mutations or dysregulation of FGF3, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and inner ear disorders such as vestibular schwannoma and Mondini dysplasia.

### Treatment and Prognosis 
Currently, there are no targeted treatments for FGF3-related cancers. However, the overexpression of FGF3 in breast cancer has been linked to a poorer prognosis, and targeting FGF3 may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the future.

### Drug Response
There is no data available on drug response specific to FGF3.
