# Information about Gene CYP2J2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 1p34.3
- **Pathology**: CYP2J2 has been linked to several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and stroke, due to its involvement in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs).
- **Function for Gene**: CYP2J2 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of drugs and endogenous substrates. It specifically catalyzes the epoxidation of arachidonic acid to form EETs, which play a role in the regulation of blood pressure and inflammation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several known non-synonymous mutations in CYP2J2 that have been reported in various populations, including:
    - R75Q (dbSNP ID: rs890293)
    - P316A (dbSNP ID: rs11572103)
    - N568T (dbSNP ID: rs890293)
- These mutations are missense mutations that result in amino acid changes in the CYP2J2 protein.


## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs and InDels reported in CYP2J2 in various cancers, including:
    - c.835G>A (dbSNP ID: rs137854415)
    - c.1012C>T (dbSNP ID: rs778392806)
- These mutations are thought to potentially affect the metabolism of EETs and may contribute to cancer development or progression.


## Related Disease
- CYP2J2 has been linked to several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and stroke, due to its involvement in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and EETs.


## Treatment and Prognosis
- There are currently no approved treatments specifically targeting CYP2J2, but there is ongoing research into the potential therapeutic use of EETs. 
- The prognosis for cardiovascular diseases linked to CYP2J2 may vary depending on the severity of the disease and other contributing factors.


## Drug Response
- CYP2J2 is involved in the metabolism of several drugs, including terfenadine and astemizole. 
- Patients with genetic variations in CYP2J2 may exhibit altered drug metabolism, leading to potential differences in drug efficacy or toxicity.
