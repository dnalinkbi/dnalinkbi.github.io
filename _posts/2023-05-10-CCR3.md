# Gene CCR3

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 3: 46,553,794-46,558,314
- **Function:** The CCR3 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to the chemokine eotaxin and plays a role in eosinophil recruitment to inflammatory sites.
- **Aliases:** CKR3, CC-CKR-3, CD193, MGC102832

## External IDs

- **HGNC:** HGNC:1609
- **NCBI Entrez:** 1232
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000163877
- **OMIM:** 601268
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P51677

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List:** c.295C>T (p.Ala99Val), c.709G>A (p.Glu237Lys), c.724C>A (p.Leu242Ile), c.794C>A (p.Thr265Asn)
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs928413, rs1799862, rs1800667, rs2304672

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for the CCR3 gene.

## Related Diseases

- **Allergic Rhinitis:** An inflammatory disorder of the nasal mucosa, typically characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching. The CCR3 gene has been associated with susceptibility to this disease.
- **Asthma:** A chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and variable airflow limitation. Various studies have suggested that polymorphisms in the CCR3 gene may contribute to asthma susceptibility and severity.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for allergic rhinitis and asthma may include antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and immunotherapy. Prognosis for these conditions varies depending on disease severity and response to treatment.

## Drug Response

- Various studies have suggested that antagonists of the CCR3 receptor may be useful in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma.
