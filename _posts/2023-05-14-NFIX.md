# Gene Information for NFIX

## Genomic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Location: q13.32

## Function
The NFIX gene encodes a member of the nuclear factor I (NFI) family of transcription factors. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression and plays a critical role in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and development.
