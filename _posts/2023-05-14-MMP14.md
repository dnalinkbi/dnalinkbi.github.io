# Gene: MMP14

**Function:** MMP14 (Matrix metalloproteinase-14) is a membrane-bound protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling. It is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as angiogenesis, cell migration, and invasion.

- c.509C>T, p.Pro170Ser, rs202092501

**Related Disease:** MMP14 has been implicated in a variety of diseases including cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Several small molecule inhibitors targeting MMP14 are currently under development for cancer therapy. Inhibiting MMP14 has been shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical models.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no information available on the drug response of MMP14.
