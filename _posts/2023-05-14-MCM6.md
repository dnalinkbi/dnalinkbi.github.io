# Information about Gene MCM6

## Genetic Position
Gene MCM6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q21.3).

## Pathology and Function
This gene encodes a protein that plays an essential role in DNA replication by facilitating the unwinding of double-stranded DNA. MCM6 has also been associated with lactose tolerance, as it is located adjacent to the lactase gene (LCT) and is involved in the production of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg419Cys (rs4988235)
- p.Arg601Ter (rs4988236)

Mutation Types: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported for gene MCM6.

## Related Disease
Mutations in MCM6 are associated with lactose intolerance.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Lactose intolerance can be managed through dietary modifications, such as avoiding lactose-containing foods or taking lactase supplements.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs that directly target MCM6.
