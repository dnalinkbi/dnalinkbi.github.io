# Gene IRS4

## Gene Position

- **Chromosome:** 2
- **Genetic Position:** 232.37 - 235.08 Mb

## Pathology

Gene IRS4 is associated with several diseases, including breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. 

## Function

The IRS4 gene encodes for insulin receptor substrate 4, which is involved in the insulin signaling pathway. The IRS4 protein helps to transmit signals from the insulin receptor to downstream signaling molecules. This signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating glucose metabolism.

## Related Diseases

- Breast cancer
- Alzheimer's disease
- Type 2 diabetes

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for IRS4 gene mutations. Treatment for related diseases may involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other standard treatment options.

Prognosis depends on the specific disease being treated and the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis.

## Drug Response

There is limited data on drug response for individuals with IRS4 gene mutations.
