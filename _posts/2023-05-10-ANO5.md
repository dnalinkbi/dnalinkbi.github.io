## Gene ANO5

### Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11: 65,066,333-65,190,636
- **Pathology:** Mutations in ANO5 have been associated with several muscle diseases, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L (LGMD2L) and Miyoshi muscular dystrophy type 3 (MMD3).
- **Function:** ANO5 is a member of the anoctamin protein family, which are calcium-activated chloride channels. ANO5 has been suggested to play a role in membrane fusion and repair in muscle cells.

### Related Diseases
- Mutations in ANO5 have been associated with many muscle diseases, including:
    * Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2L (LGMD2L)
    * Miyoshi Muscular Dystrophy Type 3 (MMD3)
    * Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles (DMRV)
    * Inclusion Body Myopathy 2, Autosomal Recessive (IBM2)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for ANO5-related muscle diseases. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Physical therapy, mobility aids, and respiratory support may be necessary. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and its severity.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug therapy for ANO5-related muscle diseases. However, research is ongoing and drug development is a potential avenue for the future.
