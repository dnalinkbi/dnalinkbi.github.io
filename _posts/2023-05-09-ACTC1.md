# Information on Gene ACTC1

## Genetic Position and Pathology

The ACTC1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position q14. This gene encodes for the alpha cardiac actin protein, which is involved in the contraction of the heart muscle. Mutations in the ACTC1 gene have been associated with various cardiac pathologies, including cardiomyopathy, congenital heart diseases, and atrial septal defects.

## Function

The alpha cardiac actin protein, encoded by the ACTC1 gene, is a structural protein that makes up the thin filaments in the heart muscle. The protein plays a crucial role in the contraction and relaxation of the cardiac muscle.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the ACTC1 gene have been associated with several cardiac diseases, including:

- Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy
- Atrial Septal Defect
- Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis of cardiac diseases associated with ACTC1 gene mutations depend on the severity and type of the disease. Treatment options may include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgery in some cases.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response related to ACTC1 gene mutations.
