# Gene: PCSK5

## Information 
- Pathology: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the processing of peptide hormones and neuropeptides, including proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin. 
- Function: PCSK5 plays a pivotal role in the endocrine system and regulation of glucose homeostasis, obesity and pancreatic development.
