## Gene: RAG1

### Information about gene RAG1
- **Genetic Position**: Located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p12-p13) 
- **Pathology**: Mutations in RAG1 are known to cause various types of primary immunodeficiency disorders, such as Omenn syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with variable clinical presentations. 
- **Function**: The RAG1 gene encodes the Recombination-Activating Gene 1 protein, which is involved in V(D)J recombination and plays an important role in the development of immune cells.

### Related Disease
- Omenn Syndrome
- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be an effective treatment for RAG1 deficiency.
- Overall prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease, but early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes.

### Drug Response
- There is no specific drug available to treat RAG1 deficiency, but antibiotics, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, and IVIG therapy can help manage symptoms.
