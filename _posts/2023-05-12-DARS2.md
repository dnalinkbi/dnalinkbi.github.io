# Gene Information for DARS2

## Position
DARS2 is located on chromosome 1 at position q42.13.

## Pathology
DARS2 has been linked to various conditions including leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL), mitochondrial myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and more.

## Function
DARS2 encodes for mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme responsible for charging tRNA molecules with aspartic acid during protein translation.
