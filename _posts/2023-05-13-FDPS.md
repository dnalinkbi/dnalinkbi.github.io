# Gene: FDPS

## Genetic Position
The FDPS gene is located on chromosome 1q23.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FDPS gene are associated with a variety of disorders, such as hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome and mevalonic aciduria.

## Function
The FDPS gene encodes an enzyme called farnesyl diphosphate synthase. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are essential for a variety of cellular processes such as protein prenylation and membrane structure.
