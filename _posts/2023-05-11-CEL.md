## Gene: CEL
### Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 9
- Start position: 34,791,732 bp
- End position: 34,827,594 bp

### Function
The CEL gene codes for the pancreatic cholesterol esterase, which plays a role in the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters and triglycerides. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 1789
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 1065
- Ensembl: ENSG00000065427
- OMIM: 114820
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P19835
- Other Aliases: BFE, CE, CHO-TL, ESTL, GDX, HEL4, PCE

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported for the CEL gene, including:
- p.Arg15His (rs28929474)
- p.Val69Leu (rs121909516)
- p.Arg184Gly (rs138213970)
- p.Gln324Ter (rs121909517)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations for the CEL gene in dbSNP.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in the CEL gene have been associated with pancreatic lipase deficiency, which can lead to malabsorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
Pancreatic lipase deficiency can be treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which can improve symptoms and nutritional status. Prognosis depends on the severity of the deficiency and any associated complications.

### Drug Response
There is no reported information for drug response related to the CEL gene.
