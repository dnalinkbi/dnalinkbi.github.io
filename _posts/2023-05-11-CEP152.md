## Gene CEP152

### Genetic Position
- CEP152 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at the position 15q21.1.

### Pathology
- Mutations in the CEP152 gene have been linked to a variety of disorders characterized by abnormal cellular division or genome instability, including Microcephaly, Primary autosomal recessive, 9 (MCPH9) and Seckel Syndrome.
- Loss of function mutations in this gene lead to abnormal spindle formation during mitosis, leading to cell division defects and ultimately microcephaly.

### Function
- CEP152 encodes a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell division. 
- It is essential for the recruitment and localization of other centrosomal proteins, and also acts as a scaffold for regulatory proteins. 
- It is involved in microtubule nucleation, and contributes to the formation of the spindle during mitosis.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- Several missense and frameshift mutations have been identified in CEP152, including:
    - c.79C>T (p.Gln27Ter) - rs761770685
    - c.464A>C (p.Asn155Thr) - rs757764063
    - c.596A>G (p.Arg199Gly) - rs145086273
    - c.3124C>T (p.Arg1042Ter) - rs782596163
- These mutations have been reported to be associated with microcephaly and other developmental disorders.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic mutations in CEP152 are currently listed in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
- Mutations in CEP152 are associated with microcephaly, a condition characterized by a reduced head circumference and developmental delay.
- Seckel Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, and other abnormalities, has been linked to defects in the CEP152 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no specific treatment or cure for microcephaly or Seckel Syndrome. Treatment is typically supportive, with a focus on managing symptoms and providing appropriate developmental interventions.
- Prognosis can vary widely depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of other associated abnormalities.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug specifically targeted to treat microcephaly or Seckel Syndrome.
