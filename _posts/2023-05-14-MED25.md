### Gene MED25

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 19q13.33

**Aliases**: ARC92, CRSP7, DRIP92, PTOV1, TRAP95

**Function of Gene**: MED25, also known as ARC92, is an essential component of the Mediator complex which acts as a transcriptional coactivator for RNA polymerase II-mediated gene transcription. MED25 is involved in multiple signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in the regulation of metabolic and developmental processes, cellular differentiation, and immune responses.

**Related Disease**: MED25 mutations have been linked to various diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer. Aberrant expression of MED25 has also been associated with prostate cancer, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no specific treatment available for MED25-associated diseases. The prognosis for patients with MED25 mutations varies depending on the type and severity of the disease.

**Drug Response**: There is limited information available regarding drug response for MED25 mutations.
