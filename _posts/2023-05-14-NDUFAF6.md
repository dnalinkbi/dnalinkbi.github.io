# Gene Information
**Gene name:** NDUFAF6

**Genetic position:** Chromosome Xq22.1

**Aliases:** COXPD14, NDUFAF5P2, FAM36A

## Function for Gene
The NDUFAF6 gene encodes a protein that is an assembly factor for mitochondrial Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which is a multi-subunit enzyme complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation. It is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters that are essential for the activity of Complex I.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the NDUFAF6 gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a genetic condition that affects the function of complex I and leads to a variety of symptoms, including muscle weakness, developmental delay, seizures, and respiratory problems.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and complications associated with the condition. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the symptoms and the specific genetic mutation involved.

## Drug Response

There is currently no specific drug treatment available for mitochondrial complex I deficiency. However, some medications and supplements may be used to manage the symptoms and support mitochondrial function.
