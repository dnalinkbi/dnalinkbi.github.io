# Information about gene CDK4

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- CDK4 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 12 at position 14.1.
- It plays a key role in the regulation of cell division, particularly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
- CDK4 forms a complex with Cyclin D and phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), leading to the release of transcription factor E2F and upregulation of genes necessary for progression through the cell cycle.

## Gene function
CDK4 gene is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, making it a crucial gene for normal cellular processes.
