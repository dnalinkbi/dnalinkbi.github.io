# Gene: CHRNB4 

## Genetic Position 

The CHRNB4 (cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 4 subunit) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 at position 13.3. 

## Pathology 

The CHRNB4 gene is associated with both nicotine addiction and lung cancer risk. 

## Function 

The CHRNB4 gene encodes a subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and are responsible for mediating the effects of acetylcholine and nicotine. The beta-4 subunit has been shown to play a role in nicotine addiction and withdrawal.

## AA Mutation List 

|Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|---------|------|----------|
|p.V295M  | Missense | rs2273507 |
|p.P461L  | Missense | rs1044396 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels 

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels identified in the CHRNB4 gene in lung cancer: 

| Mutation | dbSNP ID |
|----------|----------|
| c.344C>T | rs143550767 |
| c.382G>T | rs147102710 |
| c.571A>G | rs753955888 |

## Related Disease 

- Nicotine addiction 
- Lung cancer 

## Treatment and Prognosis 

There are currently no targeted treatments for lung cancer or nicotine addiction based on CHRNB4 mutations alone. Treatment and prognosis are determined based on other factors such as the stage and type of cancer, as well as the individual's overall health and likelihood of quitting smoking. 

## Drug Response 

Certain variations in the CHRNB4 gene have been associated with an increased risk of nicotine addiction and decreased success rate in smoking cessation programs.
