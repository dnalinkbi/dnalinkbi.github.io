# Gene: DSP

## Information
- Function: The DSP gene encodes a protein called Desmoplakin, which is crucial in maintaining cell-to-cell adhesion in tissues like skin and heart muscle. 
- External IDs: 
    - Gene: 1832
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 6q24.3
    - Aliases: DPI, PPKS, DP1
- External Sites:
    - HGNC: 3051
    - NCBI Entrez: 1832
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000188976
    - OMIM: 125647
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P15924

## Mutations
- AA mutation list:
    - p.Arg2835Ter
    - p.Gly2373CysfsTer5
- Mutation type: Frameshift
- dbSNP ID: rs864309141, rs863224243

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: rs146009903, rs146778513, rs766740317

## Related Disease
- Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: Management of ARVC symptoms, including heart failure and arrhythmias. 
- Prognosis: Patients can experience sudden cardiac death, so early diagnosis and treatment is crucial.

## Drug Response
- DSP mutations have been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin.
