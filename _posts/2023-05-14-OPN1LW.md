# Gene: OPN1LW

## Genetic Position
The OPN1LW gene is located on the X-chromosome at Xq28. This gene extends approximately 16 kilobases and contains 6 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in the OPN1LW gene are associated with red-green color vision deficiencies. These mutations can cause various types of color vision deficiencies, including protanopia and deuteranopia.

## Function
The OPN1LW gene encodes a photopigment, also known as long-wavelength-sensitive opsin or red cone opsin. This photopigment is located in the cone cells of the retina and is responsible for color vision perception.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the OPN1LW gene.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in OPN1LW gene are associated with red-green color vision deficiencies, a type of color blindness.
