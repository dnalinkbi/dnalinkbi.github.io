# Gene APOE

## Genetic Position
APOE is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.2).
 
## Pathology
APOE gene is associated with multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia. 

## Function
APOE gene encodes apolipoprotein E which plays a vital role in lipid metabolism, cholesterol transport, and synaptic plasticity.  

## External IDs and Aliases

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- R176C (Missense) - rs769446
- R158C (Missense) - rs429358
- R61T (Missense) - rs429358, rs769446
- Cys112Arg (Missense) - rs429358 
- Cys158Arg (Missense) - rs7412

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for APOE gene.

## Related Disease
- Alzheimer's disease
- Cardiovascular disease
- Hyperlipidemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
Various pharmaceutical drugs such as statins and dietary modifications are utilized for the treatment of hyperlipidemia caused by APOE gene mutations. However, there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease associated with APOE gene mutations.

## Drug Response
Individuals with APOE ùúÄ4/ùúÄ4 genotype have been reported to respond better to a specific medication named galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
