# Analysis of Gene FUT7 Information

## Gene Information

- Gene Name: FUT7
- External IDs: HGNC:4029, NCBI Entrez:2524, Ensembl:ENSG00000110610, OMIM:129150, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P51993
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 9, 9q34.3
- Aliases: FucT-VII, ALPHA-3-fucosyltransferase, Fuc-TVII, Fucosyltransferase 7, L-selectin ligand synthase

## Function 

The FUT7 gene encodes the enzyme Alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase 7, which is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of fucose from GDP-fucose to a terminal Galbeta1-4GlcNAc or Galbeta1-3GlcNAc group on glycoproteins and glycolipids.

## Mutations 

- AA mutation list: A list of amino acid mutations for the FUT7 gene is not currently available.
- Mutation type: No specific mutation type is currently reported for this gene.
- dbSNP ID: No dbSNP IDs are currently reported for FUT7 mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- dbSNP ID: No dbSNP IDs are currently reported for somatic SNVs/InDels for FUT7.

## Related Disease

Deficiencies in FUT7 have been linked to differential fucosylation of selectin ligands, a key mechanism in the immune response. This deficiency has been linked to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for FUT7 deficiency. Prognosis will vary based on the severity of the deficiency and the related disease.

## Drug Response

Due to the lack of information on specific mutations and diseases related to FUT7, there is currently no reported drug response.
