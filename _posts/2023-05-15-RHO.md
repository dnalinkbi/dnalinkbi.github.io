# Gene: RHO

## Information
- **Pathology:** RHO is a gene that encodes a protein called rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is a light-sensitive protein that plays a crucial role in vision. Mutations in RHO have been linked to various types of retinal degeneration and vision loss, including retinitis pigmentosa, congenital stationary night blindness, and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
- **Function:** Rhodopsin is a G protein-coupled receptor that absorbs light and activates a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to visual perception. Rhodopsin is particularly important in the rods of the retina, which are responsible for vision in low-light conditions.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**
    - Treatment options for retinal degeneration caused by RHO mutations are limited and largely palliative. Options include vision aids and low-vision aids. Gene therapy and other emerging treatments show promise but are still in development. Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and individual patient factors.
- **Drug response:**
    - There is currently no specific drug treatment for RHO-related retinal degeneration, but some drugs may help manage symptoms.
