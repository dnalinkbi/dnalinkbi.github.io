# Information about gene MYBPC3

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

- Genetic Position: The gene MYBPC3 is located on the chromosome 11 at the position 11p11.2.
- Pathology: Mutations in MYBPC3 gene lead to Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1I (CMD1I) which is a heart disease characterized by dilated left and/or right ventricles and reduced systolic function.
- Function: MYBPC3 is responsible for encoding the cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) which is important for the contraction of the heart muscle.

## Related Disease 

- Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1I (CMD1I)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, there is no known cure for CMD1I. Treatment mainly aims at managing the symptoms and complications associated with the disease. 
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age at which symptoms first appear. 

## Drug Response 

- There is limited information about the drug response for MYBPC3 related cardiomyopathy.
