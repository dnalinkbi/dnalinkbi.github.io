# Information about Gene ADH1B

## Genetic Position
The ADH1B gene is located on Chromosome 4, position 4q23.

## Pathology and Function
The ADH1B gene encodes for alcohol dehydrogenase 1B, an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of alcohol. The ADH1B enzyme is primarily found in the liver and is responsible for converting alcohol into acetaldehyde. The acetaldehyde is then further metabolized into acetate by another enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). 

Several studies have found a significant association between ADH1B variants and reduced risk for alcoholism. One of the most well-known variants is rs1229984, which results in an amino acid substitution of histidine for arginine at position 48 (Arg48His). This variant has been shown to result in higher enzyme activity and faster alcohol metabolism, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde and unpleasant symptoms such as facial flushing, nausea, and headaches after consuming alcohol.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in ADH1B.

## Related Disease
Variants in ADH1B have been associated with alcohol sensitivity and reduced risk for alcoholism.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for ADH1B variants. Prognosis varies based on individual drinking habits and lifestyle factors.

## Drug Response
Variants in ADH1B can affect an individual's response to alcohol, but do not typically affect response to other drugs.
