# Gene: BHLHA9

**Function:** The BHLHA9 gene is associated with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family transcription factors. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression that controls various molecular mechanisms like cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. BHLHA9 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system.
