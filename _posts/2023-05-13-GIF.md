# Gene GIF

## Information

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome X: 6,630,292-6,636,383
- **Pathology**: GIF mutations are associated with X-linked intellectual disability.
- **Function**: The GIF gene encodes a neuropeptide that functions as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, specifically in the regulation of appetite.
