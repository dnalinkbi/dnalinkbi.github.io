## Information about Gene CADM1

### Genetic Position
The CADM1 gene is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q23.3.

### Pathology
Alterations in the CADM1 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma.

### Function
The CADM1 gene codes for a cell adhesion molecule (CADM1 protein) which is involved in the adhesion and communication between cells. The protein is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in the formation of synapses. It has also been shown to have a role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.

### Related Disease
CADM1 alterations have been associated with the development and progression of various types of cancer, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Further research is required to develop targeted therapies for CADM1-related cancers.

### Drug Response
There is currently no FDA-approved drug available that specifically targets CADM1.
