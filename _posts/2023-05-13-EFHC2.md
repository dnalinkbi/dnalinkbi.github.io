# Information about gene EFHC2

## Genetic position
The EF-hand domain-containing protein 2 gene (EFHC2) is located on human chromosome 6p12.1.

## Pathology and function
EFHC2 plays a crucial role in neuronal development and function. Mutations in the EFHC2 gene have been found to be associated with several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and intellectual disability.

## Function for gene
EFHC2 encodes a protein with several EF-hand domains that are involved in calcium binding. The protein has been shown to interact with G-protein signaling pathways, and to regulate neuronal excitability. In addition, EFHC2 is involved in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines, which are important for synaptic connectivity.

## Related disease
Mutations in the EFHC2 gene have been found to be associated with several neurological disorders, including:
- Epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic (OMIM: 254770)
- Schizophrenia (OMIM: 181500)
- Intellectual disability (OMIM: 300354)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for EFHC2-related disorders. Treatment is generally focused on managing symptoms, which may include anticonvulsant medications for epilepsy and antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. The prognosis for EFHC2-related disorders varies depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
There is currently no information about drug response in individuals with mutations in the EFHC2 gene.
