## Gene: IKZF1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Start Position: 50,255,520 bp
- End Position: 50,295,162 bp

### Pathology
- IKZF1 gene is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. In ALL, immature white blood cells are produced in large quantities and crowd out normal, healthy cells.

### Function
- The IKZF1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in lymphocyte development. It regulates the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, and it is important for the development of B and T lymphocytes.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.P168fs (frameshift) - rs1554272359
- p.K159E (missense) - rs137853137
- p.N159S (missense) - rs115431848

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.1395G>A - rs116814719
- c.687+1G>T - rs3092426
- c.817C>G - rs368543047

### Related Disease
- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for ALL may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, and targeted therapy.

### Drug Response
- IKZF1 may play a role in drug resistance in ALL. Several studies have suggested that IKZF1 mutations are associated with poorer response to certain chemotherapy agents, such as glucocorticoids.
