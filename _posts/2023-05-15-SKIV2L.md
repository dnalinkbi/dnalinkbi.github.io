## Gene: SKIV2L

### Gene Information:
- **Function:** The SKIV2L gene encodes for Ski2-like RNA helicase protein which is involved in RNA processing and degradation pathways.
- **External IDs:** 
    * Gene ID: 11283
    * Genomic Location: Chromosome 1, 1p34.3
    * Aliases: KIAA0101, MTR4

### Mutations:
- **AA Mutation List:** Several missense mutations, synonymous mutations, and splice site variants are reported in the SKIV2L gene.
- **Mutation Type:** Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and Insertion-Deletion polymorphisms (InDels)
- **dbSNP ID:** rs3807903, rs2277538, rs36000453, rs149033935, rs1369336081, rs772660505

### Related Diseases:
- **Disease:** Trichothiodystrophy
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive
- **Description:** Trichothiodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by brittle hair, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and short stature. Mutations in the SKIV2L gene are associated with this disease.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Currently, there is no cure for Trichothiodystrophy but symptomatic treatments such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can improve the quality of life of the affected individuals.
- The prognosis varies from individual to individual and depends on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response:
- Currently, there are no specific drugs available to treat Trichothiodystrophy, however, several clinical trials are underway to investigate the efficacy of gene therapy and other targeted therapies.
