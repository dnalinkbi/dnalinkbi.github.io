## Gene SPRY2

### Genetic Position

The SPRY2 gene is located on chromosome 13, position 13q31.1.

### Pathology

The SPRY2 gene has been associated with several pathological conditions such as cancers (e.g., prostate cancer), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), cardiovascular diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis), and congenital abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial malformations).

### Function

The SPRY2 gene encodes a protein known as Sprouty2, which functions as a negative regulator of several signaling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. These pathways are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and metabolism.

- Prostate cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Non-small cell lung cancer
- Glioblastoma
- Alzheimer’s disease
- Atherosclerosis
- Craniofacial malformations

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment available for SPRY2-related diseases. However, some ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the effectiveness of targeted therapies that inhibit the SPRY2 protein in various cancers.

### Drug Response

The response of SPRY2-related diseases to drugs depends on the specific disease and its underlying mechanism. In general, targeted therapies that inhibit the SPRY2 protein have shown promising results in preclinical studies.
