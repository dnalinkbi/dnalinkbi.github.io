# Gene Information for FRA10AC1

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

The FRA10AC1 gene is located on chromosome 10q23.31. It is a fragile site that is commonly associated with chromosomal breakage and rearrangements. The gene is part of a larger region that is susceptible to deletion or amplification events that can lead to various genetic disorders, including cancers.

The function of FRA10AC1 is not well understood. However, it is believed to be involved in maintaining chromosome stability and preventing aberrant recombination events.
