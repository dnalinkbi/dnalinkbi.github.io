# Gene Information for ALK

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** The ALK gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 23.1 (2q23.1).

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the ALK gene are associated with various types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and neuroblastoma.

- **Function:** The ALK gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell growth and differentiation. It is involved in the development of the nervous system and is important for the survival of certain neurons.

## Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases, and External IDs

- **Gene Name:** ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)

- **Aliases:** CD246, NBLST3

- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 417
    - NCBI Entrez: 238
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000171094
    - OMIM: 105590
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UM73

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- The following are some of the amino acid mutations that have been reported in the ALK gene:
    - L1196M (rs121913527)
    - F1174L (rs121913526)
    - R1275Q (rs121913529)
    - G1269A (rs121913528)

- These mutations are mostly missense mutations, which result in a change in a single amino acid in the ALK protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- The following are some of the somatic SNVs/InDels that have been reported in the ALK gene:
    - c.3739_3740insAA (rs397507267)
    - c.3481_3491delAGCAAGCGGAA (rs398123027)
    - c.3946_3952delTCTGACC (rs397507268)

## Related Disease
