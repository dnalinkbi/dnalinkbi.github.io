## Information about gene INVS

### Genetic Position
The gene INVS, also known as inversin, is located at chromosome 9q31.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the INVS gene are associated with nephronophthisis, a genetic disorder that affects kidney function. It is characterized by a loss of kidney function due to defects in the tubules of the kidneys that cause scarring and cysts to form.

### Function
The INVS gene encodes for a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of the cilia in the kidneys. Cilia play an important role in transporting fluids through tubules in the kidneys, and defects in cilia function can lead to the development of nephronophthisis.

### Related Disease
Mutations in INVS are associated with nephronophthisis, a genetic disorder that affects kidney function. It is characterized by a loss of kidney function due to defects in the tubules of the kidneys that cause scarring and cysts to form.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for nephronophthisis, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. This may include medications to control blood pressure and reduce fluid buildup in the body.

### Drug Response
There is no information available on drug response specifically related to mutations in the INVS gene.
