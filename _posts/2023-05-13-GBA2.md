## Gene: GBA2

### Information

- **Function for gene:** The GBA2 gene encodes for the enzyme glucosylceramidase beta 2 (GBA2), which plays a role in lipid metabolism and cell signaling.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 4154
    - NCBI Entrez: 57707
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000176532
    - OMIM: 609471
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HCG7
    
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
There are various AA mutations reported in the GBA2 gene, including:
    - p.Leu279Pro (rs61732940)
    - p.Arg483Leu (rs199672364)
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are various reported SNVs/InDels in the GBA2 gene. However, most of them do not have a dbSNP ID.

- **Related disease:** Mutations in the GBA2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, and atypical Gaucher disease.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options for GBA2-related diseases vary depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms. Currently, there is no cure for these diseases, and treatment is primarily supportive and symptomatic.

- **Drug response:** There are currently no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of GBA2-related diseases. However, enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to be effective in treating some forms of Gaucher disease.
