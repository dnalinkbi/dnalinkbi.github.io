# Information about MUTYH Gene

## Genetic Position
The MUTYH gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 34.2 (1p34.2). 

## Pathology
Mutations in the MUTYH gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called MUTYH-associated polyposis. This condition increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer, among other types of cancer. MUTYH mutations impair the ability of the gene to repair damaged DNA, leading to an accumulation of mutations and genomic instability.

## Function
The MUTYH gene provides instructions for producing a protein called MUTYH glycosylase. This protein plays a critical role in DNA repair by removing DNA damage caused by oxidation. It specifically removes adenine paired with 8-oxoguanine which can cause G:C to T:A transversions.

## Related Disease
MUTYH-associated polyposis is a disease caused by pathogenic mutations in the MUTYH gene. It increases the risk of colorectal cancer, among other types of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with MUTYH-associated polyposis may require regular colonoscopies and surveillance for other cancers. Colectomy (removal of the colon) may be necessary in some cases to reduce the risk of cancer. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the mutations and early detection and management of associated cancers.

## Drug Response
Current research is investigating the potential use of PARP inhibitors in individuals with MUTYH-associated polyposis. PARP inhibitors have shown promise in treating other types of cancers with DNA repair defects.
