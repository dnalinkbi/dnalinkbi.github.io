# Gene Information for NPM1

**Gene:** NPM1 (Nucleophosmin 1)

**Function:** NPM1 gene encodes for a nucleolar phosphoprotein which is involved in several cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, genome maintenance, and stress response pathways in the cell.

**Genomic location:** Chromosome 5 (5q35.1)

**Aliases:** B23, NPM, Nucleolar phosphoprotein B23

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 7973
- NCBI Entrez: 4869
- Ensembl: ENSG00000181027
- OMIM: 164040
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P06748

**AA Mutation List:** 
- p.W288C
- p.W288G
- p.W288S
- p.W288R
- p.Y288C
- p.Y288H
- p.F279C
- p.F279S

**Mutation Type:** Missense 

**dbSNP ID:** rs115387827, rs121434568, rs121434569, rs121434571, rs121434570, rs121434572, rs755622422, rs755622423

**Related Disease:** 
- Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
- Acute myeloid leukemia
- Lung cancer
- Breast cancer 

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
- The prognosis for NPM1-mutated AML is favorable compared to AML that does not have the NPM1 mutation. 
- In terms of treatment, a consolidation chemotherapy regimen of high-dose Cytarabine (HiDAC) followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) can be effective. 

**Drug Response:**
- NPM1 mutations have been associated with resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in breast cancer.
