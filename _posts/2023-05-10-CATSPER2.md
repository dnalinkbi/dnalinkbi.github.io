# Gene Information for CATSPER2

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

The CATSPER2 gene is located on chromosome 15 in humans and is associated with male fertility. Mutations in this gene have been linked to male infertility, specifically to the inability of sperm cells to swim correctly (asthenozoospermia).

## Function for Gene

The CATSPER2 gene is involved in regulating a calcium channel in the sperm cell that is essential for sperm motility and fertilization.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported missense mutations in the CATSPER2 gene that are associated with asthenozoospermia and male infertility. Some examples include:

- p.A386T (rs144731200)
- p.R250C (rs200888070)
- p.L386F (rs192094372)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic mutations in the CATSPER2 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CATSPER2 gene have been associated with male infertility and asthenozoospermia.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for male infertility caused by CATSPER2 mutations. However, there are treatments available, such as assisted reproductive technology (ART) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), that can help couples conceive despite infertility.

## Drug Response

There are currently no drugs available that target the CATSPER2 gene specifically. However, research is ongoing to identify potential treatments for male infertility.
