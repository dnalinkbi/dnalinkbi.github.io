# Information about gene NTHL1

## Genetic Position:

NTHL1 is located on chromosome 16q24.3.

## Pathology:

Mutations in the NTHL1 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called NTHL1-associated polyposis (NAP). People with NAP have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and other cancers.

## Function:

The NTHL1 gene provides instructions for making a DNA repair enzyme that corrects errors that occur when DNA is copied. Specifically, this enzyme repairs a type of DNA damage called oxidative damage.

## External IDs and Aliases:

- HGNC: 7962
- NCBI Entrez: 4912
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163738
- OMIM: 600284
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UIF7

Aliases: NTH1, NTH15

## AA mutation list:

Some of the common mutations in the NTHL1 gene are:

- p.Thr55Ala
- p.Phe224Leufs*13
- p.Leu245Valfs*31
- p.Glu242Glyfs*25
- p.Arg306Glnfs*25
- p.Glu227Glyfs*8

## Mutation Type:

Most of the mutations in the NTHL1 gene are missense mutations, frameshift mutations, or nonsense mutations.

## dbSNP ID:

Some of the dbSNP IDs associated with the mutations in the NTHL1 gene are:

- rs267607314
- rs587783985
- rs149013049
- rs587783985
- rs267607313

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:

Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the NTHL1 gene are:

- rs145914554
- rs267607313
- rs587783985

## Related Disease:

NTHL1-associated polyposis (NAP) 

## Treatment and prognosis:

There is no cure for NTHL1-associated polyposis (NAP). Treatments usually involve regular colonoscopy screenings and removal of polyps before they turn cancerous. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the mutations and the age of onset.

## Drug response:

There is limited information available on drug responses related to NTHL1 mutations.
