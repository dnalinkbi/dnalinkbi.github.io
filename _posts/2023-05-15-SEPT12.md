## Gene Information
- Gene: SEPT12
- Function: Septins are GTP-binding proteins involved in various cellular processes such as cytokinesis, membrane dynamics, and vesicular trafficking. SEPT12 is a member of the mammalian septins, which are a conserved family of proteins that localize to diverse cellular structures and play a role in diverse biological processes. 
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 16q23.1
- Aliases: CDCREL, KIAA1783
