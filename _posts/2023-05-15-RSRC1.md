# Genetic information on gene RSRC1

* **Function for gene**: RSRC1 (Arginine/Serine Rich Coiled-Coil 1) has been identified as a component of the spliceosome. It is involved in the processing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells.

* **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**:
    - Gene ID (HGNC): HGNC:28466
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 126561
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000115195
    - Aliases: C6orf205
