# Information about Gene SLFN5:

## Genetic Position:
SLFN5 is a gene located on chromosome 17q21.2.

## Pathology: 
Mutations in SLFN5 have been associated with various types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer.

## Function:
SLFN5 encodes for a protein that belongs to the Schlafen family of proteins. The exact function of SLFN5 is not well understood, but studies have suggested that it may play a role in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, RNA processing, and immune response.

## External IDs and Aliases:
- Gene ID: 85303
- Genomic Location: chr17:40,144,729-40,146,144
- Aliases: KIAA0648, SLFNL2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- c.505G>A (p.A169T) - rs2293819
- c.677G>A (p.G226E) - rs188332110
- c.943C>T (p.L315F) - rs35501917

- c.974_978delAACAG (p.N325fs) - rs1554527329

## Related Disease:
SLFN5 mutations have been implicated in the development and progression of several cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
The prognostic and therapeutic implications of SLFN5 mutations in cancer are still being investigated.

## Drug Response:
Some studies have suggested that SLFN5 is associated with sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as topoisomerase inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents, in cancer cells.
