# Gene GLRX5

## Information 
- **Function:** The gene GLRX5 encodes a protein belonging to the glutaredoxin family which acts as an iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis protein. It plays a crucial role in maturation of mitochondrial Fe-S proteins.   

- **External IDs:** The gene GLRX5 is also known as FLJ20132, HSGALM or IRP. Its genomic location is on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q32.2)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** 
There are currently no entries in dbSNP for somatic SNVs/InDels in GLRX5.

- **Related disease:** Mutations in GLRX5 are associated with multiple diseases. These include:
    - Anemia, sideroblastic, 3 (OMIM #616860)
    - Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma, 8 (OMIM #617141)
    - Diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent (OMIM #125853)

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with GLRX5 mutations vary greatly depending on the specific disease and severity. Therefore, a personalized approach is recommended.

- **Drug response:** Currently, there are no drugs targeting GLRX5 gene for the treatment of diseases.
