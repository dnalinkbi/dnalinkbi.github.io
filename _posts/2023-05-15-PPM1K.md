# Information about Gene PPM1K

## Genetic Position and Basic Information
- PPM1K gene is located on chromosome 4, at position 4q21.1
- The gene has a size of 72 kilobases and contains 21 exons
- PPM1K encodes for a protein phosphatase known as PPM1K or Wip1, which is composed of 639 amino acids

## Pathology and Function for Gene
- PPM1K is known to play a key role in regulating the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stabilization. 
- PPM1K is involved in several aspects of the DNA damage response pathway, including checkpoint recovery, DNA repair, and cell survival.
- PPM1K overexpression has been associated with tumor progression and resistance to anticancer therapies. 

## External IDs and Aliases
- Official Gene Symbol: PPM1K 
- Other Aliases: Wip1, PP2C-DELTA
- External IDs: HGNC ID: 21469, NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 54962, Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000164121, OMIM ID: 607225, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q96QG7

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Some of the common non-synonymous mutations associated with PPM1K include:
    - R194Q (rs3763309)
    - R459C (rs28937905)
    - S191C (rs199967449)
- Mutation Type: Missense Mutations
- dbSNP ID: rsID for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Some of the common somatic variants in PPM1K include:
    - c.1759C>T (p.Ser587Leu) (rs143348094)
    - c.88A>T (p.Gln30Leu) (rs202090726)
    - c.767A>G (p.Gln256Arg) (rs138836660)
- Mutation Type: Somatic SNVs (single nucleotide variants) and InDels (insertions or deletions)
- dbSNP ID: rsID for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

## Related Disease
- PPM1K mutations have been associated with several types of cancers such as:
    - Breast Cancer
    - Colorectal Cancer
    - Ovarian Cancer
    - Lung Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Studies have shown that PPM1K overexpression can lead to resistance towards chemotherapy and radiotherapy; therefore, PPM1K has been proposed as a promising target for cancer treatment. 
- Inhibition of PPM1K activity has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents.

## Drug Response
- Several PPM1K inhibitors are currently under development, such as:
   - GSK2830371
   - CCT007093
   - SM-164
