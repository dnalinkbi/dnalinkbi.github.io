## Gene: PRKAR1A

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: p13.1

### Pathology
- PRKAR1A is a tumor suppressor gene.
- Inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A have been linked to the development of Carney complex, a rare familial multiple neoplasia syndrome.

### Function
- PRKAR1A encodes protein kinase A regulatory subunit type 1 alpha, which is a critical component of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway.
- PKA regulates a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, transcription, and differentiation.

### Related Disease
- Carney complex - a rare familial multiple neoplasia syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for Carney complex.
- Treatment typically involves surgery to remove tumors and/or medication to manage symptoms.
- Prognosis depends on the specific tumors and their stage at diagnosis.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no targeted therapy for Carney complex.
