# Gene Information for PRKDC

### Genetic Position
* The PRKDC gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q11.2).
* It spans 250.9 kbp and contains 86 exons.

### Pathology
* Mutations or dysregulation of PRKDC can lead to various disorders including immunodeficiency with sensitivity to ionizing radiation (OMIM: #611291).

### Function
* PRKDC encodes for DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a critical role in DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
* It is also involved in V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte development.
* Additionally, PRKDC plays a role in telomere maintenance and chromosomal stability.
