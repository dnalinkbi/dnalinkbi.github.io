# Genetic Information Analysis for gene IRF6
## Genetic Position
IRF6 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 6) is located on the chromosomal region 1q32.2, and consists of 10 exons. 

## Pathology and Function
IRF6 is a transcriptional regulator that plays an important role in the development of ectodermal tissues such as skin, oral mucosa, and limbs. Mutations in the IRF6 gene have been associated with several disorders such as Van der Woude syndrome, popliteal pterygium syndrome, and orofacial clefting. It is also involved in the regulation of immune response and inflammation.

## Related Disease
IRF6 mutations are associated with several disorders including:
- Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) 
- Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS)
- Orofacial clefting

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for IRF6-associated disorders. Management involves symptomatic treatment and surgical intervention for cleft lip/palate and other physical abnormalities.

## Drug Response
There is no established drug treatment specific to IRF6-associated disorders.
