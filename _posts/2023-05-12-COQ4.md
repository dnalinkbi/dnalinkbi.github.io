# COQ4 Gene Information

## Genetic position
The COQ4 gene is located on chromosome 9 in humans, specifically at the position 9q34.13.

## Pathology and Function
COQ4 encodes a protein that is part of the coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis pathway, responsible for producing CoQ10, a molecule involved in mitochondrial respiration. Mutations in COQ4 have been associated with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency, a rare but severe disorder characterized by neurological and muscular dysfunction. 

### Function for gene
The COQ4 gene is involved in the biosynthesis pathway for CoQ10, a molecule necessary for mitochondrial respiration.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 24024
- NCBI Entrez: 79011
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137100
- OMIM: 616359
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y2Z5
- Aliases: ADCK4, COQ4A, FLJ23725

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Some of the known COQ4 mutations include:
- p.R239W (missense mutation)
- p.A373V (missense mutation)
- p.R288X (nonsense mutation)

These mutations have been found in patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Several dbSNP IDs are associated with these mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is currently no known association between COQ4 and somatic SNVs/InDels.

### Related Disease
Mutations in COQ4 have been associated with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency, a rare disorder with neurological and muscular symptoms.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Supplementation with CoQ10 has been shown to improve symptoms in some patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. However, the prognosis for this disorder can vary widely depending on the specific mutation and severity of symptoms.

### Drug response
Studies have shown that some patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency may respond to CoQ10 supplementation, but further research is needed.
