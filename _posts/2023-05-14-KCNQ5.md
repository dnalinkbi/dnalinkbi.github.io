# Information about gene KCNQ5

## Genetic Position
The gene KCNQ5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 at position 12.3 (6q12.3).

## Pathology
Several studies have implicated KCNQ5 in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Function
The KCNQ5 gene encodes a potassium channel protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the excitability of neurons. Specifically, it contributes to the repolarization phase of the action potential by outwardly rectifying the potassium current.
