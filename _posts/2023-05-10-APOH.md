# Gene APOH

## Information about Gene APOH:
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17q24.2
- **Pathology:** APOH gene is associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
- **Function:** APOH gene encodes a plasma glycoprotein called beta-2-glycoprotein 1. This protein is involved in various physiological processes, including blood coagulation, complement activation, and lipoprotein binding.

## Gene Details:
- **External IDs:** HGNC:617, NCBI Entrez:325, Ensembl:ENSG00000108771, OMIM:138700, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P02749
- **Aliases:** Apolipoprotein H, Beta-2-glycoprotein 1

## Mutation Information:
- **AA Mutation List:** APOH gene mutation causes missense mutation in the protein sequence. The most commonly identified missense mutations include R218W, V247M, and N3I.
- **Mutation Type:** Missense Mutation
- **dbSNP ID:** rs1801690, rs1801689, rs1801691

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- No significant somatic mutations have been reported for the APOH gene.

## Related Diseases:
- APOH gene is associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and antiphospholipid syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- The treatment and prognosis of APOH gene-related diseases depend on the specific disease and its severity.

## Drug Response:
- The drug response of APOH gene-related diseases depends on the specific disease and its severity.
