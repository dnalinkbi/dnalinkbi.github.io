## Gene SAMD9

**Genetic Position:** SAMD9 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21.2).

**Pathology:** SAMD9 mutations have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called MIRAGE syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by myelodysplasia, recurrent infections, growth retardation, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy.

**Function:** SAMD9 is involved in several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It regulates the interferon signaling pathway and has been shown to suppress tumor growth.

**External IDs:**
- Gene ID: 54807
- Genomic Location: Chr7: 90,124,640-90,256,116
- Aliases: MIRAGE Syndrome, SAMD9B

- HGNC: 10559
- NCBI Entrez: 54807
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106588

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** No AA mutation list was found in dbSNP.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No somatic SNVs/InDels were found in dbSNP.

**Related Disease:** MIRAGE Syndrome is associated with mutations in SAMD9 gene.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for MIRAGE Syndrome, and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. The prognosis is poor, and patients are at a high risk of developing opportunistic infections and malignancies.

**Drug Response:** No drug response information was found for SAMD9 gene.
