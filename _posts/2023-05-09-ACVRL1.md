## Gene Information 

The gene ACVRL1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12, specifically at position 12q13.13. It encodes the protein activin A receptor type II-like 1, which is a member of the TGF-beta receptor family.

## Function 

The protein encoded by ACVRL1 is a receptor that binds to activin, bone morphogenetic protein, and other TGF-beta ligands. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of angiogenesis, as well as in the development and maintenance of blood vessels.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels affecting ACVRL1.

## Related Disease 

Mutations in ACVRL1 have been associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. HHT is a rare genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and organs. It is characterized by recurrent nosebleeds, telangiectases (small, dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin), and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

## Treatment and Prognosis 

There is currently no cure for HHT, but symptoms can be managed with supportive therapy. Treatments may include laser therapy, embolization, or surgery to treat telangiectases and AVMs. Treatment for nosebleeds may involve topical medications, cauterization, or nasal packing. Patients with HHT should receive regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider, as well as genetic counseling.

Prognosis for HHT patients may vary, depending on the severity and location of AVMs, and any associated complications. 

## Drug response 

There is currently limited information available regarding drug response for ACVRL1 mutations and HHT. However, ongoing studies are exploring potential treatments and therapies for HHT. The drug Avastin (bevacizumab) has been found to be effective in treating select HHT patients with severe liver involvement.
