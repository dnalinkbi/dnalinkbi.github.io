## Gene LTC4S

LTC4S (Leukotriene C4 Synthase) is a gene located on chromosome 5q35.1. Its function is to encode an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from Leukotriene A4 (LTA4).

### Related Disease

Mutations in the LTC4S gene have been associated with various medical conditions including Asthma, Allergic rhinitis, and Cardiovascular Disease. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment or cure for genetic mutations in the LTC4S gene. However, some studies have shown that drugs that target the leukotriene pathway, such as Montelukast and Zafirlukast, can be effective in treating asthma and related conditions. The prognosis for individuals with LTC4S mutations can vary depending on the severity of the associated condition.

### Drug Response

Genetic mutations in the LTC4S gene can also influence an individual's response to certain drugs. For example, a study has shown that the asthma drug Montelukast is less effective in individuals with specific LTC4S gene variants.
