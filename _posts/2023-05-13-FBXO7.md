## Gene: FBXO7

### Genetic Position:
The gene FBXO7 is located on chromosome 22q12.3.

### Pathology:
Mutations in the FBXO7 gene are associated with a rare form of inherited Parkinson's disease, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as atypical juvenile parkinsonism and hereditary spastic paraplegia.

### Function:
The FBXO7 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for the degradation of damaged or unnecessary proteins in the cell.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 17908
- NCBI Entrez: 25793
- Ensembl: ENSG00000128274
- OMIM: 605648
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UK90

Aliases:
- F-box only protein 7
- F-box protein 7
- FBX7

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Gln131Glu (rs137852912)
- p.Pro275Leu (rs387907013)
- p.Ala390Thr (rs548016389)

These mutations are missense mutations, which means that a single nucleotide change in the gene's DNA results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
None reported in dbSNP.

### Related Disease:
Mutations in FBXO7 are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, atypical juvenile parkinsonism, and hereditary spastic paraplegia.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no cure for neurodegenerative disorders associated with mutations in FBXO7. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms, which can include medication to manage movement difficulties and physical therapy.

### Drug Response:
There is limited information available regarding drug response specifically related to FBXO7 mutations.
