# Gene PTK6

## Genetic position and Location
- PTK6 gene is located on chromosome 20 at the position 20q13.33. 

## Pathology and Function for Gene
- PTK6 (ProteinTyrosine Kinase 6) gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in cellular signaling pathways for cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is also known as Brk (breast tumor kinase). PTK6 has been found to be overexpressed in cancers such as breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate. It has been suggested that PTK6 plays a role in cancer development and progression by regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and differentiation.

## Related Disease
- Overexpression and mutation of the PTK6 gene have been associated with various cancers such as breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The role of PTK6 in cancer progression makes it a potential target for cancer therapy. Inhibition of PTK6 has been found to suppress cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis in preclinical studies. However, more research is needed to understand the efficacy and safety of PTK6 inhibitors in humans. 
- The prognosis of patients with PTK6-overexpressing or mutated cancers varies depending on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that specifically target PTK6. However, a number of small molecule inhibitors of PTK6 are being developed and tested in preclinical studies.
