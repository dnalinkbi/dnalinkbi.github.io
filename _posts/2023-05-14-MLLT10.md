## Information about gene MLLT10

### Genetic Position
MLLT10 (also known as AF10) is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22.1).

### Pathology
MLLT10 has been identified as part of a chromosomal translocation (10q22.1-10p12) associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The translocation creates a fusion protein involving MLLT10 and the gene AF6 (MLLT6), resulting in the transcriptional activation of oncogenes.

### Function
MLLT10 encodes a transcriptional co-activator that plays a role in hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation. The protein contains a four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions.

- c.974_975delinsTC (rs1064793832)
- c.103_104del (rs1057518592)
- c.659_660insCGCCC (rs1064793831)

### Related Disease
Chromosomal translocations involving MLLT10 have been identified in AML and other hematologic malignancies.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for AML and other hematologic malignancies involving MLLT10 translocations typically involves intensive chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation. Prognosis depends on various factors including age, overall health, and response to treatment.

### Drug Response
MLLT10 is not currently known to be a target for any specific drugs.
