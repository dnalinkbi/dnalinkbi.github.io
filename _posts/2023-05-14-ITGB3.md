# Information about Gene ITGB3

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** ITGB3
- **Function for gene:** This gene encodes a protein involved in blood clotting and platelet aggregation, specifically as a subunit of the integrin αIIbβ3 complex on the surface of platelets.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - **HGNC ID:** HGNC:6159
    - **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 3690
    - **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000133808
    - **Aliases:** CD61, GP3A
    
## Mutations Information
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.2020C>T (p.Leu674Phe) rs5912
    - c.776C>T (p.Pro259Leu) rs3211938
    - c.295G>A (p.Arg99Gln) rs11728517
    - c.803G>A (p.Arg268Gln) rs1143627
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.1440+1G>A rs761156508
    - c.1123A>G (p.Thr375Ala) rs3791676
    
## Related Disease
- **Disease:** Glanzmann thrombasthenia
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive
- **Symptoms:** Excessive bleeding and bruising
- **Cause:** Mutations in ITGB3 gene that cause defects in the integrin αIIbβ3 complex on the surface of platelets.
- **Disease mechanism:** Platelets are unable to aggregate normally leading to bleeding episodes.

## Treatment and prognosis
- **Treatment:** Currently there is no cure for Glanzmann thrombasthenia, treatment involves symptomatic management with platelet transfusions, drugs to enhance platelet function, and surgery.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the frequency and severity of bleeding episodes.

## Drug Response
- **Drug response:** Some individuals with Glanzmann thrombasthenia may respond well to drugs such as desmopressin which stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor which in turn binds platelets and enhances their function.
