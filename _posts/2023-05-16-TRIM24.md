# Gene TRIM24

## Information

TRIM24 is a gene also known as transcription intermediary factor 1-alpha (TIF1Î±) which is involved in transcriptional regulation. It is located on chromosome 7q33.3 and spans 127,339 bases. Its aliases include RNF82, TIF1, and TIF1ALPHA.

External sites that provide information on the TRIM24 gene include:

- HGNC: HGNC:12400
- NCBI Entrez: 8805
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106106
- OMIM: 602652
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q12830

## Function

TRIM24 acts as a transcriptional co-regulator and is involved in various processes such as differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. It facilitates the recruitment of transcription factors to promoters and enhances their transcriptional activity. Additionally, TRIM24 has E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and participates in chromatin remodeling.

## Mutations

There are various mutations associated with the TRIM24 gene, some of which are:

- AA mutation list: A16V, S1060P, R21W, S80F, A877T, G433S, and G433R.
- Mutation type: missense variants, frameshift variants, and nonsense variants. 
- dbSNP ID: rs748176250, rs146239491, rs540343200, rs553844039, rs372643531, and rs863224557.

Some somatic SNVs/InDels (Single Nucleotide Variations/Insertions or Deletions) with dbSNP ID are:

- rs140089582: a missense mutation that leads to the alteration of the protein and affects its function.
- rs2132352: somatic mutation that could act as a driver mutation of hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Related Disease

TRIM24 mutations have been associated with a variety of diseases such as cancer, developmental disorders, immune system disorders, and infectious diseases. 

In cancer, TRIM24 amplification has been reported in multiple types of cancer, including liver, breast, and lung cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis. Additionally, mutations in TRIM24 have been reported in breast, pancreatic, and thyroid cancers.

## Treatment

TRIM24 is a potential therapeutic target for various types of cancer. Some strategies that have been proposed are:

- Inhibition of its ligand-binding domain to suppress its oncogenic activity.
- Inhibition of its ligase activity to promote tumor cell apoptosis.
- Inhibition of its interaction with transcription factors to reduce its oncogenic effects.

## Prognosis

TRIM24 expression has been linked to tumor progression and poor outcome in various types of cancer. In some studies, its overexpression has been associated with worse overall survival and increased risk of metastasis.

## Drug Response

Recent studies suggest that TRIM24 levels in cancer cells may predict the response to certain drugs. For instance, high TRIM24 expression levels have been associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug tamoxifen in breast cancer patients.
