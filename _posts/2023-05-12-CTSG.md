## Gene Information

The CTSG gene encodes for the Cathepsin G enzyme, which is a serine protease that cleaves peptide bonds primarily after aromatic or large hydrophobic amino acid residues. The gene is located on chromosome 14q11.2 and has aliases such as CTSGL1, myeloblastin, and human leukocyte proteinase 3. 

## Function for Gene

The Cathepsin G enzyme encoded by the CTSG gene is involved in the immune response by destroying bacteria. The enzyme also has a role in extracellular matrix degradation, which is necessary for processes like tissue remodeling and development.

## External IDs

Some external IDs associated with the CTSG gene are:

- HGNC: 2522
- NCBI Entrez: 1511
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130716
- OMIM: 176760
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08311

## AA Mutation List 

The following is a list of amino acid (AA) mutations with mutation type and dbSNP ID associated with the CTSG gene:

- c.509T>C (p.Leu170Ser) missense variation with dbSNP ID: rs2234926
- c.604A>G (p.Thr202Ala) missense variation with dbSNP ID: rs2234928

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There is no known list of somatic SNVs or InDels associated with the CTSG gene.

## Related Disease

The CTSG gene has been associated with various diseases such as:

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Periodontitis
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Emphysema

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known cure for diseases caused by the CTSG gene. However, treatments like antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended. The prognosis for patients with CTSG-related diseases varies depending on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response

The CTSG gene has been associated with drug responses to tetracycline antibiotics and beta-agonist bronchodilators.
