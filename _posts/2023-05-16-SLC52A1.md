## Gene SLC52A1

### Genetic Position
The SLC52A1 gene is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17q12.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SLC52A1 gene are associated with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) and Fazio-Londe disease (FLD). These are rare neurological disorders that are characterized by progressive motor and sensory neuron dysfunction.

### Function
The SLC52A1 gene encodes a riboflavin transporter that is involved in the absorption of vitamin B2 in the small intestine.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the SLC52A1 gene.

### Related Disease
- Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS)
- Fazio-Londe disease (FLD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for BVVLS and FLD. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis for these disorders is generally poor, with individuals experiencing progressive neurological decline.

### Drug Response
There is currently no drug response information available for mutations in the SLC52A1 gene.
