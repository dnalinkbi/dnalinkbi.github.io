# Information on Gene KRAS

## Gene Background
- **Gene Name:** KRAS
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 12:25398284-25445337
- **Aliases:** KRAS1, K-RAS, c-K-ras, KRAS2, Ki-ras
- **Function for Gene:** The KRAS gene is involved in the creation of a protein that plays a role in cell signaling pathways, which control cell growth and division.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- **HGNC ID:** 6407
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 3845
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000133703
- **OMIM ID:** 190070
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P01116

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- **Mutation Type:** Activating mutations
- **AA Mutation List:**
  - G12C (dbSNP ID: rs121913530)
  - G12D (dbSNP ID: rs121913529)
  - G12A (dbSNP ID: rs11554290)
  - G12S (dbSNP ID: rs11554285)
  - G12R (dbSNP ID: rs121913528)
  - G13D (dbSNP ID: rs121913526)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- **Somatic Mutations:** Somatic mutations in KRAS have been linked to various cancers, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
- **dbSNP ID:** rs121913529, rs59001820, rs1057520607, rs104895052

## Related Diseases:
- **Disease:** Colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, Noonan syndrome, Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC syndrome).

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Targeted therapy through drugs like cetuximab and panitumumab, which can inhibit the KRAS protein, have been used for cancer treatment. 
- KRAS mutations are associated with poorer outcomes in cancer patients, and have been shown to be resistant to some treatments.

## Drug Response:
- KRAS mutations have been found to be resistant to some treatments, inhibiting the KRAS protein can be beneficial in some cases.
