# Gene ETV4

## Information

Gene ETV4 is located on chromosome 17q12 and has a genomic size of 101.8 kb. It encodes the ETS variant 4 (ETV4) protein. The gene has several aliases including E1A-F, E1AF, p51, and ETV-5.

## Function

The ETV4 protein is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in the development of various tissues including skeletal muscle, kidney, and prostate. It is also involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis in several types of cancer.
