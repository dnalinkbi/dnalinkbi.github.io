# Information about gene NFE2L2

## Genetic Position
Gene: NFE2L2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)

Chromosome: 2

Start position: 177,330,394 bp

End position: 177,401,447 bp

## Pathology and Function
NFE2L2 encode a protein called NRF2, which regulates the expression of antioxidative and detoxifying genes that play crucial roles in the protection of cells against oxidative stress. Mutations in NFE2L2 are associated with several diseases such as inflammation, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.
