## Gene Information

### Gene Name: SEPSECS

### Function: 
The SEPSECS gene encodes for the selenocysteine synthase enzyme, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine, a non-standard amino acid that is found in various proteins with important cellular functions.

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 17968
- Entrez Gene: 27254
- Ensembl: ENSG00000228716
- OMIM: *610746
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9P0M3

### Genomic Location: 
The SEPSECS gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q23).

### Aliases: 
- O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase
- SepSecS

## Mutation Information

### AA Mutation List:
- p.Thr261Ala
- p.Val347Leu
- p.Ala377Ser

### Mutation Type:
The mutations listed above are missense mutations.

### dbSNP ID:

- rs145879421
- rs755625221

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
No information is available on somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene.

## Related Diseases:
The mutations in the SEPSECS gene are associated with the following diseases:
- Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2D (PCH2D)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no known cure for Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2D (PCH2D). Treatment options involve managing the symptoms of the disease, which may include physical therapy, medications, and specialized diets. The prognosis for individuals with PCH2D is generally poor, as the disease is progressive and often fatal.

## Drug Response:
There is currently no drug available that specifically targets mutations in the SEPSECS gene.
