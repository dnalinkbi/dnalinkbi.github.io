# Information about Gene SP8

## Genetic Position
The gene SP8 is located on chromosome 7, specifically at position 7p14.2.

## Pathology and Function
The SP8 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. Studies have shown that it plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system, skeleton, and other organs. Additionally, mutations in the SP8 gene have been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location
- External IDs: HGNC:11272, NCBI Gene ID: 221833, Ensembl: ENSG00000106485, OMIM: 605854, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H2M5
- Aliases: Sp8 transcription factor, bHLHd14
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 7: 26,212,415 - 26,238,520 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported AA mutations in the SP8 gene:
- E261D (dbSNP ID: rs763322701)
- L269F (dbSNP ID: rs730880238)
- S281N (dbSNP ID: rs762410269)
- T345M (dbSNP ID: rs745364592)
- H374R (dbSNP ID: rs767414718)

All of these mutations are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the SP8 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SP8 gene have been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities. Specifically, SP8 mutations have been found to be a cause of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and distinctive facial features.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms, which can include medications for seizures and behavioral therapy.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs that specifically target SP8 gene mutations.
