## Gene Information
- Gene: STK11
- Aliases: LKB1, PJS, STK11S
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 19p13.3

## Function for Gene
STK11 gene encodes for a serine/ threonine kinase protein called STK11 or LKB1, which acts as a tumor suppressor protein. STK11 is involved in the regulation of cellular energy by activating AMPK protein, which controls the production of energy and metabolism. It also plays a role in cell polarity, apoptosis, and cell cycle control.

|Missense|rs61754008|
|Missense|rs3088440|
|Frameshift|rs797044881|
|In-Frame Deletion|rs104894663|

## Related Disease
Germline mutations in the STK11 gene are associated with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by the development of hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutaneous pigmentation. Somatic mutations in the STK11 gene are commonly found in different types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of STK11-associated diseases depend on the specific condition and the severity of the symptoms. For PJS, regular surveillance and removal of polyps is recommended to prevent complications, and genetic counseling is also advised. In some cases, surgical interventions such as gastrectomy or colectomy may be necessary. As for cancer, the presence of STK11 mutations may have prognostic implications and affect the therapeutic options.

## Drug Response
STK11 mutations may affect the response to therapy in cancer patients. It has been reported that tumors with STK11 mutations are more resistant to certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy. On the other hand, recent studies have shown promising results in the use of targeted therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors in STK11-mutant tumors.
