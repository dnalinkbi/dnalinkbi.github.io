# Information about Gene CD38

The CD38 gene is located on chromosome 4q21.21 and encodes for the CD38 protein. The gene has a length of 34,077 base pairs and contains 8 exons.

## Function for Gene

The CD38 protein is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the formation and breakdown of the intracellular messenger molecule cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR). The protein is primarily expressed by immune cells and is involved in several cellular processes such as calcium signaling, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. It also plays a role in regulating insulin secretion and glucose metabolism.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

CD38 has several missense mutations that have been identified in the population. These mutations lead to an alteration in the amino acid sequence of the protein.

The following is a list of some of the missense mutations reported in CD38:

|AA mutation|Mutation type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|P72R|SNV|rs6449182|
|T79N|SNV|rs6449183|
|F135L|SNV|rs6449180|
|R140W|SNV|rs17632542|
|V196M|SNV|rs6449181|
|D266H|SNV|rs12358492|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have also been reported in CD38 in various cancers. These mutations are predominantly missense mutations that result in an alteration in the amino acid sequence of the protein. They have been identified in several cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

## Related Disease

Variations in the CD38 gene are associated with several diseases, including:

- Immune dysfunction
- Autoimmune diseases
- Type 2 diabetes
- Asthma

## Treatment and Prognosis

CD38 inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of multiple myeloma. These drugs target the CD38 protein on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and trigger their destruction by the immune system. Daratumumab and Isatuximab are examples of CD38 inhibitors.

## Drug Response

Recent studies have identified CD38 as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment. It has been observed that high levels of CD38 expression are associated with severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcomes.
