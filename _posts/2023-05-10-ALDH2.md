## Gene: ALDH2

### Basic Information
- Function: The ALDH2 gene encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, which is important for the metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde in the liver. It is responsible for the second step of alcohol oxidation, converting acetaldehyde to acetate.

- External IDs: 
  - HGNC: 396
  - NCBI Entrez: 217
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000111275
  - OMIM: 100650
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P05091

- Genomic Location: Chromosome 12 (12q24.2)


### Mutations and Variations
- AA Mutation List:
  - The most common variant is ALDH2*2 (rs671), which results in a Glu > Lys substitution at residue 504, leading to reduced enzyme activity.
  - Other variants include ALDH2*3 (rs886205), ALDH2*4 (rs3014456), and ALDH2*5 (rs1801272), all of which result in reduced enzyme activity.
- Mutation Type: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
- dbSNP IDs: 
  - rs671
  - rs886205
  - rs3014456
  - rs1801272


### Somatic Variations and Related Diseases
- ALDH2 has been implicated in several diseases, including:
  - Alcohol flush reaction: Individuals with reduced ALDH2 activity are unable to break down acetaldehyde efficiently, leading to flushing, nausea, and other unpleasant symptoms after alcohol consumption.
  - Esophageal cancer: ALDH2 variants have been associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer in Asian populations.
  - Cardiovascular disease: Reduced ALDH2 activity has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly due to increased oxidative stress.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - There are several somatic variants reported for ALDH2 in various cancer types, as listed in dbSNP.


### Treatment, Prognosis, and Drug Response
- Alcohol flush reaction: Individuals with reduced ALDH2 activity are generally advised to limit their alcohol intake or avoid alcohol altogether, as toxic acetaldehyde can accumulate in the body.
- Esophageal cancer: ALDH2 variants may serve as a biomarker for increased risk of esophageal cancer, and can be used for early detection and screening.
- Cardiovascular disease: It is currently unclear whether ALDH2 inhibitors or activators could be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
- Drug response: Certain drugs, such as disulfiram, work by inhibiting ALDH2 activity and can lead to adverse effects in individuals with reduced ALDH2 activity.
