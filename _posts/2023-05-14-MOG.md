## Gene: MOG

### Genetic Position:
MOG (Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at position 15 (6p15).

### Pathology:
MOG-related disorders (MOGAD) are autoimmune-mediated diseases that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The pathophysiology of MOGAD involves the production of autoantibodies against MOG leading to demyelination and axonal injury. MOGAD includes a range of diseases such as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

### Function:
MOG is a transmembrane protein that is expressed exclusively in the CNS. It plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of myelin, which is the insulating layer that surrounds nerve fibers in the CNS.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
There are several known mutations in the MOG gene, including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations. However, there is no specific mutation associated with MOG-related disorders. Here is the list of some amino acid changes with their dbSNP ID:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|A19T | Missense | rs397514523|
|V60L | Missense | rs757198996|
|K114N | Missense | rs773484468|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There is no information available on somatic mutations in the MOG gene reported in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease:
MOG-related disorders (MOGAD) are autoimmune-mediated diseases that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The pathophysiology of MOGAD involves the production of autoantibodies against MOG leading to demyelination and axonal injury. MOGAD includes a range of diseases such as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, there is no cure for MOGAD. Treatment options mainly include immunosuppressive therapy, which controls the inflammation and prevents further damage to the CNS. Prognosis varies from patient to patient, but in general, the disease is considered chronic and progressive.

### Drug Response:
There is no specific drug available for the treatment of MOGAD. However, immunosuppressive therapy can improve the symptoms and prevent further damage to the CNS.
