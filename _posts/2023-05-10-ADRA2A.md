## Gene Information

**Gene:** ADRA2A

**Function:** Adrenoreceptor alpha 2A (ADRA2A) belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family. It is responsible for sympathetic nervous system regulation, which controls stress-induced blood pressure and heart rate responses.

**External IDs and Genomic Location**
- HGNC: 316
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 150
- Ensembl: ENSG00000117400
- OMIM: 104221
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08913
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10 (NC_000010.11); 110,694,478 - 110,730,320 (GRCh38/hg38)

**Aliases:** ADRA2, ADRAR

**Treatment and Prognosis**
Due to the complexity of the conditions associated with ADRA2A, there is no specific treatment for mutations in the gene.

---

**Drug Response**
- Agonists for ADRA2A can potentially be used for the treatment of hypertension, anxiety, and depression. 
- Antagonists for ADRA2A can potentially be used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and drug abuse.
