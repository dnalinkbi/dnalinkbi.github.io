Gene CD96:

- Function: Encodes a transmembrane protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is involved in T-cell activation and proliferation, and may play a role in tumor growth and metastasis.
- External IDs: Gene ID: 10257, Genomic Location: Chr3:191,042,387-191,094,588, Aliases: TACTILE, TSPAN7
- External Sites: 
  - HGNC: HGNC:17720
  - NCBI Entrez: 10257
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000125454
  - OMIM: 606037
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UMW8
- AA mutation list: Some of the missense mutations in the CD96 gene are:
  - p.Ala40Val (dbSNP ID: rs148979604)
  - p.Arg83His (dbSNP ID: rs45531536)
  - p.Ile109Met (dbSNP ID: rs758548175)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: There are several somatic mutations in the CD96 gene that are associated with different types of cancer. Some examples include:
  - c.778G>A (dbSNP ID: rs1555270577)
  - c.773C>T (dbSNP ID: rs778444386)
  - c.431C>T (dbSNP ID: rs759821840)
- Related disease: CD96 gene mutations have been linked to various types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.
- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment options for cancer patients with CD96 mutations typically include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. The prognosis for patients with CD96 mutations varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.
- Drug response: CD96 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer, and there are several drugs that are being developed to target this gene. Some of these drugs include monoclonal antibodies and small molecules.
