# Gene CBS

## Genetic Position
CBS gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in CBS gene cause homocystinuria, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Homocystinuria is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of homocysteine, a toxic amino acid, in the blood and urine. 

## Function
CBS encodes cystathionine beta synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. Cystathionine is further converted to cysteine, an essential amino acid. Therefore, CBS plays a crucial role in the methionine and cysteine metabolism pathways.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Common missense mutations in CBS gene are:
- p.Ile278Thr
- p.Glu336Lys
- p.Gly307Ser

Mutation types:
- Missense - rs121907955, rs121964950, rs121907956, rs121964951

- Nonsense - rs267608679

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in CBS gene are rare and not well-studied. No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CBS gene are associated with homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of homocysteine in the blood and urine. Patients with homocystinuria can present with various symptoms such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, lens dislocation, osteoporosis, and thromboembolic events.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The primary treatment for patients with homocystinuria is a diet low in methionine and high in cysteine. Vitamin B6 supplementation can also be effective for certain types of CBS deficiency. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, the long-term prognosis of homocystinuria is good, and patients can lead a normal life.

## Drug Response
Betaine and N-acetylcysteine are under investigation for the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to CBS deficiency. Cystagon or mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) can also be used for the treatment of cystinuria.
