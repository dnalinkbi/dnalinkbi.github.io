# Information on KDM5C Gene

## Genetic Position
The KDM5C gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.22. It spans approximately 452.65 kb with 32 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations or deletions of the KDM5C gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability syndromes such as the syndromes of Sutherland-Haan, Juberg-Hellman, and Lubs.

## Function 
The KDM5C protein is a histone demethylase that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein plays a crucial role in the development and function of the central nervous system.

## External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 6348
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 8242
- Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000101773
- OMIM: 314690
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O14607
- Aliases: JARID1C, MRXJH, SMCX

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The following are some of the amino acid mutations with mutation type and corresponding dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg842Ter (nonsense), rs104894104
- p.Thr836Arg (missense), rs879255062
- p.Pro417Leu (missense), rs879255064

## Somatic SNV/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNV/InDels with a dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease
The mutations or deletions of the KDM5C gene are associated with syndromes with intellectual disability such as Lujan-Fryns syndrome, X-linked intellectual disability, and syndromes of Sutherland-Haan, Juberg-Hellman and Lubs.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific cure for KDM5C-related genetic conditions. Symptomatic treatment is mainly recommended to improve the quality of life of affected individuals. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to KDM5C gene mutations.
