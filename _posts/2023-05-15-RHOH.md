# Gene Name: RHOH
## Information
- Chromosomal Location: 4p13
- Alias: ARHH, RASL12
- External IDs: HGNC:10006, NCBI Entrez Gene:6007, Ensembl: ENSG00000130724, OMIM: 605981, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15669
## Function
- RHOH gene encodes a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which play a key role in regulating cytokinesis, cell shape, and motility. 
- The protein encoded by RHOH has been shown to interact with regulators of immune cells, suggesting a role in immune cell signaling and function. This gene is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells.
## Mutations
- AA Mutation List: c.83C>T, p.Arg28Ter (rs387906931), c.311delC, p.Gln104SerfsTer6 (rs797045489)
## Related Diseases
- Genetic variations in RHOH have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no known specific treatment for genetic variations in the RHOH gene.
- Prognosis would vary depending on the specific autoimmune disease presented and individual factors.
## Drug Response
- There is no known specific drug response associated with genetic variations in RHOH.
