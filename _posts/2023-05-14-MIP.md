## Gene MIP

### Genetic Position
Gene MIP is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 at the position q24.31.

### Pathology
Mutations in the MIP gene have been associated with various disorders including congenital cataract, posterior polar, 1 (CTPP1), and macular dystrophy, vitelliform, 2 (VMD2).

### Function
MIP encodes for a protein called Aquaporin-0 (AQP0), which is a transmembrane protein found in the lens of the eye and plays a crucial role in maintaining lens transparency and homeostasis.

- p.Arg50Ter (rs104894405) - nonsense
- p.Gln12Ter (rs104894404) - nonsense

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations identified in the MIP gene, however, there are no known SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs.

### Related Disease
MIP mutations are associated with various ocular diseases including congenital cataract and macular dystrophy.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for congenital cataracts, however, surgical intervention is possible. The prognosis depends on the severity of the cataract and other associated ocular complications.

### Drug Response
There are no drugs available that target MIP gene directly, however, treatment options for cataracts and macular dystrophy can help manage symptoms.
