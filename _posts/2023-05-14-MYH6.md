## Gene: MYH6

### Function:
The MYH6 gene encodes the alpha heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin, which constitutes the thick filaments of the cardiac muscle. This protein is involved in the contraction of the heart muscle and plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac function.

### External IDs:
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 14 (14q12)
- Gene ID: 4624
- Aliases: Alpha-MyHC, CMD1EE, CMH10, MGC102156, MGC102158

### Mutation Type:
All of the AA mutations listed above are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the MYH6 gene, including:
- c.142G>A, p.E48K (rs587782041)
- c.1232A>G, p.I411V (rs376044518)
- c.2178A>G, p.I726M (rs767210012)

### Related Disease:
MYH6 mutations have been associated with several cardiac disorders, including:
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- Atrial septal defect (ASD)
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for MYH6-related disorders depend on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. Treatment may include medications to manage symptoms, surgery to correct structural defects, and lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of complications.

### Drug Response:
There is currently no specific drug approved for MYH6-related disorders. However, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms such as heart failure, arrhythmia, and blood pressure.
