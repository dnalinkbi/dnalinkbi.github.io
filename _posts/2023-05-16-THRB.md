# Information about gene THRB

## Genetic Position
The THRB gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3, specifically at the position 3p24.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in THRB have been associated with several disorders, including resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), thyroid hormone receptor-associated syndrome (THRA), and hypothyroidism.

## Function
The THRB gene encodes for the thyroid hormone receptor beta, which is a nuclear receptor that binds to thyroid hormone as its ligand. The receptor is implicated in the regulation of key metabolic processes and development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs1057406, C/T substitution in intron region
- rs41302839, C/T substitution in intron region
- rs750348629, A/T substitution in intron region

## Related Disease
- Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH)
- Thyroid hormone receptor-associated syndrome (THRA)
- Hypothyroidism

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for RTH and THRA involves managing symptoms, as the condition cannot be cured. Hypothyroidism is usually treated by administering synthetic thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Prognosis for individuals with these conditions varies.

## Drug Response
Individuals with RTH and THRA may have reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The drug response varies depending on the underlying condition.
