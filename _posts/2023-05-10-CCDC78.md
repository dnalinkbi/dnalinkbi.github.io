# CCDC78 Gene Information

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
The CCDC78 gene (coiled-coil domain containing 78) is located on chromosome 2 at position 2q31.1. The function of this gene is not well understood, but it is believed to play a role in cellular signaling and possibly in the development of the nervous system.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 34182
- NCBI Entrez ID: 84210
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163081
- OMIM ID: 615420
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q86T25
- Aliases: DCAMKL2, LUCA-15

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the CCDC78 gene, including missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and nonsense mutations. The following is a list of some of the missense mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| p.Leu54Pro | Missense | rs148923857 |
| p.Arg262Trp | Missense | rs150476038 |
| p.Arg405Cys | Missense | rs142575325 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the CCDC78 gene listed in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
There is limited information on the association between CCDC78 and disease. However, a study has shown that a variant in CCDC78 is associated with susceptibility to end-stage renal disease in some Chinese populations.

## Treatment and Prognosis
As the function of CCDC78 is not well understood, there is no targeted treatment for any potential conditions associated with its dysregulation. Prognosis for any related conditions is unknown.

## Drug Response
Currently, there is no known drug response specific to CCDC78.
