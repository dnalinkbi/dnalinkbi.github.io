# Gene LFNG

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q32.1)
- **Function:** This gene encodes a protein involved in the synthesis of a group of proteins called the Notch signaling pathway. These proteins regulate cell differentiation and growth during development.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 6654
    - NCBI Entrez: 4015
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000128604
    - OMIM: 602576
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6A4
- **Aliases:** Drosophila lunatic fringe homolog, beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase LFNG

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are several known mutations in LFNG that have been associated with human diseases. These include:
    - p.Gly253Serfs*13
    - p.Gln244Ter
    - p.Arg391Trp
- **Mutation Type:** Frameshift, Nonsense, Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs1554128890, rs1554130297, rs1554131139

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in LFNG have been associated with several developmental disorders, including:
    - Spondylocostal dysostosis 3, autosomal recessive (SCDO3)
    - Alagille syndrome 3 (ALGS3)
    - Adams-Oliver syndrome 5 (AOS5)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis for LFNG-related disorders vary depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. However, supportive therapies such as physical therapy and surgery may be beneficial in the management of some symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information available on the drug response of LFNG-related disorders.
