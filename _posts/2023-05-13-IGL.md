## Information about gene IGL

IGL is a gene that encodes for the immunoglobulin lambda light chain. It is located on the chromosome 22 at the position 22q11.22. The gene is expressed in B-cell lymphocytes and is involved in the humoral immune response.

### Function for gene
The IGL gene encodes the immunoglobulin lambda light chain which is a component of the antibody molecules. It is involved in the humoral immune response and helps to protect the body against foreign substances.
