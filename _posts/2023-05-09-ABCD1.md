# Gene ABCD1

## Genetic Position
The ABCD1 gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xq28.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ABCD1 gene are associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). ALD is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands.

## Function
The ABCD1 gene encodes a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein called ALDP. This protein is responsible for transporting very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into the peroxisome for degradation. Mutations in this gene cause a buildup of VLCFAs, which leads to the symptoms of ALD.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala337Val (missense) - rs4147917
- p.Ala382Val (missense) - rs4147916

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported for the ABCD1 gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for ALD, but treatment options can help manage symptoms and slow down disease progression. These treatments may include medications, dietary changes, hormone replacement therapy, and stem cell transplantation. The prognosis of ALD can vary depending on the type and severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There are no known drug responses specific to mutations in the ABCD1 gene.
