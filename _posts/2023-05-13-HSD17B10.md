## Gene HSD17B10

The HSD17B10 gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and encodes for a multifunctional enzyme, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 10 (HSD10). 

### Function
The HSD10 enzyme acts as a homodimer and plays a key role in several biological pathways. It functions in the metabolism of steroids, prostaglandins, and fatty acids, and also plays a role in energy production by acting as a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported so far.

### Related Disease
Defects in the HSD17B10 gene are associated with various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, X-linked intellectual disability, and mental retardation. Mutations in the HSD10 gene are also associated with Progressive Infantile Poliodystrophy (PIPD) and 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD) deficiency.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for HSD10-related diseases. Treatment options include symptomatic and supportive care that may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and medications to manage seizures and other symptoms.

### Drug Response
There are no specific drugs available for the treatment of HSD10-related diseases.
