# Gene: PRPF40B

## Genetic Position 
- **Gene ID**: 25691
- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 20: 34,025,121-34,053,967
- **Aliases**: PRP40 pre-mRNA processing factor 40 homolog B (yeast), pACT,  RP11-406D17.3

## Function of Gene
The PRPF40B gene encodes for the pre-mRNA-processing factor pACT, which is a component of the spliceosome complex involved in the splicing of pre-mRNAs. Additionally, the pACT protein also functions as an adapter molecule in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and plays a role in DNA double-strand break repair.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the PRPF40B gene have been linked with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), an inherited eye disease that leads to progressive vision loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for RP. However, some treatments may help slow the progression of the disease and manage its symptoms, such as vision aids, gene therapy, and retinal implants. The prognosis for RP varies depending on the individual and the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs that target the PRPF40B gene specifically. However, some drugs that have been approved for other diseases, such as the FDA-approved drug Voretigene Neparvovec, may be effective in treating RP caused by mutations in this gene.
