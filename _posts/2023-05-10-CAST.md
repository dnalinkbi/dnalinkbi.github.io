# Gene: CAST

## Information
- Function: The CAST gene encodes a protein known as calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease implicated in cell signaling, apoptosis, and other cellular processes.
- External IDs:
    - Gene ID: 834
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 5: 47,149,663-47,306,926
    - Aliases: CAF, CPSTN, FLJ26167

## External Sites
- HGNC: 1991
- NCBI Entrez: 834
- Ensembl: ENSG00000145916
- OMIM: 114182
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P20810

## Variants
- AA Mutation List:
    - No pathogenic mutations have been reported
- Somatic SNVs/InDels:
    - None reported

## Related Disease
- Alzheimer's Disease: Several studies have shown that CAST levels are decreased in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that calpastatin may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no targeted treatment for CAST-related disorders, as no pathogenic mutations have been identified in the gene. However, studies are ongoing to further elucidate the role of calpastatin in disease pathogenesis and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

## Drug Response
- No drug response information available.
