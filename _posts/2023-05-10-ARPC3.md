# Gene Information

## ARPC3 gene

- Function: The ARPC3 gene encodes a protein subunit of the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex, which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization and cytoskeleton organization.
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17q12
- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 710
    - NCBI Entrez: 10094
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000005206
    - OMIM: 604223
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15143
- Aliases: p21-ARC, ARC20, ARC3, ARC18

## AA mutations

- No AA mutations reported.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- No somatic SNVs/InDels reported.

## Related diseases

- ARPC3 mutations have been linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and incurable lung disease characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.

## Treatment and prognosis

- There is no cure for pulmonary fibrosis, but treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms and slowing disease progression. Options include oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and medication to suppress the immune system.
- Prognosis varies widely depending on factors such as age, disease severity, and overall health. In some cases, lung transplant may be necessary.

## Drug response

- No information available on drug response related to ARPC3 mutations.
