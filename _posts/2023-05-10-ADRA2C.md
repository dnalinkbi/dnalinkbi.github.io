## Gene Information for ADRA2C

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Gene Symbol:** ADRA2C
- **Chromosome:** 4
- **Locus:** p16.3
- **Pathology:** The ADRA2C gene has been associated with several diseases, including vascular dementia, bipolar disorder, and hypertension.

### Function
- The ADRA2C gene encodes for a member of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor family, which plays a role in regulating the central and peripheral nervous systems and modulating neurotransmitter release.

### External IDs and Aliases
- **HGNC ID:** 290
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 151
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000138685
- **OMIM ID:** 104221
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P18825
- **Aliases:** ADRA2, Alpha-2C adrenoceptor

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No known mutations in the ADRA2C gene have been associated with disease.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic SNVs or InDels in the ADRA2C gene have been associated with disease.

### Related Disease
- **Vascular Dementia:** The ADRA2C gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia by regulating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and modulating cerebral blood flow.
- **Bipolar Disorder:** The ADRA2C gene has been associated with bipolar disorder, a psychiatric disorder characterized by episodes of mania and depression.
- **Hypertension:** The ADRA2C gene has been linked to hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure that increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for diseases associated with the ADRA2C gene vary depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms. Management strategies may include medications, lifestyle changes, and therapies aimed at addressing the underlying cause of the disease.
- The prognosis for patients with diseases associated with the ADRA2C gene also depends on the specific condition and the effectiveness of treatment measures.

### Drug Response
- The ADRA2C gene may play a role in drug response for certain medications that target the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor family.
