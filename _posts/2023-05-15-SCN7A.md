# Gene Information for SCN7A

## Gene function
The SCN7A gene encodes for a voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, which is expressed in sensory neurons. It plays a crucial role in pain sensation.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 10587
- NCBI Entrez: 6331
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171862
- OMIM: 600702
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q11M66

The genomic location of SCN7A is on chromosome 2q24.3.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg185Gly - Missense Variant - rs199835760
- p.Ile848Thr - Missense Variant - rs886042234
- p.Ala863Val - Missense Variant - rs191207896
- p.Ala1007Pro - Missense Variant - rs1064794432

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no records of somatic SNVs/InDels for SCN7A in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
SCN7A is associated with the following diseases: 
- Congenital insensitivity to pain
- Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder
- Erythromelalgia
- Febrile seizures

## Treatment and Prognosis 
There is no definitive treatment for SCN7A-associated pain disorders. However, several pharmacological treatments such as opioids, antiepileptics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used to alleviate symptoms.

## Drug Response 
Studies have shown that SCN7A gene mutations can influence the response of patients to various drugs such as carbamazepine and lidocaine.
