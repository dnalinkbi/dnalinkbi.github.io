# Gene NDUFS5

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic position and Aliases:** NDUFS5 is located on chromosome 2q33.1 and has the aliases of B18, CI-75K, and NDUFV2.

**Function for gene:** NDUFS5 encodes a protein subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is the largest respiratory chain complex. Complex I is involved in oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which energy is produced in cells. NDUFS5 plays a vital role in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a critical step in this process.

**External IDs and sites:**
- HGNC: 7763
- NCBI Entrez: 4710
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115380
- OMIM: 603846
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00217

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Several mutations have been identified in the NDUFS5 gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Some of the reported mutations with their dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation Type | AA mutation | dbSNP ID |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Missense      | p.Arg67His | rs398123636 |
| Missense      | p.Arg96Gln | rs149401266 |
| Nonsense      | p.Gln41Ter | rs121909678 |
| Frameshift    | p.Ile103Argfs*7 | rs786205378 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the NDUFS5 gene. Some of these are:

| AA Mutation | dbSNP ID | Disease |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| p.Pro10Leu | rs1057518808 | Bladder cancer |
| p.Ala13Pro | rs369426122 | Struma Ovarii |
| p.Thr87Ile | rs1801619071 | Colorectal cancer |

**Related disease:** Mutations in the NDUFS5 gene have been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of mental and physical abilities. 
Additionally, mutations in NDUFS5 have been implicated in other mitochondrial diseases, including encephalomyopathy and cardiomyopathy.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for Leigh syndrome, and treatment is mainly supportive. Supplements such as thiamine and riboflavin have been used with limited success. Patients with Leigh syndrome may have a shortened lifespan, and their prognosis depends on the severity of their symptoms.

**Drug response:** Currently, there is no specific drug available for treating Leigh syndrome caused by NDUFS5 mutations. However, some symptomatic treatments, such as L-dopa, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin B3, have been reported to have some clinical benefits.
