## Gene Information for MYT1 

- **Function:** MYT1 encodes for a protein that belongs to the myelin transcription factor 1 family. This protein plays a crucial role in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, which are the cells in the central nervous system that produce myelin. 

- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 4642 
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 20: 51,648,721-51,704,494
