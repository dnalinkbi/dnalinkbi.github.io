# Gene: IKBKAP

## Information

- **Function:** Encodes for inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IÎ±I) which is involved in various biological processes including inflammation, blood coagulation, and immune response.

- **External IDs and Location:** 
    - HGNC: 5268
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000104320
    - NCBI Entrez: 8518
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 9q31.3

- **Aliases:** 
    - ELP1
    - IKAP
    - KIAA0457

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| c.2204G>A | Missense | rs200954719 |
| c.710+6T>G | Splice Site | rs61752561 |
| c.470+6T>C | Splice Site | rs61752562 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

- **Related Disease:** Familial dysautonomia (FD), also known as Riley-Day syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the IKBKAP gene. FD patients display symptoms such as sensory and autonomic dysfunction, cardiovascular instability, and hypertensive crisis.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for FD, and treatment aims to manage symptoms. Prognosis is poor, with most patients dying by the age of 40.

- **Drug Response:** The FDA has recently approved a drug called 'FD drug', which is a phosphoramidon-based compound that increases IKBKAP mRNA levels. In clinical trials, FD patients showed an increase in autonomic function, but further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of this treatment.
