## Gene LETM1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4, from base pair position 76,566,974 to 76,600,742

**Pathology:** LETM1 mutations are associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, intellectual disability, and developmental delay.

**Function:** LETM1 encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a role in the transport of ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane, regulating mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, and maintaining mitochondrial morphology.
