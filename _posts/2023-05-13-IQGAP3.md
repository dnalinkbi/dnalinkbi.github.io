## Information on Gene IQGAP3

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position**: IQGAP3 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p34.1.
- **Pathology**: There is limited information available on disease association with the IQGAP3 gene.
- **Function**: The IQGAP3 gene encodes a member of the IQGAP family of scaffold proteins that play a role in cell signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and adhesion. IQGAP3 is specifically expressed in the human brain and may be involved in neural development and function.
