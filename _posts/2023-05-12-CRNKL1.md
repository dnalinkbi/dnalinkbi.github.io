# Gene CRNKL1

## Description
The CRNKL1 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2 and encodes for the protein CRK-like protein 1. It has been associated with several diseases, including cancer, developmental disorders, and other conditions.

## Function
The protein encoded by CRNKL1 plays a role in cell signaling and migration, as well as in the regulation of the cytoskeleton.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC: 19179
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 84180
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000108948
- OMIM ID: 613243
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8IXZ7

Aliases include CRK7, TENC1, and FLJ10813.

## Mutations
Several mutations have been identified in the CRNKL1 gene, including missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations. Some of these mutations have been associated with cancer and developmental disorders, while others are of unknown significance.

### AA mutations with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg226Cys (rs746272324)
- p.Leu167Phe (rs767368105)
- p.Ser180Leu (rs765596054)

## Related Diseases
Mutations in CRNKL1 have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Colorectal cancer
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- Parkinson's disease
- Developmental disorders such as autism and intellectual disability

## Treatment and Prognosis
There currently exists no specific treatment or cure for diseases caused by mutations in CRNKL1. However, targeted therapies and personalized medicine may be effective in some cases, and gene therapy remains a promising avenue for future research.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response related to mutations in CRNKL1.
