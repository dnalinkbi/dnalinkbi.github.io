## Mutations and Variations

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Several AA mutations have been reported in HAPLN1 gene:
- p.Gly410Glu with dbSNP ID: rs764819988
- p.Asp228Ala with dbSNP ID: rs145986880

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

## Related Diseases

Mutations in HAPLN1 gene are associated with Osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects the hips, knees, and hands.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for OA and treatment is focused on relieving pain and improving joint function. Non-surgical treatment options include physical therapy, exercise, weight loss, and medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. In severe cases, surgical options include joint replacements. 

The prognosis for patients with OA varies depending on the severity of the disease, age, and overall health. 

## Drug Response

Information about drug response is not available.
