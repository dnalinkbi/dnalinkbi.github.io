# Information about Gene SLC26A2

### Genetic Position
- Gene Name: SLC26A2
- Chromosome location: 5q32
- Genomic location: 136,464,754-136,547,703
- Strand: -
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000164108
- NCBI Entrez ID: 1836
- HGNC ID: 11014

### Pathology and Function
- The SLC26A2 gene encodes a protein called diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter which is involved in the transport of sulfate ions across cell membranes.
- Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene are associated with various skeletal dysplasias including achondrogenesis type 1B, diastrophic dysplasia, and atelosteogenesis type 2.

### External IDs and Aliases
- External ID: SLC26A2
- Aliases: DTDST, DTD, CDTD, CDTDSP, CDPD, SLC26A2B, SLC26A2OS

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID available currently for this gene.

### Related Disease
- Achondrogenesis, type 1B
- Atelosteogenesis, type 2
- Diastrophic dysplasia

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment is mainly symptomatic and involves management of respiratory problems, curvature of the spine, hip dislocation, and joint contractures.
- The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the skeletal dysplasia.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response information available yet for this gene.
