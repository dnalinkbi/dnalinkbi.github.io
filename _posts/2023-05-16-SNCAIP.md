# Gene: SNCAIP

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 5:141,566,949-141,707,249
- **Pathology:** SNCAIP (Synuclein alpha interacting protein) has been found to be associated with Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
- **Function:** SNCAIP is involved in the regulation of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) protein levels and function in the brain. Additionally, it plays a role in the regulation of dopamine release and synaptic transmission.
- **Aliases:** PARK9, NACP-interacting protein, Synphilin-1
