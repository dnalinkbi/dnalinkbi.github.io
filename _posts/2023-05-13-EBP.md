# Gene EBP

## Genetic Position
The EBP gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xq28 and spans about 63.7 kb.

## Pathology
Mutations in the EBP gene have been associated with X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (CDPX2) -- a rare skeletal disorder that affects bone development.

## Function
EBP encodes an enzyme called emopamil-binding protein (EBP). This protein is involved in cholesterol metabolism and is thought to play a key role in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other sterols.

- p.His266Arg (rs104894607)

Most of the mutations reported in the EBP gene are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic mutations reported in the EBP gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the EBP gene have been associated with X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (CDPX2) -- a rare skeletal disorder that affects bone development. Individuals with CDPX2 are born with skeletal abnormalities that lead to short stature and joint deformities.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for CDPX2. Treatment is symptomatic and may involve surgery to correct joint deformities or physical therapy to improve mobility. The prognosis for individuals with CDPX2 varies depending on the severity of the condition and the specific mutations involved.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response for individuals with CDPX2.
