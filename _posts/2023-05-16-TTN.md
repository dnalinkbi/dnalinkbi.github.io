# Information on Gene TTN

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2q31.2

**Function for Gene:** TTN (Titin) encodes for a protein called Titin, which is the largest known protein in humans. It plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and elasticity by connecting the Z-disks of striated muscle sarcomeres.

**Pathology:** Mutations in TTN have been associated with various types of cardiomyopathy, including dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, as well as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 12403
- NCBI Entrez: 7273
- Ensembl: ENSG00000155657
- OMIM: 188840
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8WZ42

**Aliases:** TITIN, CMD1G, CMPD4

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg9677Ter (rs397514528)
- p.Gln4295Ter (rs137853127)
- p.Ser2484Ter (rs397514534)
- p.Arg3265Cys (rs35235464)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs34324140
- rs372907374
- rs151137313
- rs104894074

**Related Disease:** Cardiomyopathy (dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options vary depending on the type and severity of cardiomyopathy. They may include medication, surgery, pacemakers or implantable defibrillators, and lifestyle changes. The prognosis is also variable and depends on the individual case.

**Drug Response:** Currently, there are no drugs specific to mutations in TTN. However, certain medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or control the underlying condition.
