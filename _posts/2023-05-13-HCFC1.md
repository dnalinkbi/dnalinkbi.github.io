# Information about Gene HCFC1

## Summary
Gene HCFC1 (host cell factor C1) is located on chromosome Xq28 and codes for a transcriptional coactivator that plays an important role in gene regulation. It is also known by the aliases HCF-1 and VCAF.

## Function
HCFC1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator by interacting with multiple transcription factors, including Sp1 and Oct-1, and recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to regulate gene expression. It is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including differentiation, cell cycle control, and DNA replication and repair.
