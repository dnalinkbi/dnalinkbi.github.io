# Information about gene CYP4F2

## Genetic Position
CYP4F2 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

## Pathology
CYP4F2 gene is associated with different diseases, such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, hypertension and coronary heart disease.

## Function for gene
CYP4F2 gene encodes for a member of cytochrome P450 proteins which are responsible for the metabolism of a variety of compounds, including drugs, fatty acids, and steroid hormones.
