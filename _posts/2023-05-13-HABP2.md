# Information about Gene HABP2
## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: HABP2 (hyaluronan binding protein 2)
- Chromosome: 10q25.3
- Pathology: HABP2 is associated with increased risk of thrombosis and stroke due to its involvement in blood coagulation. It has also been implicated in prostate cancer progression and metastasis. 

## Function 
HABP2 encodes a serine protease that plays a role in the regulation of blood coagulation and cell adhesion. It is also involved in the processing of growth factors and regulation of cell signaling pathways.

## Related Diseases
- Increased risk of thrombosis and stroke
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for HABP2-related thrombosis and stroke involves the use of anticoagulants and other medications to prevent blood clots.
- The prognosis for individuals with HABP2-related thrombosis and stroke depends on various factors, including their age, overall health, and the severity of their condition.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug response associated specifically with HABP2.
