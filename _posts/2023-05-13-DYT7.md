## Gene: DYT7 

### Function
The DYT7 gene encodes for the protein Torsin-A, which is a member of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. Torsin-A is involved in intracellular trafficking, nuclear envelope dynamics, and response to cellular stress.

### Related disease
DYT7 is associated with a rare form of dystonia, which is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Specifically, this type of dystonia is generalized and onset in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood, with a tendency for the symptoms to progress. 

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for DYT7-associated dystonia. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and may include physical therapy, medications, and surgery. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and their response to treatment.

### Drug response
There is limited information available regarding the drug response for DYT7-associated dystonia. However, several medications have been used to manage dystonia symptoms, including anticholinergics, baclofen, and botulinum toxin injections.
