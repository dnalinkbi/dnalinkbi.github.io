## Gene MN1 

### Genetic Position
MN1 gene is located at 22q13.2 position in chromosome 22. 

### Pathology
MN1 is considered as an oncogene and is involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MN1 plays a crucial role in leukemogenesis by inhibiting apoptosis, regulating cell proliferation, and promoting self-renewal of leukemic stem cells.

### Function
MN1 (meningioma 1) protein functions as a transcriptional coactivator and is known to play a critical role in the development of the cranial meninges, which is the protective membrane surrounding the brain and the spinal cord. MN1 protein is also involved in the development of other organs such as the heart, lung, and kidney.

### Related Disease
MN1 gene is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MN1 overexpression is seen in around 10-15% of patients with AML and is linked to the presence of a FLT3-ITD mutation.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The MN1 gene is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AML. Targeted therapies are being developed to inhibit MN1 expression, which could help in treating AML patients with MN1 overexpression. MN1 expression is also being used as a prognostic marker for AML patients, with high expression levels indicating a poor prognosis.

### Drug Response
Leukemic stem cells with MN1 overexpression have been shown to be sensitive to DNMT inhibitors such as decitabine, providing a potential treatment option for AML patients with MN1 overexpression.
