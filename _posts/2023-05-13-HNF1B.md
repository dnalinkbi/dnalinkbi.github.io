# Gene information for HNF1B

## Genetic Position
- The HNF1B gene is located on chromosome 17q12.

## Pathology
- Mutations in the HNF1B gene are associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancers including liver, pancreatic, and renal cancers. 
- Additionally, mutations in this gene are associated with a condition called renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD).

## Function
- The HNF1B gene encodes for a transcription factor which plays a crucial role in the formation and development of several organs including the liver, pancreas, and kidneys.

## Related Disease
- RCAD (renal cysts and diabetes syndrome)
- Liver cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Renal cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific condition that is associated with the HNF1B mutation. 
- For RCAD, treatment may involve managing diabetes and addressing complications related to renal cysts.
- For cancers associated with HNF1B mutations, treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy.

## Drug Response
- There is no known specific drug response related to HNF1B mutations at this time.
