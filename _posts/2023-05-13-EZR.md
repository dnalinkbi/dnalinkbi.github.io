# Gene EZR

## Genetic position
The EZR (ezrin) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q25.3), from base pair 153,085,860 to 153,150,310.

## Pathology
EZR mutations have been associated with several types of cancer, including breast, lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer. Additionally, EZR mutations have been implicated in the progression of various cancers, as well as metastasis.

## Function for gene
The EZR gene codes for a protein known as ezrin, which serves as a component of the cytoskeleton and plays a critical role in cell adhesion, motility, and signaling. Ezrin acts as a bridge between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating the formation and maintenance of cellular structures such as microvilli.

## Treatment and prognosis
EZR mutations can be potential targets for development of therapeutic treatments for cancer patients, with several studies examining the effectiveness of targeting EZR in suppressing cancer progression and metastasis. The prognosis of cancer patients with EZR mutations varies depending on the severity of the mutation and the type and stage of the cancer.

## Drug response
There is ongoing research into the use of drugs targeting EZR in treating cancer, with several compounds and therapies currently in clinical trials.
