## Information about Gene RBM20

- **Genetic Position:** RBM20 is the gene located on chromosome 10 in humans. The exact genomic location is 10q25.2.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in RBM20 are associated with various heart diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

- **Function:** RBM20 encodes an RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in the heart and skeletal muscles. It plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle function.

- **External IDs and Aliases:** The external IDs for RBM20 are HGNC:16720, NCBI Entrez: 55209, Ensembl: ENSG00000119950, OMIM: 613171, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q5R1T7. The aliases for this gene are RNA-binding motif protein 20 and Titin-cap.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** RBM20 mutations are associated with heart diseases, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Several amino acid mutations have been found in RBM20, such as p.(Ser637*) and p.(Arg636Cys). These mutations result in a loss or gain of function of the protein, leading to various heart pathologies. There are several dbSNP IDs available for RBM20 mutations.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are somatic variations in RBM20 that have been identified and are associated with heart diseases. Some of the SNVs with dbSNP ID in RBM20 include rs137853343 and rs386833243.

- **Related Disease:** RBM20 mutations are associated with various heart diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for heart diseases associated with RBM20 mutations depends on the type and severity of the condition. Treatment generally includes medications to manage symptoms, lifestyle changes to reduce stress on the heart, and sometimes surgical interventions. The prognosis for RBM20-associated heart diseases is variable depending on the extent and severity of the condition.

- **Drug Response:** The drug response for RBM20-associated heart diseases is variable. However, some medications such as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics are commonly used to manage the symptoms of heart diseases associated with RBM20 mutations.
