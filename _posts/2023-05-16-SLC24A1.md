## Gene: SLC24A1

### Information

SLC24A1 is a gene located on chromosome 15q22.1 which encodes a protein called solute carrier family 24 member 1. This protein is involved in the transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, playing an important role in maintaining the balance of ion concentrations in cells.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some of the known AA mutations for SLC24A1 gene along with their mutation types and dbSNP ID are:

- p.Val443Met (missense) rs794728540
- p.Leu49Val (missense) rs200081300
- p.Ile442Asn (missense) rs147743877

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs (single-nucleotide variants) and InDels (insertions/deletions) associated with SLC24A1 gene in various cancers including lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and ovarian cancer. Some of these mutations with their dbSNP IDs are:

- c.943C>T (substitution) rs372602507
- c.1366G>A (substitution) rs780658508
- c.875C>A (substitution) rs763955620

### Related Disease

Mutations in the SLC24A1 gene have been associated with OCA6 (oculocutaneous albinism type 6), a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence or reduction of melanin pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for OCA6, however, the symptoms can be managed through the use of protective clothing, sunscreen and avoiding sun exposure. Gene therapy is a potential future treatment option.

### Drug Response

There is limited information on drug response associated with SLC24A1 gene.
