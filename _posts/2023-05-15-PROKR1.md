# Analysis of Gene PROKR1 

## Gene Information
- **Gene Function:** The PROKR1 gene encodes a protein called prokineticin receptor 1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes such as angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and inflammation signaling. 

- **Aliases:** Endothelial differentiation G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (EDG1), G-protein coupled receptor 73-like 1, GPR73L1, Prokineticin receptor 1

- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC ID: HGNC:17824
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 10887
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000138144
    - OMIM ID: 607123
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8TCW9

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1q32.1

## Genetic Pathology
- **Related Disease:** Mutations in PROKR1 are associated with Kallmann Syndrome-4 (KAL4) and Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism 8 with or without Anosmia (HH8). These are rare genetic disorders characterized by delayed or absent puberty and an impaired sense of smell.
- **AA Mutation List:**
    - p.Gly31Arg
    - p.Met89Ile
    - p.Thr101Met
    - p.Val331Met

- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations

- **dbSNP ID:** rs138444152, rs61750900, rs1800497, rs1800498

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
   - No known somatic mutations are reported in the COSMIC database.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific diagnosed disorder related to PROKR1 mutations. Treatment options may include hormonal therapies, fertility treatments, and olfactory training for individuals with anosmia.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response specific to PROKR1 mutations. However, prokineticin receptor agonists and antagonists are currently being investigated as potential therapies for various diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and pain.
