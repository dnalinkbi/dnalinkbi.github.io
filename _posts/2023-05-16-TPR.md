# Information about Gene TPR

## Genetic Position
The TPR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q32.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TPR gene have been associated with various diseases, including:
- Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
- Leukemia 
- Hepatitis C virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function
The TPR gene encodes for a protein called Tetratricopeptide repeat protein, which is involved in the function and assembly of several multi-subunit protein complexes.
