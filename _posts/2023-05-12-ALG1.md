# Gene: ALG1

## Information

### Gene Position

- Chromosome: 16
- Chromosomal Location: 16p13.3

### Pathology

- ALG1 gene mutations can cause a congenital disorder of glycosylation known as ALG1-CDG. 
- This disorder affects the process of protein glycosylation, leading to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and neurological problems.

### Function for Gene

- The ALG1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the early stages of protein glycosylation. 
- Specifically, it is responsible for adding a particular sugar molecule to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.

### Related Diseases

- ALG1-CDG (OMIM: 607143)

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for ALG1-CDG, and treatment is mainly supportive.
- The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response

- No drugs specifically approved for the treatment of ALG1-CDG.
- Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic.
