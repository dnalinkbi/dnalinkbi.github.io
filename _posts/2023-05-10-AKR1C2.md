## Information for Gene AKR1C2

### Genetic Position 
AKR1C2 gene is located on chromosome 10q23.3, from base pair position 90,024,635 to 90,031,723.

### Pathology
The AKR1C2 gene is associated with several pathologies. Its overexpression or differential expression levels have been detected in several cancers including prostate, breast and ovarian cancers, and it is involved in promoting tumor cell growth and invasive behavior.

### Function for Gene
The AKR1C2 gene encodes the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C2 protein, which plays a crucial role in hormone biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism, steroid hormone metabolism, and osmoregulation. It is involved in metabolism of progesterone, 17β-estradiol, testosterone, and the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone, and also plays a role in prostaglandin synthesis.

### Related Disease
AKR1C2 is associated with several diseases including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers as well as endometriosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, no specific treatment targeting AKR1C2 is available. However, several targeted therapies for cancer are in development which may indirectly affect AKR1C2.

### Drug Response
AKR1C2 has been suggested as a predictive biomarker for certain therapies, and inhibition of this gene has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies.
