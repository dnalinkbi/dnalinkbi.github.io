# Gene Information: ACBD6

## Genomic Position and Alias
- Genomic Position: 19q13.33
- Alias: GCP60, ACBD6

## Gene Function
ACBD6 encodes the Golgi resident peripheral membrane protein, which is involved in membrane trafficking and vesicle transport in the Golgi apparatus. ACBD6 has been reported to regulate cell proliferation and motility, and its depletion leads to impaired cytokinesis. 

## External IDs
- HGNC: 22114
- NCBI Entrez: 79064
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130715
- OMIM: 607721
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6ZNE5

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No AA mutation has been reported.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported.

## Related Diseases
- ACBD6 has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis and progression, and its overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for ACBD6-related disease. The prognosis might depend on the stage of colorectal cancer.

## Drug Response
- Currently, there is no drug available that targets ACBD6 directly.
