## Gene Information for IGFALS
- **Function for gene:** The IGFALS gene encodes for insulin-like growth factor-binding protein acid-labile subunit, which is a glycoprotein that binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and plays a crucial role in regulating IGF availability and activity.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 3486
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 16q22.2-q23.1
    - Aliases: ALS, IGFBP-6, IGFBPL1
