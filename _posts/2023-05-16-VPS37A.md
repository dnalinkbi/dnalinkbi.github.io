# Information about gene VPS37A

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- Gene: VPS37A
- Chromosome: 8
- Location: p22
- Pathology: No known genetic disorders associated with mutations in VPS37A.
- Function: VPS37A encodes a protein that is involved in the endosomal sorting required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. This protein is specifically involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into multivesicular bodies for degradation in the lysosome.
