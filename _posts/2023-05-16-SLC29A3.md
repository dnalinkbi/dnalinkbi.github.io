# Information about gene SLC29A3

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The SLC29A3 gene is located on chromosome 6 and is associated with the pathological condition of histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome. It encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as a nucleoside transporter, primarily moving purine or pyrimidine nucleosides from the extracellular space to the intracellular compartment.

## Function for Gene
The SLC29A3 gene is involved in transporting nucleosides, which are essential components of nucleic acids, across the membrane. It plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including DNA synthesis, energy production, and signal transduction.

## External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
External IDs for the SLC29A3 gene include HGNC:18385, NCBI Gene ID: 55307, Ensembl: ENSG00000064557, OMIM: 611037, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BZR8. Its genomic location is 6q21.

## AA mutation list and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several non-synonymous mutations have been identified in the SLC29A3 gene, including missense mutations p.Leu373Phe (rs200819636) and p.Arg358His (rs398122963).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the SLC29A3 gene.

## Related Disease
Genetic mutations in the SLC29A3 gene can cause histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by several features including lymph adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin rash.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments for histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome. Treatment and prognosis depend on the severity of the disease and its symptoms.

## Drug Response
Information about drug response to histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome is limited.
