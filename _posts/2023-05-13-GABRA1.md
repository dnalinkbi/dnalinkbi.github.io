# Gene GABRA1

## Function:
The GABRA1 gene encodes for the alpha-1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor which is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates inhibitory neurotransmission. This receptor affects the perception of anxiety, sedation, and muscle relaxation. 

## External IDs:
- Gene ID: 2554
- Genomic location: Chromosome 5 (NC_000005.10): 161,182,757 - 161,244,576 
- Aliases: ECA11, GABRA, GABRG2

- c.1039_1040delTG (Frameshift variant, dbSNP: rs744397603)

## Related disease:
Mutations in GABRA1 have been linked to various disorders such as Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF), and genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE).

## Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, treatment approaches aim to improve the symptoms associated with the disorder, and there are no available treatment options that target GABRA1 directly. Prognosis mainly depends on the type and severity of the disorder.

## Drug response:
Benzodiazepines are drugs that enhance GABA's activity and are commonly used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and seizures associated with epilepsy. However, the efficacy of benzodiazepines can vary depending on the individual's genetic makeup and types of GABRA1 mutations.
