# Gene Information for BRCC3

## Genetic Position
BRCC3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 at position q31.3.

## Pathology and Function
BRCC3, also known as BRCC36 or KIAA0157, is a member of the BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC) that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and cell cycle progression. It has deubiquitinating activity towards various substrates and participates in the DNA damage response pathway.

## External IDs and Aliases

- NCBI Entrez Gene: 81873
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130823
- OMIM: 610448
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IWZ6

Aliases: BRCC36, KIAA0157

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP IDs
There are several reported missense mutations in BRCC3. Here are some examples:
- c.101G>A (p.Arg34His) rs121918672
- c.242G>A (p.Arg81Gln) rs121918673
- c.284T>C (p.Ile95Thr) rs121918675
- c.478T>C (p.Ile160Thr) rs121918678

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are somatic mutations reported in BRCC3 but without any dbSNP ID associated.

## Related Disease
BRCC3 mutations have been associated with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder that leads to bone marrow failure and a predisposition to cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for Fanconi anemia usually involves bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for individuals with Fanconi anemia can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms and the timely management of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug known to improve the outcome of Fanconi anemia patients with BRCC3 mutations.
