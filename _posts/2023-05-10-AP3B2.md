# Information about gene AP3B2

## Genetic Position and Aliases
- **Gene**: AP3B2 (Adaptor-Related Protein Complex 3 Beta 2 Subunit)
- **Chromosome Location**: 15q25.1
- **Aliases**: ADTB2, BLOC1S4, MGC117246, MGC117247, MGC117248

## Function
AP3B2 encodes a subunit of the AP-3 complex, involved in protein trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes and related organelles. AP-3 is required for recognition of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 by the basolateral sorting receptor. 

## External IDs and Links
- **HGNC**: HGNC:604
- **NCBI Entrez**: 8120
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000070413
- **OMIM**: 602166
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: Q92572

## Variation Information
- **AA Mutation List**: There are numerous variations found on AP3B2, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. For a complete list of mutations, refer to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot or OMIM links above. 

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**: There are currently no somatic mutations reported in the COSMIC database.

## Related Disease
- **Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 2 (HPS2)**: Pathogenic variants in AP3B2 cause Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 2, an autosomal recessive disorder that affects various organs and systems, such as lung fibrosis, albinism, and bleeding disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 2. However, treatment of the symptoms can help improve the quality of life for affected individuals. Lung fibrosis can be treated with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators, while bleeding disorders may require blood transfusions. Regular monitoring for potential complications is also crucial.

## Drug Response
There is currently limited information available on drug response for AP3B2.
