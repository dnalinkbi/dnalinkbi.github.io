## Gene Information

**Gene:** CRELD1

**Function:** Encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a role in embryonic development and is involved in heart formation.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 2513
- NCBI Entrez: 29123
- Ensembl: ENSG00000204305
- OMIM: 608371
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96DU3

**Aliases:** CRTN1, TECRL

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 3q26.31

## Genetic Mutations

**AA Mutation List:**

| AA Position | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 409         | Missense      | rs61744394 (C>T)  |
| 533         | Missense      | rs759253734 (A>G) |
| 546         | Missense      | rs3766405 (C>T)   |
| 893         | Missense      | rs745505636 (T>G) |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

There are no known somatic mutations for CRELD1 in cancer.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in CRELD1 have been linked to Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). Specifically, mutations in this gene have been shown to cause Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD), a heart condition that impacts blood flow between the chambers of the heart.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for Congenital Heart Disease varies depending on the severity of the condition. In many cases, surgery may be required to correct structural abnormalities in the heart. Prognosis also varies, but with appropriate treatment individuals with CHD can live long and healthy lives.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available regarding drug response for mutations in CRELD1.
