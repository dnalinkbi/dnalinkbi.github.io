# Information about Gene KIF11

## Genetic Position
Gene KIF11 is located on chromosome #10 at position q23.33.

## Pathology and Function
The KIF11 gene encodes a kinesin-like protein called Eg5 that plays a crucial role in mitotic spindle assembly and cell division. Aberrant expression or mutation of KIF11 can cause chromosomal instability leading to various cancers.

## Related Disease
KIF11 mutations have been associated with various cancers, including breast, prostate, and lung cancers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
KIF11 inhibitors have shown promising results as anticancer agents in preclinical studies. However, further clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs.

## Drug Response
Several KIF11 inhibitors are under development, including S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), ispinesib, and filanesib. STLC has been shown to be effective against multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.
