## Gene MTR

### Information

- The gene MTR is located on chromosome 1 at genomic position 1q43.
- The MTR gene encodes the enzyme methionine synthase.
- External IDs for MTR are:
    - HGNC: 7454
    - NCBI Entrez: 4548
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000132639
    - OMIM: 156570
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P42898
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.2756A>G (p.Asn919Ser), rs1805087
    - c.2365A>G (p.His789Arg), rs3737967
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - c.371A>G (p.Lys124Arg), rs143184522
- Pathology: Mutations in MTR are associated with several diseases, including neural tube defects, homocystinuria, and methylcobalamin deficiency.
- Function: The methionine synthase enzyme plays a critical role in the synthesis of methionine, an essential amino acid. Methionine is required for the production of S-adenosylmethionine, which is involved in the methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins.
- Related disease: Defects in the MTR gene are associated with methylcobalamin deficiency, which can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and neurologic abnormalities.
- Treatment and prognosis: Methylcobalamin supplementation can alleviate symptoms of methylcobalamin deficiency and lower homocysteine levels. However, severe neurologic damage may not be reversible.
- Drug response: There is limited evidence on drug response in MTR mutations.
