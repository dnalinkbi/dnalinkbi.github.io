## Gene PVRL1

### Genetic Position
PVRL1 gene is located on human chromosome 11q23.3.

### Pathology
PVRL1 gene is associated with a variety of diseases including cancer, cleft lip and palate, and infectious diseases.

### Function
PVRL1 gene encodes a member of the nectin family, which are cell adhesion molecules involved in the formation of adherens junctions in epithelial cells. The encoded protein plays a role in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion and is involved in the organization of epithelial apical junction complexes.
