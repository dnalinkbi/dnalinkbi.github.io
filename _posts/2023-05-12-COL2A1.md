# Information about gene COL2A1

## Genetic Position
The gene COL2A1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13.11).

## Pathology
Mutations in the COL2A1 gene can cause various skeletal disorders, including achondrogenesis type II, Kniest dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, and Stickler syndrome type I.

## Function
COL2A1 provides instructions for making type II collagen, which is a major component of cartilage, bone, and other tissues. Type II collagen helps provide strength and structure to these tissues.
