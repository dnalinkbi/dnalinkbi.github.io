# Gene PTGS2

## Information

**Genetic Position**: The PTGS2 gene is located on chromosome 1, specifically on the long (q) arm at position 25.2.

**Pathology**: PTGS2 has been associated with inflammation, pain, and cancer.

**Function**: The PTGS2 gene encodes for the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which plays a key role in the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in inflammation and pain.

## Related Disease

Diseases associated with PTGS2 mutations:

- Colorectal cancer
- Breast cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Alzheimer's disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis

## Treatment and Prognosis

Some drugs that target COX-2, such as celecoxib, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of pain and inflammation. However, their use may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, so caution is advised.

## Drug Response

Genetic variants in PTGS2 have been found to affect drug response to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
