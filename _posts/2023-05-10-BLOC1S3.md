## Gene: BLOC1S3

### Information

- Genetic position: Chromosome 19: 6,049,528-6,084,886
- Pathology: BLOC1S3 is associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and in some cases, pulmonary fibrosis.
- Function: BLOC1S3 is a component of BLOC-1, a protein complex involved in the biogenesis and cargo trafficking of lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID associated with BLOC1S3.

### Related Disease

BLOC1S3 mutations are primarily associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by bleeding diathesis, oculocutaneous albinism, and in some cases, pulmonary fibrosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Treatment options are aimed at managing the symptoms of the condition such as bleeding and vision problems. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the symptoms, but generally, individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome have a shortened lifespan due to complications from the condition.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug response associated with BLOC1S3 mutations.
