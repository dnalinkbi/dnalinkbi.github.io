## Gene TFAP2B

- Function: TFAP2B (Transcription Factor AP-2 Beta) gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor, regulating expression of genes involved in the development and differentiation of multiple organs and tissues, including neural crest-derived structures, melanocytes, heart, and kidneys.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  
  None reported yet.
  
- Related disease: 

  * Branchiooculofacial Syndrome (BOFS)
  
- Treatment and prognosis: 

  There is currently no cure for BOFS and treatment is mainly symptomatic, based on the patientâ€™s clinical features. Individuals with highly variable clinical expressions may require a multidisciplinary approach, including ophthalmologic evaluations, hearing test, renal function evaluation, and cardiological assessment. 
  
- Drug response: 

  Currently, there is no targeted drug therapy for BOFS.
