### Function for gene

EPOR is a gene that encodes the erythropoietin receptor, which is expressed on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells and is critical for erythropoiesis, or the process of red blood cell production. The erythropoietin receptor binds to erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates erythrocyte (red blood cell) production in response to hypoxia.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

EPOR mutations that are associated with disease are rare and predominantly result in loss-of-function mutations in the erythropoietin receptor. A list of some of the known mutations and their dbSNP IDs is provided below:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Pro555Leu | Missense | rs2228059 |
| p.Ala439Thr | Missense | rs151319749 |
| p.Leu134Gln | Missense | rs555918898 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in the EPOR gene are rare, and the majority of mutations are germline. Therefore, there is limited information on somatic mutations in the EPOR gene.

### Related disease

Mutations in the EPOR gene are associated with a rare form of erythrocytosis called primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP), which is inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern. In addition, some studies suggest that dysregulation of EPOR signaling may play a role in the pathogenesis of some forms of myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for PFCP is focused on reducing erythrocyte production through phlebotomy or medication. In addition, patients may benefit from low-dose aspirin treatment to reduce their risk of thrombotic complications. The overall prognosis for individuals with PFCP is good with appropriate treatment.

### Drug response

Some studies suggest that certain EPOR mutations may confer resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as recombinant erythropoietin and darbepoetin alfa.
