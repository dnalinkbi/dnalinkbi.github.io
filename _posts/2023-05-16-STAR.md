# Gene: STAR

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location:
The STAR gene is located on chromosome 8 at the position 8p11.23. The genomic location of the gene is NC_000008.11.

## Pathology:
Mutations in the STAR gene are associated with steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) deficiency. This is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in reduced production of steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, leading to a condition known as congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia.

## Function:
The STAR gene encodes the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) which is involved in the transfer of cholesterol to the inner membrane of mitochondria in steroidogenic cells. This is the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone synthesis.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000136056
- OMIM: 600617
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49675
- Aliases: STARD1, STARD3

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- c.571C>T (p.Arg191Ter) - rs121912748
- c.697C>T (p.Arg233Ter) - rs121912749
- c.258G>C (p.Ala86Pro) - rs200299872

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no records of somatic SNVs/InDels in the STAR gene.

## Related Disease:
Mutations in the STAR gene are associated with steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) deficiency which leads to congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment for StAR deficiency usually involves hormone replacement therapy to supplement the deficient hormones. With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, patients can lead normal lives.

## Drug Response:
There are no drug response records for the STAR gene.
