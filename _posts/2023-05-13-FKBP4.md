## Information on Gene FKBP4 

### Gene and Genomic Location

- **Gene:** FKBP4
- **Aliases:** FKBP52, FKBP59, FKBP4A
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 12q13.33

### Function of Gene

The FKBP4 gene encodes for the protein FKBP52 which is a member of the immunophilin protein family. It interacts with several intracellular signaling pathways, including steroid hormone receptor signaling, and may play a role in protein folding and trafficking. FKBP52 also plays a role in regulating the cellular response to various stresses and may be implicated in cancer progression.

### External IDs

- **HGNC ID:** 3770
- **NCBI Entrez:** 2289
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000111245
- **OMIM ID:** 602623
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P30679

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid (AA) substitutions/mutations present in the FKBP4 gene that have been identified in the dbSNP database. Some of these mutations, with dbSNP ID, are:

- p.P268S (rs116363065)
- p.T497M (rs150714525)
- p.T369A (rs150614279)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variations)/InDels (Insertions and Deletions) with dbSNP ID have also been identified in the FKBP4 gene. Some of these include:

- rs3742658
- rs769074191
- rs9832762

### Related Disease

The FKBP4 gene has been implicated in several diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. FKBP52 is known to interact with tau protein, which is involved in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease pathology.

### Treatment and Prognosis

The implications for treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and mutation involved. However, targeting FKBP52 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for certain diseases and cancer.

### Drug Response

Several studies have investigated the drug response of FKBP52 and its potential as a drug target. For example, the FKBP52 inhibitor N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA) has been shown to have anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo.
