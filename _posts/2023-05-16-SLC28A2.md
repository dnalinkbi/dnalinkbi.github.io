# Gene SLC28A2

## Gene Information

**Function:** Solute carrier family 28 member 2 (SLC28A2) is a transmembrane protein that acts as a concentrative nucleoside transporter. It is primarily expressed in the kidneys and plays a role in the reabsorption of uridine in the kidney proximal tubule. 

**External IDs:** 
- Gene ID: 9156
- Genomic location: Chromosome 15q13.1
- Aliases: CNT2, FLJ14866, MGC104643

**External Sites:**
- HGNC: 11013
- NCBI Entrez: 9156
- Ensembl: ENSG00000165831
- OMIM: 606025
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H251

## Mutations and Variations

**AA Mutation List:**
The SLC28A2 gene has several missense mutations, silent mutations, and small frameshift deletions that have been identified. These mutations affect the structure and function of the protein. Some of the common mutations with their dbSNP IDs are listed below:

| Mutation Type | AA Change | dbSNP ID |
| :------------ | :------- | :------- |
| Missense      | E33K     | rs498703319 |
| Missense      | L92P     | rs121909771 |
| Missense      | G103R    | rs121909772 |
| Missense      | L170I    | rs150120277 |
| Missense      | W231C    | rs121909773 |
| Frameshift    | p.Glu82fs| rs796052083 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
There are multiple reports of somatic SNVs/InDels in the SLC28A2 gene that have been identified in various types of cancer. Some of the common somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs are listed below:

|Mutation Type|AA Change|dbSNP ID|Cancer Type|
|:-----------|:--------|:-------|:----------|
|Missense|L92P|rs121909771|Colorectal Cancer|
|Missense|W231C|rs121909773|Bladder Cancer|
|Missense|V241I|rs200975464|Esophageal Cancer|

## Related Diseases

Studies have shown that mutations in the SLC28A2 gene are associated with the development of different types of cancer, including:
- Colorectal cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Ovarian cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no definitive cure for cancer caused by mutations in the SLC28A2 gene. Treatment generally involves surgery to remove the cancerous tissue followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis of the disease depends on various factors such as cancer stage, patient's age, and overall health.

## Drug Response

There is a lack of clinical trials investigating the drug response of SLC28A2-associated cancer. However, databases suggest that certain chemotherapy drugs such as 5-Fluorouracil and Gemcitabine may be effective in treating cancers associated with this gene.
