# Gene MERTK

## Information

### Gene Position
- Chromosomal location: 2q14.1
- Base pairs (GRCh38): 110,104,594 - 110,134,123

### Pathology
MERTK mutations are associated with a variety of pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and retinal degeneration.

### Function
MERTK is involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which is a critical process in tissue remodeling and maintaining homeostasis. It is also involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7028
- NCBI Entrez: 10461
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115085
- OMIM: 604705
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q12866
- Aliases: Mer, c-Eyk, c-mer

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Some of the amino acid (AA) mutations that have been reported for MERTK are:
- G160D (rs61746007)
- V378I (rs138490187)
- Y551C (rs149053190)
- G888C (rs112661885)
- S969F (rs56203823)

The mutation types can be missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.1469G>A (rs782378174)
- c.2605-401C>T (rs541093358)
- c.3055G>A (rs143119674)

### Related Diseases
MERTK mutations are related to a number of diseases including:
- Retinitis pigmentosa
- Cancer, such as breast cancer, leukemia, and melanoma
- Autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for MERTK mutations. However, different approaches are being investigated to target the MERTK pathway in cancer therapy. The prognosis depends on the specific pathology and the individual case.

### Drug Response
There are several drugs that target MERTK such as BGB324 and UNC2025. However, their efficacy is being tested in different clinical trials.
