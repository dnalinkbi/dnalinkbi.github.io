# Gene: HSD17B3

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: X
- Genomic Position:  Xq11.2
- Locus: 81931-82851 bp
- Strand: Forward

## Pathology
HSD17B3 is associated with different pathological conditions:
- type 4 46,XY disorder of sex development (DSD)
- male infertility
- androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
- hypospadias

## Function for Gene
HSD17B3 gene encodes an enzyme called 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD3) that is involved in testosterone production. This enzyme is responsible for converting the weak androgen, androstenedione, into testosterone, the primary male sex hormone.

- rs28399504
- rs28599126
- rs35114632

## Related Disease
HSD17B3 gene is associated with the following diseases:
- 46, XY confusion of sex development (DSD)
- Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
- Hypospadias

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of the diseases associated with HSD17B3 gene depend on the severity of the disease and the age at which it is diagnosed. In general, hormone replacement therapy is used to replace the deficient hormone in affected individuals.

## Drug response
There is limited knowledge about the drug response for genetic changes in HSD17B3 gene. However, some studies suggest that the enzyme activity of HSD17B3 can be inhibited by certain drugs that target the androgen receptor.
