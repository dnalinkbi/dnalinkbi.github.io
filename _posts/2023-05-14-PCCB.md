# Information on Gene PCCB

## Gene Description

- **Name:** Propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta chain (PCCB)
- **Function:** PCCB encodes for a subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) which is required for catabolism of odd-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and other metabolites via the propionic acidemia pathway. PCC is also important for gluconeogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and ketogenesis.
- **Aliases:** PCC-beta, PCCA2, PCCB-D2S135, Propionyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase beta chain

## External IDs

- **HGNC:** 8783
- **NCBI Entrez:** 5096
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000101250
- **OMIM:** 232050
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P05166

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List:** A list of all AA mutations can be found on the [PCCB page]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5096/)) on NCBI Gene.
- **Mutation Type:** The mutations reported include missense mutations, frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations.
- **dbSNP ID:** The dbSNP IDs for reported mutations can also be found on the NCBI Gene page.

## Somatic Mutations

- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for PCCB.

## Related Disease

- **Disease Name:** Propionic acidemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of propionate metabolism caused by a deficiency of PCC.
- **Symptoms:** Symptoms of propionic acidemia include vomiting, lethargy, poor feeding, developmental delay, seizures, and coma.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment involves managing symptoms, reducing toxic metabolites, and preventing catabolism through dietary and supplement restrictions. Long-term prognosis is associated with age at disease onset and quality of treatment.
- **Drug Response:** No drug response information for PCCB is reported in the literature.
