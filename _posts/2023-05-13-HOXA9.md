# HOXA9 gene

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: 7p15.2
- Strand: plus strand

## Pathology
- HOXA9 plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis and its dysregulation has been implicated in various types of leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

## Function
- HOXA9 encodes a transcription factor that binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival.
- Plays a critical role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells.

## Related Disease
- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Various targeted therapies are being studied to treat leukemia patients who have a HOXA9 dysregulation.
- Anti-CD123 immunotoxins have shown promising results in preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials as a potential treatment for AML with HOXA9 overexpression.
- Patients with high level of HOXA9 expression have shown a reduced overall survival and a higher risk of relapse.

## Drug Response
- There are ongoing studies to identify novel drugs that can target HOXA9 abnormalities.
