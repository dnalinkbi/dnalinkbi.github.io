# Information about gene TERT

1. Genetic Position:
The TERT gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 5 at position 15.33.

2. Pathology:
The TERT gene is commonly associated with various types of cancer, including melanoma, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer.

3. Function:
The TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is responsible for maintaining telomere length in cells. Telomeres are the protective endcaps of chromosomes, and telomerase activity is necessary for preventing chromosomal instability and maintaining cell proliferation.

4. External IDs and Aliases:

  - HGNC: 11727
  - NCBI Entrez: 7015
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000164362
  - OMIM: 187270
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O14746

5. AA mutation list and mutation types with dbSNP ID:
The TERT gene has multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with an increased risk for cancer, including:

  - rs2736098: Substitution of cytosine for thymine at position 124 in the promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases transcriptional activity and is associated with an increased risk for various types of cancer.
  - rs10069690: Substitution of guanine for adenine at position 177 in the promoter region of the TERT gene, which is also associated with an increased risk for various types of cancer.

6. Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
The TERT gene has multiple somatic mutations associated with cancer, including:

  - rs146670315: Substitution of adenine for guanine at position 129 in exon 5 of the TERT gene, which is associated with an increased risk for urothelial carcinoma.
  - rs61748181: Substitution of cytosine for thymine at position 138 in exon 5 of the TERT gene, which is associated with an increased risk for brain and breast cancer.

7. Related diseases:
The TERT gene is commonly associated with a variety of cancers, including melanoma, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and glioma.

8. Treatment and prognosis:
Targeting telomerase activity has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, the prognosis and treatment options for cancer depend on several factors, including the specific cancer type, stage, and individual patient characteristics.

9. Drug response:
Various telomerase inhibitors have been developed and evaluated for cancer treatment, including imetelstat, GRN163L, and BIBR1532. However, clinical trials have had mixed results.
