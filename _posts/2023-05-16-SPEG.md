# Gene Information for SPEG

## Gene Position
The SPEG (Striated Muscle Enriched Protein Kinase) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q35).

## Gene Function
SPEG encodes a protein that belongs to the myosin-binding protein kinases family. The protein plays a critical role in striated and cardiac muscle contraction by regulating the assembly and maintenance of the contractile apparatus.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the SPEG gene are associated with several cardiac disorders such as dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as skeletal muscle abnormalities including nemaline myopathy and centronuclear myopathy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for SPEG-related disorders typically involves managing the symptoms with medication, cardiac device implantation, or in some cases a heart transplant. The prognosis varies depending on the specific SPEG mutation and the severity of the associated disorder.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response related to SPEG mutations.
