# Gene Information for PAFAH1B1

## Genetic Position
PAFAH1B1 is located on chromosome 17p13.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PAFAH1B1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, including lissencephaly, subcortical band heterotopia, and isolated pachygyria.

## Function
The protein encoded by the PAFAH1B1 gene, also known as LIS1, plays a critical role in neuronal migration during brain development. It is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and interacts with dynein, a molecular motor protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic variants have been reported in PAFAH1B1.

## Related Disease
Mutations in PAFAH1B1 have been associated with several neurological disorders, including:
- Lissencephaly, a rare brain malformation characterized by a smooth brain surface, severe intellectual disability, and seizures.
- Subcortical band heterotopia, a condition in which the brain surface has an extra layer of gray matter.
- Isolated pachygyria, a condition in which the folds of the brain are broad and abnormally spaced.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for the neurological conditions associated with PAFAH1B1 mutations. Treatment is focused on symptom management and supportive care. The prognosis varies depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
No specific drugs have been developed to target PAFAH1B1 mutations. However, some symptoms associated with lissencephaly may be treated with antiepileptic drugs.
