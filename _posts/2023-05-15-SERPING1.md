## Gene Information

**Gene:** SERPING1

**Function:** The SERPING1 gene codes for a protein called C1 inhibitor, which plays a role in regulating inflammation and the immune response.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 8944
- NCBI Entrez: 710
- Ensembl: ENSG00000181019
- OMIM: 606860
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P05155
- Genomic location: Chromosome 11q12.1

**Aliases:** C1IN, C1INH, HAE1, HAE2, HDW, HAE3

## Genetic Variations

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Ala384Thr | Missense | rs121909632 |
| Arg444Gly | Missense | rs28939070 |
| Arg184Cys | Missense | rs121909633 |

| Thr212Met | Missense | rs138905988 |
| Arg490Gly | Missense | rs121909631 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

## Related Disease

Mutations in the SERPING1 gene can cause hereditary angioedema (HAE), an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and airway.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for HAE typically involves replacement therapy with C1 inhibitor protein or medications that prevent production of substances that contributes to swelling and inflammation.

Prognosis for HAE is generally good with proper management, but severe airway swelling can be life-threatening.

## Drug Response

Some medications used in the treatment of HAE, such as ecallantide and icatibant, may be less effective in individuals with certain SERPING1 mutations.
