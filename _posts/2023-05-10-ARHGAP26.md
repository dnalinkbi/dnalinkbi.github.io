### Gene Information

**Gene Symbol:** ARHGAP26

**Aliases:** GTPase-activating protein 26, GRAF

**Chromosome location:** 5q31.3

**Genomic coordinates (GRCh38):** NC_000005.10:g.140,188,087_140,581,949

**Function for gene:** ARHGAP26 encodes a protein called GRAF (GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase) which interacts with multiple proteins to modulate actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and cell migration.
