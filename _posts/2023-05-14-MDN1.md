## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** MDN1

**Function for Gene:** This gene encodes for a microtubule severing ATPase protein that plays a crucial role in mitotic spindle dynamics during cell division.

**External IDs :**
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 5q15.2
- Gene ID: 55357
- Aliases: KIAA0513, MIDASIN, DEAD/H (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp/His) box polypeptide 51

**External Sites:**
- HGNC: 23745
- NCBI Entrez: 55357
- Ensembl: ENSG00000145822
- OMIM: 614178
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6X3

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID currently reported for MDN1 gene.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in MDN1 gene have been associated with:
- Multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (MONA) syndrome
- Cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy syndrome (CDFE)
- Spastic paraplegia-80, autosomal recessive (SPG80)

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no complete cure for MONA syndrome, which is the primary disease associated with MDN1 mutations. Treatment is usually focused on the management of symptoms. However, CDFE and SPG80 treatments are focused on antiepileptic drugs and physical therapy respectively, to help improve motor function.

## Drug Response

There is currently no specific drug response mentioned in the literature available for MDN1 gene mutations.
