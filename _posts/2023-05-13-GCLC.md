## Gene: GCLC

### Genomic Position:
The GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit) gene is located on chromosome 6p12.2 in humans.

### Pathology and Function:
The GCLC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of glutathione, a vital antioxidant in cells. Mutations in GCLC have been associated with various diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.
