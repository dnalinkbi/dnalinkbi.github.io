## Gene Information

- Gene: TRMU
- External IDs: HGNC:16304, NCBI Entrez Gene: 55147, Ensembl: ENSG00000162326, OMIM: 610230, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NUN5
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 6q25.2
- Aliases: tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase (TRMU), mitochondrial 

## Function

The TRMU gene encodes for a tRNA methyltransferase which is responsible for the modification of the nucleotide at position 5 of the wobble uridine in the mitochondrial tRNAs. This modification plays an important role in the correct folding and function of tRNAs.

## Mutation information

- AA Mutation list: Some common missense mutations in TRMU gene are as follows:
   - p.Gly43Cys
   - p.Ala57Thr
   - p.Gly67Arg
   - p.Thr139Met
- Mutation type: Missense
- dbSNP IDs: rs61736530, rs7829893, rs145304914, rs2275982 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the TRMU gene.

## Related disease

Mutations in the TRMU gene have been found to be associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders, which lead to a broad range of clinical manifestations including myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes.

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. Treatment mainly focuses on symptom management and supportive care.

## Drug response

There is limited data available on drug response specific to TRMU mutations. However, some studies have shown potential benefit from treatment with vitamins and supplements such as coenzyme Q10, thiamine, and carnitine.
