## Information about Gene MVK

### Genetic Position
The MVK gene is located on chromosome 12q24.11.

### Pathology
Mutations in the MVK gene are associated with mevalonic aciduria, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This disorder is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme mevalonate kinase, which is encoded by the MVK gene. Mevalonic aciduria is characterized by recurrent fevers, and other symptoms may include a rash, joint pain, and abdominal pain.

### Function
The MVK gene encodes the mevalonate kinase enzyme, which is involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other essential molecules. The mevalonate pathway is also important for the regulation of inflammation.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic mutations have been reported for the MVK gene.

### Related Disease
Mevalonic aciduria, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the MVK gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for mevalonic aciduria, but symptoms can be managed with medications that target the inflammatory response, such as anakinra and canakinumab.

### Drug Response
Anakinra and canakinumab have shown promising results in the treatment of patients with mevalonic aciduria.
