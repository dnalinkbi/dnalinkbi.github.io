## Gene PLOD3

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 7: 70,984,457-71,229,927

**Aliases**: LH3, PLOD1, PLOD2, PLOD3A, PLOD3B

**Function for gene**: The PLOD3 gene encodes for lysyl hydroxylase 3, an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. Specifically, lysyl hydroxylase 3 catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen, which is important for the stabilization of the collagen triple helix structure.

**Related Diseases**: Mutations in the PLOD3 gene have been associated with various forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of inherited connective tissue disorders that affect the skin, joints, and blood vessels.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no specific treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by PLOD3 mutations. Treatment is generally supportive and aimed at managing symptoms such as joint pain and skin fragility. Prognosis varies depending on the subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and the severity of symptoms.

**Drug Response**: Not applicable.
