### Gene: ZBTB18 

#### Information about Gene

ZBTB18 (Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 18) gene is also known as RP58 (Repressor protein 58) which encodes a transcriptional repressor that belongs to the Zinc finger family. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.3) and contains 5 exons. This gene is highly conserved across many species, and it is expressed in many tissues, including the brain, testis, kidney, and liver.

#### Function of Gene 

The protein encoded by the ZBTB18 gene is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with DNA through its Zinc finger domains, binds to specific sites on DNA, and inhibits RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. In the brain, this protein plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation and migration, and it is essential for proper development of the cerebral cortex. Moreover, mutations in the ZBTB18 gene have been linked to cognitive impairment and intellectual disability.

| rs113488023   | SNP                   |

#### Related Disease 

Mutations in the ZBTB18 gene have been linked with several neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech delay, and autism spectrum disorders. Additionally, ZBTB18 has also been found to be down-regulated in several cancers, including ovarian, colon, and breast cancer. 

#### Treatment and Prognosis 

There is no specific treatment available for genetic disorders caused by mutations in the ZBTB18 gene. However, treatments are provided based on the symptoms and severity of the condition. Early diagnosis and intervention can improve the prognosis. 

#### Drug Response 

No specific drugs have been developed that target the ZBTB18 gene.
