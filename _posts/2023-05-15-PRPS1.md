# Information about Gene PRPS1

**Genetic Position:** The PRPS1 gene is located on the X chromosome at the Xq22.3 position.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the PRPS1 gene have been linked to several diseases including X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMTX5), Arts syndrome, and X-linked non-syndromic hearing impairment.

**Function for Gene:** The PRPS1 gene encodes an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-1) which is involved in the production of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. It also plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in PRPS1 have been associated with several diseases including:
- X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMTX5)
- Arts syndrome
- X-linked non-syndromic hearing impairment

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with PRPS1 mutations varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no drug specifically designed to target PRPS1 mutations. However, treatment options for diseases associated with PRPS1 mutations may include medications to manage symptoms.
