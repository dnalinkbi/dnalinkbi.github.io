# Information about gene ADAMTS13

## Genetic Position
The ADAMTS13 gene is located on chromosome 9q34.2.

## Pathology
The ADAMTS13 gene encodes for the ADAMTS13 protein which is responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor multimers. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 protein leads to accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers that cause platelet aggregation, microthrombi formation and eventually thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia.

## Function
The ADAMTS13 gene encodes for a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers into smaller fragments. This is important for preventing the formation of platelet-rich microthrombi that cause thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some of the known somatic mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | dbSNP ID |
|:--------:|:--------:|
| c.4012delG | rs80338721 |
| c.69G>A | rs80338722 |
| c.3018_3019insT | rs80338723 |

## Related Disease
Deficiency of ADAMTS13 protein leads to a rare disorder known as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This condition is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms and widespread microthrombi formation in small blood vessels.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for TTP commonly includes plasmapheresis, which is the removal and replacement of the patientâ€™s plasma, as well as administration of immunosuppressive therapy. The prognosis for the patient with TTP is generally good if treated promptly.

## Drug Response
Currently, no specific drugs are available to directly target ADAMTS13 protein. However, plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive therapy are the primary treatment options used in patients affected with ADAMTS13 deficiency.
