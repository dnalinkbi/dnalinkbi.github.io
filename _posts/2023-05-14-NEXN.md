## Gene Information

- **Gene name:** NEXN (Nexilin F-actin binding protein)
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 20164
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 10588
    - Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000160905
    - OMIM: 611936
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6J0
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 1 (1p31.1)
- **Function for gene:** NEXN is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and maintenance of the cytoskeleton. It regulates the actin cytoskeleton by crosslinking actin filaments and by directly regulating actin dynamics through interaction with proteins that regulate actin dynamics.
  
## Mutations and Variations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Arg237Trp (rs878853912), missense variant
    - p.Pro340Ala (rs878853913), missense variant
    - p.Gly378Arg (rs760680767), missense variant
    - p.Arg501Cys (rs148452936), missense variant
    - p.Arg501His (rs878853906), missense variant
    - p.Arg508CysfsTer22 (rs775058696), frameshift variant
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - There are several somatic mutations reported for NEXN in various cancer types in the COSMIC database, but no dbSNP IDs are available.
  
## Related Diseases

- Mutations in NEXN have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by the enlargement of the heart chambers and reduced cardiac function.
- Mutations in NEXN have also been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition in which the walls of the heart thicken, making it harder for the heart to pump blood.
  
## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may involve medication, lifestyle changes, and surgery in severe cases.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the cardiomyopathy and the effectiveness of treatment.
  
## Drug Response

- There is currently no specific drug targeting NEXN for the treatment of cardiomyopathy.
