# IMMT Gene

## Genetic Position
The IMMT gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q33.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the IMMT gene have been associated with multiple diseases including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and mitochondrial diseases.

## Function
IMMT encodes for the inner mitochondrial membrane protein, which plays a key role in maintaining the shape and function of mitochondria. It is involved in the formation of cristae, which are important for oxidative phosphorylation.
