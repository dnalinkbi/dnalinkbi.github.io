## Gene ACSL6
### Information:

- **Function for gene:** ACSL6 (Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 6) is an enzyme that catalyzes the activation of long-chain fatty acids for both energy metabolism and lipid synthesis in the cells. It converts long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids to their corresponding CoA esters, which are crucial for various cellular activities, including membrane synthesis, cellular signaling, and energy production.
