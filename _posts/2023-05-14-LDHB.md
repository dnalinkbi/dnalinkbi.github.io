## Gene LDHB

**Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function**

LDHB is a gene located on chromosome 12q24.31. It encodes for lactate dehydrogenase B, which is a subunit of the LDH tetramer. The LDH tetramer is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of lactic acid to pyruvic acid. 

Defects in the LDHB gene have been associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and Burkitt lymphoma. Mutations in LDHB have also been linked to muscle fatigue and exercise intolerance.

**Function for Gene**
- Encodes for lactate dehydrogenase B
- Involved in the catalysis of lactic acid to pyruvic acid

**Treatment and Prognosis**
- Treatment options depend on the underlying condition caused by the LDHB mutation.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

**Drug Response**
- Drug response varies depending on the underlying condition caused by the LDHB mutation.
