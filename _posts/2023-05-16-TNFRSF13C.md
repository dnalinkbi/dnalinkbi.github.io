# Gene: TNFRSF13C

## Genetic Position
The TNFRSF13C gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TNFRSF13C gene have been associated with primary immunodeficiency disorders, including common variable immunodeficiency and selective IgA deficiency.

## Function
The TNFRSF13C gene encodes for the transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) protein, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. TACI is a B-cell receptor and plays a role in the development and differentiation of B cells.
