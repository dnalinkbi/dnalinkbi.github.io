# Gene FASN

## Gene information
- **Function:** Encodes for an enzyme called fatty acid synthase (FAS) that plays a key role in the synthesis of fatty acids in the body.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 2194
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 17q25.3 
    - Aliases: FAS, FASalpha, OA-519
- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: 3548
    - NCBI Entrez: 2194
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000171616
    - OMIM: 600781
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49327

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Gly872Arg (missense) - rs28929474
    - p.Ala934Thr (missense) - rs121912674

## Related diseases
- FASN has been found to be overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, and ovarian cancer. Additionally, FASN has been associated with metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and obesity.

## Treatment and prognosis
- FASN inhibitors, such as orlistat, have been shown to reduce tumor growth in preclinical models of cancer. However, there are currently no approved FASN inhibitors for clinical use.
- The prognosis for patients with FASN-related diseases varies depending on the specific condition and its stage.

## Drug response
- FASN inhibitors have shown potential in preclinical studies as a treatment for cancer, but more research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in humans.
