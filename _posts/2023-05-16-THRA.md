## Gene Information

- Gene symbol: THRA
- Gene name: Thyroid hormone receptor alpha
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17: 38,626,386-38,762,820
- Aliases: ERBA; NR1A1; THRA1

## Function
THRA encodes a transcription factor for thyroid hormone which regulates the expression of target genes involved in various biological processes such as growth, development, and metabolism.

## External IDs and Sites

- HGNC: 11894
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 7067
- Ensembl: ENSG00000121749
- OMIM: 190160
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P10827

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg383Gln (rs1805128)
- p.Glu457Asp (rs71443666)
- p.Pro398His (rs41305947)

## Related Disease
Mutations in THRA are associated with resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome which presents with varying clinical manifestations such as goiter, tachycardia, and cognitive impairment.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Therapeutic options for resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome include thyroid hormone analogs, management of symptoms and regular monitoring of thyroid function tests. The prognosis for individuals with this condition is generally favorable.

## Drug Response
Some studies have shown that patients with resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome may not respond to standard thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
