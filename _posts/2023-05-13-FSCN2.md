### Information about gene FSCN2

**Genetic Position:** FSCN2 is a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 17q25.3.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the FSCN2 gene have been associated with certain neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

**Function:** FSCN2 encodes a protein called Fascin-2, which is primarily expressed in neurons and is involved in the maintenance of dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity.

**Related Disease:** 

- Schizophrenia (SCZD)
- Bipolar disorder (BPD)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis for SCZD and BPD can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual patient. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication and therapy.

**Drug Response:** Various medications have been used to treat SCZD and BPD, including antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. However, the effectiveness of these medications can vary significantly between patients.
