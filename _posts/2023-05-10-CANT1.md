# Information about Gene CANT1

## Genetic Position
CANT1 gene is located on chromosome 17, at the position 17q25.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CANT1 gene are related to Desbuquois dysplasia type 1 (DBQD1), a rare autosomal recessive skeletal disorder characterized by short stature, joint laxity, scoliosis, a distinct facial phenotype, and advanced carpal ossification.

## Function
The CANT1 gene encodes an intracellular calcium release channel that regulates bone development by controlling the proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes, which plays a crucial role in the formation of cartilage and bone tissue.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for DBQD1, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms. Surgical interventions may be required in some cases. The prognosis of DBQD1 varies depending on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug treatment for DBQD1.
