## **Gene CYB5A**

### **Genetic Position**
CYB5A gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 at position 11.32. 

### **Pathology**
CYB5A gene is associated with several diseases such as congenital methemoglobinemia, autosomal recessive hereditary methemoglobinemia, and nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.

### **Function**
CYB5A represents a member of the cytochrome b5 protein family that plays a crucial role in electron transfer reactions in the processes of drug metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and fatty acid desaturation.

### **External IDs**
- Gene ID: 1549
- Genomic Location: Chr18:32874763-32888006
- Alias: CMPRO, CYB5, CYB5-L, KMDOB

### **Somatic SNVs/InDels**
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels  present in CYB5A, but there are no dbSNP IDs available for these variants.

### **Related Disease**
CYB5A gene mutations are related to Methemoglobinemia and Hemolytic Anemia.

### **Treatment and Prognosis**
Treatment for Methemoglobinemia may include methylene blue injection, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and administering pure oxygen, while treatment for Hemolytic Anemia may include blood transfusions, blood and urine tests and medication.

### **Drug Response**
CYB5A gene is associated with drug response in the metabolism of drugs like antipyrine, caffeine, and phenobarbital.
