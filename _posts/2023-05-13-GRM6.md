## Gene Information

**Gene Symbol:** GRM6

**Function:** The GRM6 gene encodes a protein, Metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), that belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors and is highly expressed in the retina of the eye. It plays an important role in signal transduction between photoreceptor cells and bipolar cells in the retina.

## Related Diseases
- Autosomal recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1A)
- Achromatopsia

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for CSNB1A or Achromatopsia. Treatment options are limited to vision rehabilitation and assistive technology.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs specifically targeted towards GRM6-related diseases. However, some drugs like PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to improve the visual performance in patients with CSNB1A.
