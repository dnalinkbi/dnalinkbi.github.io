# Information about gene TRPC6

## Genetic position and genomic location

The TRPC6 gene is located on chromosome 11p21.2. The genomic coordinates are: start 17,696,058 and end 17,736,982.

## Pathology/function

The TRPC6 gene encodes a protein called transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6 (TRPC6). This protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels and plays an important role in calcium signaling pathways.

TRPC6 is primarily expressed in the kidney and regulates calcium entry in podocytes, which are specialized cells in the glomeruli of the kidney. Mutations in TRPC6 are associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a progressive form of kidney disease.

## Related disease

Mutations in TRPC6 are associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is characterized by scarring of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli).

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for FSGS depends on the severity of the disease and may include medications to control blood pressure and reduce proteinuria (excess protein in the urine). In some cases, kidney transplantation may be necessary.

The prognosis for FSGS varies depending on the severity of the disease and response to treatment. In some cases, FSGS can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires dialysis or kidney transplantation.

## Drug response

Several drugs have been studied for the treatment of FSGS, including immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. However, response to these drugs can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the disease.
