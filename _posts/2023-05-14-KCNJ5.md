# Gene KCNJ5

## Genetic Position and Function:

The KCNJ5 gene is located on chromosome 11q24.3 and encodes for a potassium channel protein that is expressed in adrenal gland cells. This protein plays a critical role in regulating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, which is necessary for normal adrenal gland function and hormone regulation.

## External IDs and Aliases:

- HGNC: 6247
- NCBI Entrez: 3767
- Ensembl: ENSG00000150688
- OMIM: 600734
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15842

Aliases for this gene include: GIRK4, KATP1, Kir3.4

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:

Several amino acid mutations have been identified in the KCNJ5 gene, including:

- p.Gly151Arg (rs117015504)
- p.Leu168His (rs199767170)
- p.Leu168Arg (rs137852679)
- p.Glu224Lys (rs267606824)

These mutations are somatic and occur in adrenal gland cells. They are associated with aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas and result in the overproduction of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:

In addition to the AA mutations listed above, somatic SNVs and InDels have been identified in the KCNJ5 gene in association with aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas. Some of these variants are:

- c.650G>A (rs587782702)
- c.482G>A (rs781093877)
- c.669_671del (rs58277676)

## Related Disease:

Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene are associated with primary aldosteronism, a condition characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal gland. Primary aldosteronism can lead to high blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis:

Treatment for primary aldosteronism typically involves medication to control blood pressure and reduce the production of aldosterone. Surgery may also be considered in some cases. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response:

Studies have shown that specific mutations in the KCNJ5 gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to certain drugs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, which are commonly used to treat primary aldosteronism.
