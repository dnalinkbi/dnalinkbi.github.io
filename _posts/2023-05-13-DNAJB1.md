# Gene Information for DNAJB1

## Genetic Position
The DNAJB1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in DNAJB1 have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, and lung cancer. Additionally, mutations in DNAJB1 have been linked to the neurological disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2K.

## Function
The DNAJB1 gene encodes a protein called DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 1 (DNAJB1), which is a member of the heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) family. DNAJB1 functions as a co-chaperone, aiding in the folding of other proteins and preventing them from misfolding or aggregating.

## Related Disease
Mutations in DNAJB1 have been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2K. Additionally, alterations in DNAJB1 expression have been observed in various types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in DNAJB1. The prognosis for individuals with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2K varies, with some individuals experiencing mild symptoms while others experience severe disability.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specifically related to mutations in DNAJB1.
