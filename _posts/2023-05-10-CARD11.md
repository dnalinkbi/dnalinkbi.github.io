# Gene CARD11

CARD11, also known as Caspase recruitment domain family member 11, is a protein-coding gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. This gene plays a critical role in the immune system by regulating signaling pathways that activate immune responses. The CARD11 protein is involved in several signaling pathways that are important for activating T-cells and B-cells in response to infections.

## Function

The CARD11 gene encodes a scaffold protein that interacts with other proteins involved in immune cell activation. The CARD11 protein contains several domains, including caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a coiled-coil domain, and a membrane-associated guanylate kinase domain (MAGUK). These domains enable CARD11 to interact with other proteins, such as BCL10 and MALT1, to form a complex known as the CBM complex. This CBM complex is essential for activating various immune signaling pathways, including the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported mutations in the CARD11 gene that have been associated with various diseases. Some of these mutations include:

- c.3157G>A (p.R1053Q) - rs149768491
- c.3295C>T (p.R1099W) - rs149018992
- c.3376C>T (p.T1126M) - rs200893869
- c.3496C>T (p.Q1166*) - rs757176626

These mutations are missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations that have been associated with various diseases, including B-cell lymphoma and immunodeficiency.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are numerous somatic mutations reported in the CARD11 gene associated with different cancers.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CARD11 gene have been associated with various diseases, including T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, and immunodeficiency.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for CARD11-related diseases depends on the specific disease and its severity. For example, patients with immunodeficiency may require bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy. In contrast, patients with lymphomas may require chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy.

Prognosis also varies depending on the specific disease and its severity. Patients with immunodeficiency may have a reduced life expectancy due to recurring infections. Likewise, patients with lymphomas may have a more favorable prognosis if the cancer is caught early and is still localized.

## Drug Response

There are several drugs currently available for the treatment of various CARD11-related diseases, including immunomodulatory drugs, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies.
