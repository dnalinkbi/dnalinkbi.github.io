# Gene: CTLA4

## Genetic Position
- CTLA4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33.2)
- The gene spans ~3.5 kb and contains 4 exons

## Pathology and Function
- CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is a protein that plays a key role in immune regulation by downregulating T cell activation and proliferation. 
- CTLA4 is expressed on Treg cells and activated T cells, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor by competing with CD28 for the same ligands (CD80/CD86) on antigen-presenting cells. 
- Mutations in CTLA4 may lead to impaired immune tolerance and development of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Related Diseases
- Autoimmune diseases: Type 1 diabetes, Autoimmune thyroid disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Cancer: CTLA4 blocking antibodies have been approved for the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer 

## Treatment and Prognosis
- CTLA4 blocking antibodies (e.g., ipilimumab) have been approved for treating metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer
- Prognosis depends on the underlying disease and severity of symptoms

## Drug response
- CTLA4 blocking antibodies have shown high response rates in melanoma and lung cancer patients. However, they can also lead to severe side effects such as colitis, hepatitis, and hypophysitis.
