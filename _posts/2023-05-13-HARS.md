# Information about Gene HARS

## Gene Position

Gene HARS (Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase) is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 at position 5q31.2.

## Pathology

Mutations in the HARS gene have been associated with several diseases, including Usher syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Leukoencephalopathy.

## Function

The HARS gene encodes for the histidyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by attaching histidine to its cognate tRNA molecule.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs and InDels in the HARS gene, but no dbSNP IDs have been assigned to them.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the HARS gene have been associated with several disorders. These include:

- Usher syndrome
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- Leukoencephalopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment and prognosis for individuals with mutations in the HARS gene vary depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available regarding drug response for individuals with mutations in the HARS gene.
