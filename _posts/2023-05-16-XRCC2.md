# Gene XRCC2

## Genetic Position
The XRCC2 gene is located on chromosome 7 at position q36.1, from base pair 146,024,511 to base pair 146,042,573.

## Pathology
XRCC2 is a DNA damage repair gene. Mutations in this gene can result in impaired DNA repair processes, leading to genomic instability.

## Function
The XRCC2 protein is involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks through homologous recombination. Specifically, it interacts with other proteins such as RAD51 to facilitate the strand invasion step in this process.

## Related Disease
XRCC2 mutations have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer and glioma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments for XRCC2 mutations. Prognosis depends on the type and severity of associated disease.

## Drug Response
XRCC2 mutations may impact response to chemotherapy drugs that induce DNA damage, such as cisplatin and carboplatin.
