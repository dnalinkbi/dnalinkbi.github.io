## Information about Gene ANGPTL3

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position:** ANGPTL3 is located on chromosome 1 in the q23.2 region.

**Pathology:** Mutations in ANGPTL3 have been associated with reduced levels of plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Reduced ANGPTL3 activity has also been linked to a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease and peripheral arterial disease.

**Function:** ANGPTL3 encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. It functions as a potent inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the blood. ANGPTL3 also inhibits the activity of endothelial lipase (EL), an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids and triglycerides. By inhibiting these lipases, ANGPTL3 prevents the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation, leading to elevated plasma triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.

### Related Diseases
- ANGPTL3 Deficiency
- Familial Combined Hypolipidemia
- Hyperlipoproteinemia, Type 2
- Hypoalphalipoproteinemia
- Metabolic Syndrome
- Hypercholesterolemia

### Treatment and Prognosis
Reducing ANGPTL3 activity through genetic or pharmacological means has been shown to reduce plasma lipid levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The development of ANGPTL3 inhibitors is currently under investigation.

### Drug Response
Evkeeza (evinacumab), an ANGPTL3 inhibitor, has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.
