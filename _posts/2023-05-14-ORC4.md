# Gene: ORC4

## Genetic Position
The ORC4 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 2 at position 31.1 (2q31.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in the ORC4 gene have been found to be associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, small ears, and microcephaly.

## Function
The ORC4 gene encodes a protein component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is involved in the initiation of DNA replication. Specifically, ORC4 helps to recruit the MCM complex, another protein complex involved in DNA replication.
