# Information about Gene VWF

## Genetic Position
- The VWF gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12, specifically on position 12p13.31.

## Pathology
- Mutations in the VWF gene can lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD), which is characterized by bleeding tendency due to impaired platelet function and deficient VWF protein.

## Function for Gene
- The VWF gene encodes von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein, which plays a crucial role in blood clotting and platelet function. VWF protein is responsible for binding to platelet glycoprotein and forming a platelet plug at the site of injury.

## External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
- External IDs for gene: HGNC:12741, NCBI Entrez Gene:7450, Ensembl:ENSG00000110799, OMIM:613160, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P04275
- Genomic location: Chromosome 12, 12p13.31
- Aliases: von Willebrand factor, coagulation factor VIII-related antigen, VWD, VWFA

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg2185Gln missense mutation (rs6025) is associated with VWD type 2A and VWD type 2M.
- p.Arg1205His missense mutation (rs1063856) is associated with VWD type 2B.
- p.Val1316Met missense mutation (rs1800388) is associated with VWD type 2B.
- p.Tyr1584Cys missense mutation (rs201073717) is associated with VWD type 2N.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs387906821 is a somatic SNV associated with breast cancer.

## Related Disease
- Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the VWF gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for VWD includes replacement therapy with VWF concentrates or factor VIII concentrates. 
- The prognosis for VWD is generally good with appropriate treatment.

## Drug Response
- Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic ADH analog that can be used to stimulate the release of VWF and factor VIII from the endothelium and reduce bleeding in patients with VWD.
