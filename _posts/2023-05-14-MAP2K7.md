# Gene Information: MAP2K7

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Gene Coordinates: 47,909,289-47,935,588
- Strand: Minus Strand

## Pathology
There is evidence suggesting that MAP2K7 plays a role in the development and progression of various types of cancer.

## Function
MAP2K7 encodes a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family, which are protein kinases that phosphorylate and activate various MAP kinases. This specific protein kinase is involved in stress response pathways and may also play a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6841
- NCBI Entrez: 5608
- Ensembl: ENSG00000006283
- OMIM: 602715
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13163
- Aliases: JNKK, JNKK1, MAPKK7, MEK7, MKK7, PRKRIR 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) that have been identified in MAP2K7:
- p.Lys95Glu (rs148041346)
- p.Gly97Arg (rs768029903)

- p.Asp320His (rs757733714)
- p.Arg334Trp (rs58698256)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic variants that have been identified in MAP2K7:
- p.Gln56Arg (rs869025841)
- p.Gly77Cys (rs878853430)
- p.Ala284Thr (rs766109201)

## Related Disease
Abnormal MAP2K7 expression has been associated with several diseases, including various types of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Further research is needed to determine the potential clinical implications of targeting MAP2K7 in cancer treatment. 

## Drug Response
There is currently limited information about drug response relating to MAP2K7.
