# Gene: NCF1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: q11.23

## Pathology
NCF1 (Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor 1) gene encodes a protein called p47phox (a subunit of NADPH oxidase). NADPH oxidase is responsible for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils, which are important for their innate immune function.

## Function
NCF1 plays a crucial role in the activation of NADPH oxidase, leading to the production of ROS in neutrophils. These ROS are important for killing invading pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi.

## Related Disease
Mutations in NCF1 have been associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare inherited disorder of the immune system. CGD patients have defects in NADPH oxidase, leading to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment for CGD. Patients are also managed with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis and immunomodulatory therapy to prevent infections.

## Drug Response
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is sometimes used to treat infections in CGD patients, as it can stimulate NADPH oxidase-independent pathways for killing pathogens.
