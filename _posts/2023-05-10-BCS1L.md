# Gene BCS1L

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2: 21,594,555-21,631,719
- **Pathology**: Mutations in BCS1L gene can lead to mitochondrial complex III deficiency and can cause diseases such as Bjornstad syndrome, GRACILE syndrome, and Leigh syndrome.
- **Function:** BCS1L gene encodes a protein that is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex III, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation.
