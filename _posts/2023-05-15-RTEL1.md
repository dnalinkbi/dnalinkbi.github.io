## Information about gene RTEL1

- **Genetic position**: The RTEL1 gene is located on chromosome 20 at the position 20q13.33.

- **Pathology**: Mutations in RTEL1 have been associated with a number of diseases including Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, and some forms of cancer.

- **Function for gene**: The RTEL1 gene encodes for a DNA helicase enzyme that plays a role in DNA replication, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:

There are several somatic mutations in RTEL1 that have been reported in different forms of cancer. Some examples include:

| Mutation | Cancer Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| c.2698C>T | Hepatocellular carcinoma | rs771656201 |
| c.2602A>G | Breast cancer | rs776003611 |
| c.2164C>T | Non-small cell lung cancer | rs568626507 |
| c.2770T>C | Ovarian cancer | rs765129165 |

- **Related disease**: Mutations in RTEL1 have been linked to several diseases including Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, and Coats plus syndrome. In addition, somatic mutations in RTEL1 have been observed in various forms of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and the severity of the associated symptoms. For example, patients with Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome may require bone marrow transplants or gene therapy, while those with dyskeratosis congenita may require blood transfusions or stem cell transplants.

- **Drug response**: There is limited information on drug response related to mutations in RTEL1. However, some studies suggest that targeting RTEL1 could be a potential strategy for treating certain forms of cancer.
