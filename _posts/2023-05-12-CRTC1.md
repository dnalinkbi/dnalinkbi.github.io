## Gene: CRTC1

- Function: CRTC1 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1) is involved in modulating the transcriptional activity of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and plays a role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. It has also been shown to play a role in the development of neuronal plasticity and memory.

- Related disease: CRTC1 has been implicated in various diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Specifically, somatic mutations in CRTC1 have been found in various types of cancer, including lung cancer, melanoma, and thyroid cancer.
  
- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and mutation(s) involved. Currently, there are no specific treatments targeting CRTC1 mutations, but research is ongoing in this area.

- Drug response: There is limited information available on drug response specifically related to CRTC1 mutations. However, certain drugs targeting downstream pathways or related genes (e.g. CREB) may be effective in treating related diseases such as cancer and diabetes.
