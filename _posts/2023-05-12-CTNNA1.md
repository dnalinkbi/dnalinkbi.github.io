# Gene: CTNNA1 

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 5, from base pair 56,171,246 to base pair 56,507,847 (GRCh38.p13).
- **Pathology:** CTNNA1 has been linked to various diseases, including familial hypercholesterolemia, Wilms tumor, diffuse gastric cancer, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
- **Function:** CTNNA1 encodes alpha-catenin, a protein that forms part of adherens junctions, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion. Alpha-catenin also interacts with other proteins to regulate cortical actin assembly and to mediate signal transduction pathways.

### Identification
- **External IDs:** HGNC:2508; Entrez Gene:1495; Ensembl:ENSG00000054598; OMIM:116805; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P35221.
- **Aliases:** alpha E-catenin; catenin alpha-1; p120.
