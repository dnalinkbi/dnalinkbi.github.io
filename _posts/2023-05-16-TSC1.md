# Information on Gene TSC1

## Genetic Position
The TSC1 gene is located on chromosome 9q34.13, specifically from base pair 78,557,982 to 78,678,951.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TSC1 gene have been associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by benign tumor growth in various organs including the brain, kidneys, and lungs. 

## Function 
The TSC1 gene encodes for the protein hamartin, which interacts with the product of the TSC2 gene, tuberin, to form the TSC protein complex. This complex regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, which plays a critical role in cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

## Related Diseases
- Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatments for TSC are currently limited to managing symptoms and controlling tumor growth. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
Several targeted drugs are currently being developed for TSC, including inhibitors of the mTORC1 pathway such as rapamycin and its analogs.
