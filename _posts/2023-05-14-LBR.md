## Gene Information

The LBR gene encodes for the lamin B receptor protein which is located in the inner nuclear membrane. The function of this protein is to bind and anchor the nuclear lamina to the inner membrane, and it is involved in chromatin organization, DNA replication and repair, and regulation of gene expression.

## Gene IDs and Location

- Gene ID: 3930
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1: 153,732,928-153,748,887
- Aliases: LBR, LBR1, Lamin B receptor

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the LBR gene in the COSMIC database.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the LBR gene have been associated with several disorders such as Pelger-Huet anomaly, which is a rare genetic condition that affects the shape of white blood cells.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for LBR gene mutations, but symptoms can be treated depending on the specific disorder. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disorder caused by the mutation.

## Drug Response

There are currently no drugs targeting the LBR gene.
