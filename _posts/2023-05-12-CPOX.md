# Gene Information for CPOX 

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Gene Name**: CPOX
- **Chromosome location**: Chromosome 3 (3q11.2)
- **Pathology**: CPOX gene mutations can lead to a rare genetic disorder called hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), which affects the production of heme in the body. HCP can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, photosensitivity, and neuropsychiatric disturbances.
- **Function**: CPOX encodes an enzyme called coproporphyrinogen oxidase, which is involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX, which is then further processed into heme.

## Gene Identifiers and Aliases

- **External IDs**: 
  - HGNC: 2343
  - NCBI Entrez: 1371
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000114771
  - OMIM: 121300
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P36551
- **Aliases**: CPO, COPROX, CPOX_HUMAN

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the CPOX gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Diseases

- Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for hereditary coproporphyria. Treatment options include avoiding triggers such as certain medications or fasting, as well as administering heme or hemin to help regulate heme production.
- Prognosis varies and depends on the severity of symptoms and the age at which HCP develops. Some cases may have mild symptoms that can be managed with treatment, while others may experience more severe symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life.

## Drug Response

- Patients with hereditary coproporphyria may have hypersensitivity reactions to certain medications, such as barbiturates and sulfonamides. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of this when prescribing medications.
