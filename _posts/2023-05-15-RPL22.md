# Gene: RPL22

## Genetic Position
RPL22 is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p36.11. 

## Pathology
Mutations in RPL22 have been associated with various types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma.

## Function
RPL22 is a ribosomal protein that plays a role in the assembly and function of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It is involved in protein synthesis and has been shown to regulate the expression of certain genes through interactions with miRNAs.
