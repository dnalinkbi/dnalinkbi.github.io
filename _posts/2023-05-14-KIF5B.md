## Gene Information: Kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B)

### Genetic Position:
The KIF5B gene is located on chromosome 10 at the position 10q11.23.

### Pathology:
KIF5B has been noted to have gene fusions in various cancer types, most notably in lung adenocarcinoma. In particular, the KIF5B-RET fusion has been identified and is associated with a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cases.

### Function:
The KIF5B gene encodes a member of the kinesin family, which are microtubule-associated molecular motors that transport intracellular cargo. KIF5B specifically is involved in the transport of organelles along microtubules.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 6342
- NCBI Entrez: 3798
- Ensembl: ENSG00000060642
- OMIM: 602591
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60282

Aliases: KNS2, NKHC, KIF5, KIF5beta

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several amino acid mutations known to occur in KIF5B:

|AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID|
|----------|--------------|---------|
| R17H | Missense | rs147919247 |
| D352A | Missense | rs201888582 |

| A632P | Missense | rs587782855 |
| S638P | Missense | rs769762327 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified in KIF5B in various cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma. Some of these are:

|SNV/InDel | dbSNP ID |
|----------|----------|
| c.437C>T | rs149940249 |
| c.1075C>G | rs139239418 |
| c.2426G>A | rs140233866 |

### Related Diseases:
KIF5B has been found to have gene fusions in various cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma, thyroid cancer and others.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The prognosis and treatment of KIF5B-related cancers vary depending on the specific cancer type and stage. However, targeting KIF5B gene fusions has shown promise in certain cases, such as the KIF5B-RET fusion in lung adenocarcinoma.

### Drug Response:
Several drugs have been identified that target the KIF5B-RET fusion and have shown efficacy in preclinical studies and clinical trials. These include selpercatinib (aka LOXO-292), pralsetinib (aka BLU-667), and others.
