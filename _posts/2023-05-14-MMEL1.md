# Information on Gene MMEL1 

## Genomic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genomic Position:** MMEL1 gene is located on chromosome 2q37.3.
- **Function for gene:** MMEL1 gene encodes the metalloprotease Neprilysin 2, which is involved in the degradation of neuropeptides.
- **Pathology:** Studies have shown that MMEL1 may be associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. 
- **Aliases:** The gene also goes by the name of Neprilysin-like protein 1.
