# Information about Gene PLS3

**Genetic Position:** PLS3 gene is located on chromosome X at position Xq23.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the PLS3 gene are associated with osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. They can also lead to low bone density and decreased bone mineralization.

**Function for Gene:** The PLS3 gene encodes plastin 3 protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the skeletal system. It is involved in actin bundling and stabilizes actin filaments. It also interacts with several proteins and enzymes that regulate bone formation and resorption.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the PLS3 gene are associated with osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options include calcium and vitamin D supplements, bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, and denosumab. The prognosis for patients with PLS3 mutations is generally good with appropriate treatment.

**Drug Response:** Patients with PLS3 mutations may respond differently to certain medications used to treat osteoporosis. Further research is needed to determine optimal treatment strategies for this patient population.
