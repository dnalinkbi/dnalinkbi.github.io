## Gene MLYCD

**Function for gene**: The MLYCD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown and utilization of fatty acids for energy production in the body.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**\
- p.A192T (rs61735270) - missense mutation
- p.E200K (rs61731856) - missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**\
No somatic mutations have been reported for this gene.

**Related disease**\
Deficiency of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase results in a rare autosomal recessive disorder called malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Symptoms include developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, and abnormal movements.

**Treatment and prognosis**\
There is no cure for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, but treatment involves management of symptoms. This includes the use of antiepileptic drugs for epileptic seizures, speech and occupational therapy for developmental delays, and dietary modifications to manage lipid metabolism abnormalities. 

**Drug response**\
There are currently no drugs specifically designed to target malonyl-CoA decarboxylase or its associated deficiency.
