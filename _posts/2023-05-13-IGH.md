# Information on Gene IGH

## Gene Information

- **Function for gene**: IGH encodes the immunoglobulin heavy chain protein, which is a crucial component of the adaptive immune system involved in recognizing and neutralizing foreign pathogens. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**:
The gene IGH is located on chromosome 14q32.33 in the human genome. The gene has several external IDs and aliases, including:

    - **HGNC**: 5392 (HGNC: Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1)
    - **NCBI Entrez**: 3490
    - **Ensembl**: ENSG00000211898
    - **OMIM**: 146940
    - **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P01871

## Genetic Mutations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Several amino acid mutations are reported in IGH. A few of them with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs are listed below:

        - R52C, Missense, rs55872279
        - T117S, Missense, rs121909861
        - A328G, Missense, rs104893996

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Somatic mutations in IGH are associated with various cancers, including lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with their dbSNP IDs are:

        - c.1249C>T, rs145151442
        - c.1579A>G, rs562029940
        - c.1709C>T, rs368502779
  
## Related Diseases

- **Related Diseases**: Mutations, translocations, and deregulation in IGH are associated with several diseases, including various types of cancer, primary immunodeficiency disorders, and autoimmune diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment and Prognosis**: The treatment and prognosis of IGH-related diseases depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the severity of the mutation, and the response to treatment. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.

## Drug Response

- **Drug Response**: Clinical studies have shown that patients with IGH mutations respond differently to various drugs. Certain drugs, such as immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors, have been found to be effective in treating multiple myeloma patients with IGH mutations.
