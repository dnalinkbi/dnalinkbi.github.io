### Related Diseases

- Mutations in EFHC1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic (EJM5) and rolandic epilepsy, mental retardation, and dysarthria (REMD).

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no specific treatment available for mutations in EFHC1 gene-associated diseases. Treatment options include antiepileptic drugs and supportive care.
- The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
