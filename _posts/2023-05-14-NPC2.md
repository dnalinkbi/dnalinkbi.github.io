# Gene: NPC2

## Information

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 14 (14q24.3)
- **Function**: This gene encodes for a protein called Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2), which is involved in the transport of cholesterol and other lipids inside the cell. 
- **Pathology**: Variations in this gene can cause Niemann-Pick disease type C2, an inherited condition characterized by abnormal lipid metabolism and accumulation of lipids in various organs of the body, leading to progressive neurological and visceral symptoms. 
- **Aliases**: NPC2, NCP2L

## External IDs

- **HGNC**: 7817
- **NCBI Entrez**: 10577
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000172269
- **OMIM**: 601015
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P61916

## Variation Information

- **AA Mutation List**: There are several mutations reported in the NPC2 gene, including p.Arg178Trp, p.Gly201Arg, p.Leu94Pro, and others.
- **Mutation Type**: Missense, frameshift, nonsense, and others.
- **dbSNP ID**: rs137852769, rs121908888

## Related Diseases

- Niemann-Pick disease type C2
- Hepatitis C virus infection
- Influenza A virus infection

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no cure for Niemann-Pick disease type C2, and treatment is mainly supportive, aimed at managing the symptoms of the disease. Some therapies that have been tried include enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, and gene therapy.
- The prognosis for this disease varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset.
- In hepatitis C virus and influenza A virus infections, targeting NPC2 has been shown to be a potential therapeutic strategy in preclinical studies.

## Drug Response

- Miglustat, a substrate reduction therapy drug, has been approved for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C2 in some countries.
- Other drugs that have been tested in preclinical studies for the treatment of this disease include hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin.
