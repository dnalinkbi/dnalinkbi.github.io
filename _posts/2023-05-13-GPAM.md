# Gene GPAM Information

## Genetic Position
The GPAM gene is located on chromosome 10 at position 10q24.31.

## Pathology and Function
The GPAM gene encodes for the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Mutations in the GPAM gene have been associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.
