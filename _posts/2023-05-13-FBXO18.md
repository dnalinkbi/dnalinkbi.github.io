## Gene FBXO18
- **Function for gene:** The FBXO18 gene encodes a member of F-box proteins which are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes by targeting specific proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein may also play a role in the DNA damage response pathway.
