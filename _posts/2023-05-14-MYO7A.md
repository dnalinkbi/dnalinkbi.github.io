## Gene Information

### Gene: MYO7A

### Pathology:

MYO7A gene mutations have been associated with several types of human diseases including non-syndromic hearing loss, Usher Syndrome, Retinitis Pigmentosa, and Bardet-Biedl Syndrome.

### Function:

The MYO7A gene encodes a protein that belongs to the myosin superfamily. It is expressed mainly in the retina, cochlea, and vestibular system. The protein is involved in several intracellular functions, such as cargo transport along actin filaments, organelle positioning, and endocytosis.

### External IDs and Genomic Location:

- HGNC ID: 7595
- NCBI Entrez: 4647
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135740
- OMIM: 276903
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13402
- Genomic Location: 11q13.5

### Aliases:

- DFNA11
- NSRD2
- USH1B

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| p.Arg634*   | nonsense      | rs1378529535 |
| p.Arg2468Ter | nonsense      | rs1378529539 |
| p.Val1984Ala | missense      | rs1378529542 |
| p.Val1492Met | missense      | rs1554292577 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

Currently, there is no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the MYO7A gene in diseases.

### Related Disease:

- Non-syndromic hearing loss
- Usher Syndrome
- Retinitis Pigmentosa
- Bardet-Biedl Syndrome

### Treatment and Prognosis:

Currently, there are no approved treatments for genetic disorders caused by MYO7A mutations. Management mainly focuses on symptom relief and hearing aids or cochlear implants for hearing loss.

### Drug Response:

Currently, there is no known drug response associated with MYO7A gene mutations.
