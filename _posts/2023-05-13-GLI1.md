# Information about gene GLI1

## Gene Information
- **Gene:** GLI1
- **Function:** The GLI1 gene encodes a transcriptional activator that plays a key role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in embryonic development and tissue patterning, as well as the maintenance of stem cells and the development of cancer.
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 4295
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 2735
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000171790
    - OMIM: 165220
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08151
- **Aliases:** GLI, GLI-1

## Genetic Position
- **Chromosome:** 12
- **Genomic Location:** 57,458,747-57,733,496

## Mutation Information
- **AA Mutation List:** 
    - p.D587N
    - p.L181F
    - p.V452V
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs117458488, rs150701555, rs373335502

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- **dbSNP ID:** rs1801163, rs2252586, rs2301620, rs34435917, rs373335502, rs62625035

## Related Diseases
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Medulloblastoma
- Rhabdomyosarcoma
- Acute myeloid leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no targeted therapy for GLI1 mutations or diseases associated with GLI1 dysregulation. 
- The prognosis for GLI1-related diseases varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation.

## Drug Response
- The GLI1 protein is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Several drugs are in development that target the Hedgehog signaling pathway, including vismodegib and sonidegib.
