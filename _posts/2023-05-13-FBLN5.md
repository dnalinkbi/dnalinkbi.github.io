# Information about gene FBLN5

**Genetic Position:** FBLN5 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14, specifically on the position 14q32.1.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the FBLN5 gene have been associated with various pathologies including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cutis laxa, and aortic aneurysm. 

**Function:** FBLN5 gene is responsible for producing a protein called Fibulin-5, which is a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue structure and elasticity.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC ID: 3617

**Related Diseases:** FBLN5 gene mutations have been associated with various conditions, including:
- Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
- Cutis Laxa
- Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA)
- Ascending Aortic Aneurysms (AAA)
- Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for FBLN5 gene-related pathologies. Standard treatments include medication to manage symptoms and surgery in severe cases. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

**Drug Response:** Currently, there is no specific drug available for the treatment of FBLN5 gene-related pathologies.
