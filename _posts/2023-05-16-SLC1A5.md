# Gene Information for SLC1A5 

## Gene Position 
SLC1A5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 19p13.3.

## Gene Function 
The SLC1A5 gene encodes for a neutral amino acid transporter that is primarily responsible for the import of glutamine into cells. Glutamine is an important amino acid that has many essential functions in the body, including being a major source of energy for rapidly dividing cells. 

## External IDs and Aliases 
- HGNC: 10917 
- NCBI Entrez: 6510 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000057593 
- OMIM: 600310 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15758 

Aliases for SLC1A5 include ASCT2, ATB0,+ and SATT. 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several mutations have been identified in the SLC1A5 gene. Below are some of the most common AA mutations and mutation types with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- L541P (rs147481081) 
- G401R (rs201284239) 
- K550N (rs147672497) 
- G324E (rs137853579) 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 
Several somatic mutations have been identified in the SLC1A5 gene. Below are some of the most common somatic mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- c.678T>A (rs560745739) 
- c.1246G>A (rs140792653) 
- c.1481C>T (rs746155407)

## Related Disease
SLC1A5 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a number of different types of cancer, including breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Additionally, changes in the expression of SLC1A5 have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.

## Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment and prognosis for SLC1A5-associated diseases depends on the specific disease and the individual case. In cancer, for example, different treatment options, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, may be used depending on the stage and location of the cancer. In neurodegenerative diseases, treatments are generally focused on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. In some cases, drugs that target SLC1A5 may be developed as a treatment option.

## Drug Response
Some studies have suggested that targeting SLC1A5 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for certain types of cancer. Several drugs that inhibit this transporter have been developed and are currently being studied in clinical trials. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential effects and side effects of these drugs.
