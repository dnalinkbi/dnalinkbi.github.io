# Information about Gene NF1

## Genetic Position
The gene NF1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 11.2 (17q11.2).

## Pathology
Mutations in the NF1 gene are associated with the development of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors on nerves in various parts of the body.

## Function for Gene
The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin. This protein helps regulate the activity of other proteins that promote cell growth and division. It acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the NF1 gene reduce the production or function of neurofibromin protein, leading to the development of tumors.

## Related Disease
The NF1 gene is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors on nerves in various parts of the body. Symptoms of NF1 may include caf√©-au-lait spots, skinfold freckling, bone deformities, and learning disabilities.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for neurofibromatosis type 1. Treatment options are focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Regular monitoring and screening may be recommended to detect and treat potential complications.

## Drug Response
There are currently no targeted therapies available for neurofibromatosis type 1. Treatment may involve surgery, radiation therapy, or drug therapy to manage symptoms.
