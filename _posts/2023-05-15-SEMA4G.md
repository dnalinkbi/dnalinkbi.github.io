## Information About Gene SEMA4G

### Genetic Position
The SEMA4G gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 11.21.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SEMA4G gene have been associated with various diseases, including prostate cancer, testicular germ cell tumors, and melanoma.

### Function
The SEMA4G gene encodes a member of the semaphorin protein family. Semaphorins are involved in cell signaling and play a role in axon guidance and immune response. The exact function of SEMA4G is not fully understood, but it is thought to be involved in regulating T-cell activation.
