## Gene Information
The gene TAS1R1 is located on chromosome 1 at position 1q32.1. It encodes for the taste receptor type 1 member 1 protein which is a receptor involved in the perception of sweet and umami flavors.

## Function
The TAS1R1 protein forms a heterodimeric complex with TAS1R3 to create a sweet and umami taste receptor. Together, they are responsible for the detection and perception of sweet and umami tastes.
