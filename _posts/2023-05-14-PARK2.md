# Information about Gene PARK2

## Gene Position
- The PARK2 gene is located on chromosome 6 (6q25.2-q27)

## Pathology and Function
- PARK2 is associated with parkinsonism, which is characterized by tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Mutations in this gene are responsible for autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) also known as Parkinson's disease type 2 (PD2).
- PARK2 encodes the protein Parkin, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is involved in protein degradation pathways, particularly of damaged or misfolded proteins.

## External IDs and Aliases

- Aliases: LPRS2, PDJ

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with PARK2.

## Related Disease
- Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) also known as Parkinson's disease type 2 (PD2)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for PD2 typically involves levodopa therapy for symptom management.
- Prognosis for PD2 can vary, but the disease generally progresses more slowly than other forms of Parkinson's disease.

## Drug Response
- Patients with PD2 have been found to have a good response to levodopa therapy.
