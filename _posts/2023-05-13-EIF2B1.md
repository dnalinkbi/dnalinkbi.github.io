# Gene EIF2B1

### Genetic Position
Gene EIF2B1 is located on chromosome 12 at position 12q24.31.

### Pathology
Mutations in EIF2B1 gene are responsible for a disorder called Leukodystrophy, Chinese Type. It is an inherited disorder in which there is a degeneration of white matter in the brain.

### Function
EIF2B1 gene encodes a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2B (EIF2B) that plays a critical role in regulating protein synthesis. EIF2B1 is essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system.

### Related Disease
Leukodystrophy, Chinese Type is a rare genetic disorder that affects the white matter in the brain leading to neurological problems.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Leukodystrophy, Chinese Type. Treatment aims at managing symptoms and providing support to patients. Prognosis is poor as the disease is progressive and eventually fatal.

### Drug Response
No drugs have been specifically approved for the treatment of Leukodystrophy, Chinese Type. Symptomatic treatment includes antiepileptic drugs, muscle relaxants, physical therapy, and supportive care.
