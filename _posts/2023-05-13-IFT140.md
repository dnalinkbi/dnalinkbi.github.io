## Gene: IFT140

### Information:

Gene IFT140 is located on chromosome 16q22.3 and encodes for the intraflagellar transport protein 140. This protein is essential for the formation and maintenance of cilia and flagella, which are organelles involved in cellular signaling and motility. 

**Function:** Encodes for one of the subunits of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, which is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in most cell types.

**External IDs and Aliases:** HGNC: 16513, NCBI Entrez Gene: 57551, Ensembl: ENSG00000131591, OMIM: 610162, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q5T4F4.

**Mutation information:**
- AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID: No known amino acid mutations.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: No known somatic mutations. 

**Related diseases:** IFT140 mutations have been associated with a variety of genetic disorders, including Jeune syndrome, or asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, cranioectodermal dysplasia, and short-rib thoracic dysplasia. 

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for disorders associated with IFT140 mutations is primarily symptom-based. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder. 

**Drug response:** No known drug response
