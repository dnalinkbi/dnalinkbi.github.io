# Information about Gene FANCC

## Genetic Position
The FANCC gene is located on chromosome 9q22.3.

## Pathology
The FANCC gene is associated with the development of Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and an increased risk of cancer.

## Function
The FANCC gene encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability. It is a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group, which plays a critical role in the repair of DNA crosslinks.
