## Gene information on GNB3
- **Function for gene:** The GNB3 gene encodes the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, which has a crucial function in signal transduction from the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular effectors. 
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
    - Gene ID: 2784
    - Genomic location: chromosome 12p13.3
    - Aliases: G protein subunit beta 3, guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(T) subunit beta-3
