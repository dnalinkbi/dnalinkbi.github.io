# Gene Information for SLC19A2

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- SLC19A2 is located on chromosome 1p32.3
- It is a member of the SLC19 family of transporters and is responsible for the transport of thiamine (vitamin B1) across cell membranes.
- Mutations in SLC19A2 are associated with a genetic disorder called Thiamine-Responsive Megaloblastic Anemia Syndrome (TRMA), which is characterized by anemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness.
- The pathology of TRMA is caused by a defect in the SLC19A2 transporter which impairs the uptake of thiamine from dietary sources.

## Function for Gene

- SLC19A2 encodes a thiamine transporter that is vital for the uptake of thiamine from dietary sources and its subsequent distribution throughout the body.
- Thiamine is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including energy metabolism, neuronal function, and the synthesis of nucleic acids.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is no information available for Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease

- Thiamine-Responsive Megaloblastic Anemia Syndrome (TRMA)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for TRMA involves high doses of thiamine supplementation to overcome the impaired thiamine uptake.
- With early and proper treatment, the prognosis for TRMA can be good.

## Drug Response

- There is limited information available regarding drug response related to SLC19A2 mutations.
