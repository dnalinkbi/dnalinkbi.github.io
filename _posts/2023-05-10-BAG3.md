# Information about Gene BAG3

## Genetic Position 
BAG3 (BCL2 Associated Athanogene 3) is located on Chromosome 10, specifically at the locus 10q26.11.

## Pathology 
BAG3 mutations have been implicated in several diseases such as myofibrillar myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy. These diseases are characterized by defective protein degradation and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells.

## Function for gene 
BAG3 is a co-chaperone protein that functions to regulate protein quality control and the degradation of damaged proteins. It acts as a mediator between the chaperone HSP70 and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which targets the damaged proteins for degradation. BAG3 is also involved in apoptosis and autophagy, processes important for normal functioning of cells.

## Related Disease 
- Myofibrillar Myopathy
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy
- Neuropathy

## Treatment and Prognosis 
As of current knowledge, there is no specific cure or treatment for BAG3-related diseases. But therapies that help in reducing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease have been developed, such as physical therapy, drug treatment, and surgery.

## Drug Response
Recently, a small molecule drug named YM-01 that targets the BAG3 protein stabilizing the disease misregulated proteins has been successful in cell and animal models, and currently, YM-01 is being tested in clinical trials for human use.
