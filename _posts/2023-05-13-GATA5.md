# Gene GATA5 

## Genetic Position
The GATA5 gene is located on the short arm of human chromosome 20 (20p12.2). It spans about 38 kilobases (kb) of genomic DNA and contains 6 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GATA5 gene have been associated with various congenital heart defects, including atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, pulmonary valve stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Some studies have also suggested that GATA5 mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

## Function
GATA5 encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in heart development, particularly in the formation and differentiation of the heart valves. It also regulates the expression of various genes involved in endoderm development, gut, and lung epithelial differentiation.

- Congenital heart defects, including atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, pulmonary valve stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot
- Colorectal cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment or cure for GATA5-related disorders. Management options depend on the severity and type of congenital heart defects present. Surgery may be required to repair the affected heart structures. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the defects and the promptness of diagnosis and treatment.

## Drug Response
No information available.
