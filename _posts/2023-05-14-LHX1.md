## Gene LHX1

### Genetic position
The LHX1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q13.1).

### Pathology
Mutations in LHX1 are associated with multiple congenital anomalies affecting the kidney and urinary tract (MCAKUT) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by malformations of the kidneys, urinary tract, and genitalia. 

### Function
LHX1 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for normal kidney and urinary tract development during embryonic development. It is involved in the differentiation of the metanephric mesenchyme into the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney.

### Related disease
Multiple congenital anomalies affecting the kidney and urinary tract syndrome (MCAKUT)

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for MCAKUT syndrome and treatment is based on the presenting symptoms. Patients may require surgery or supportive therapies to manage renal failure and urinary tract obstruction. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the malformations.

### Drug response
No information is available on the drug response of LHX1 mutations.
