## Gene: PIM1
- Function: PIM1 belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and signaling pathways related to cell survival. This gene has a crucial role in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, and its overexpression has been reported in various human malignancies.

- Related disease: PIM1 has been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer, including lymphomas, leukemias, solid tumors of the breast, colon, lung, and pancreas.
- Treatment and prognosis: PIM1 inhibitors have shown promising results in preclinical studies as anticancer agents. However, the clinical benefit of PIM1 inhibitors in cancer patients is yet to be established. High expression of PIM1 has been associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers.
- Drug response: Several PIM1 inhibitors are currently in preclinical development or undergoing clinical trials, including CX6258, AZD1208, and SGI-1776.
