# Gene F10: 

The F10 gene, also known as coagulation factor X, is located on chromosome 13q34 and encodes a protein that plays an essential role in the coagulation cascade. 

## Function: 
It functions as a serine protease that converts prothrombin to thrombin, which ultimately leads to the formation of a fibrin clot.

## Related Disease: 
Deficiency in factor X is a rare bleeding disorder that can result in excessive bleeding following an injury or surgery. It can also lead to spontaneous bruising and bleeding in some individuals. 

## Treatment and Prognosis: 
Replacement therapy with factor X concentrate can effectively treat bleeding episodes in individuals with factor X deficiency. The long-term prognosis is generally good with appropriate treatment. 

## Drug Response: 
Various anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin and rivaroxaban, target factor X to prevent clot formation and treat or prevent thromboembolic events.
