## Gene Name: MYLK2

### Function
MYLK2 (Myosin Light Chain Kinase 2) encodes a protein that belongs to the myosin light chain kinase family. The protein plays a role in smooth muscle contraction and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, it also plays a role in cardiac development and function.

### Related Disease
MYLK2 is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition where the heart becomes enlarged and weakened. Other than that, MYLK2 mutations have also been linked with other cardiovascular conditions such as atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

### Treatment and Prognosis
As of now, there is no specific treatment for MYLK2-related cardiomyopathy or other related cardiovascular conditions. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive, depending on the patient's condition. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's response to treatment. 

### Drug Response
No known drug response has been reported for MYLK2 mutations.
