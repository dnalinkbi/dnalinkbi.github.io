# Information about CYLD Gene 

## Genetic Position
The CYLD gene is located on chromosome 16q12.1 and spans 58.29 kb.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CYLD gene have been associated with several diseases, including familial cylindromatosis, multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and Brooke-Spiegler syndrome.

## Function
The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates several signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JNK, and Wnt. The protein plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

All somatic changes listed above are located in intronic regions of the CYLD gene.

## Related Disease
The CYLD gene is associated with familial cylindromatosis, multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. These diseases are characterized by the development of benign skin tumors, typically on the head and neck.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no targeted therapies for CYLD-related diseases. Treatment options include surgical removal of tumors and cosmetic procedures to improve appearance. The prognosis for affected individuals is generally good, though recurrence of tumors is common.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available regarding drug response in individuals with CYLD-related diseases.
