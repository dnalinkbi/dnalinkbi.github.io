## Gene: LAMA2

- Function: 
LAMA2 is a gene that encodes laminin alpha-2 protein, which is a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve, and skin. The protein plays a crucial role in muscle fiber stability, synaptic function at neuromuscular junctions, and peripheral nerve cell viability.

- External IDs and Genomic location: 
    - HGNC ID: 6482 
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163888 
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 3909 
    - Genomic Position: Chromosome 6:31115417-31374581 
    - Aliases: MDC1A, LAMA2A, LAMA2B

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - LAMA2 gene has been found to be linked with various mutations resulting in diseases such as congenital muscular dystrophy, merosin-deficient type 1A (MDC1A), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.
    - Some of the AA mutations reported in the LAMA2 gene are p.(G1137Vfs*14), p.(T1820P), p.(T1961P), and p.(D2875H).
    - dbSNP ID: rs776607143, rs80338999, rs80339000, rs141510597, etc.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - LAMA2 somatic mutations have also been reported in various cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, etc.
    - Some of the somatic mutations in LAMA2 gene reported in the COSMIC database are c.1912C>T, c.11291C>T, c.280T>G, c.1978T>C, etc.
    - dbSNP ID: rs1557539, rs767569832, rs139040697, rs534876905, etc.

- Related disease:
Mutations in the LAMA2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including:
    - Congenital muscular dystrophy, merosin-deficient type 1A (MDC1A)
    - Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type R9 (LGMDR9)
    - Muscular dystrophy, congenital, merosin-positive and -negative
    - Walker-Warburg syndrome
    - Muscular Dystrophy-Dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies)

- Treatment and prognosis: 
Currently, there is no cure for MDC1A disease. Treatment is mainly supportive and may include physical therapy, orthopedic devices, respiratory support and, in some cases, surgical interventions such as spinal fusion. 
The prognosis for individuals with MDC1A disease varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

- Drug response: 
Various drugs are under investigation for the treatment of muscular dystrophy, including gene therapy, exon skipping therapy, and protein replacement therapies. Currently, there is no targeted treatment available for LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, but supportive treatments can improve the patient's quality of life.
