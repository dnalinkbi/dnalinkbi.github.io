## Information about gene SLC26A5

### Genetic position

SLC26A5 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q22.3), spanning ~28 kb of genomic DNA.

### Pathology

Mutations in the SLC26A5 gene have been associated with sensorineural deafness, and in particular with the autosomal-recessive form.

### Function

The SLC26A5 gene encodes the prestin protein, which is highly expressed in outer hair cells of the cochlea and plays a crucial role in hearing by enhancing outer hair cell motility.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the SLC26A5 gene.

### Related disease

Sensorineural deafness (autosomal-recessive).

### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for sensorineural deafness usually involves hearing aids and cochlear implants, which can greatly improve hearing ability.

### Drug response

No specific drug response information is available for SLC26A5 gene mutations.
