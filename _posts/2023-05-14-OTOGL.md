## Gene Information
Gene: OTOGL

### Pathology
OTOGl is associated with otosclerosis and hearing loss.

### Function 
OTOGl encodes a protein that is a member of the otogelin family, which are involved in hearing and balance. OTOGl is crucial for normal development of the auditory and vestibular systems.
