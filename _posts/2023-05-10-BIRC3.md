## Gene BIRC3

### Genetic Position and Pathology

The BIRC3 gene is located on chromosome 11q22 and is associated with various diseases such as lymphoma, leukemia, and solid tumors.

### Function

BIRC3 encodes a protein known as inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) which inhibits programmed cell death or apoptosis. It also plays a crucial role in various cellular processes such as inflammation and immune response.

### Related Disease

BIRC3 mutations are associated with various diseases such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

BIRC3 mutations can confer resistance to therapy, which can affect prognosis. Targeted therapies such as BCL-2 inhibitors have shown promising results in treating BIRC3-mutated DLBCL.

### Drug Response

BIRC3-mutated cancers have shown potential response to BCL-2 inhibitors such as venetoclax.
