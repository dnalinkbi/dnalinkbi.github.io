# Gene SPG34

## Genetic position
SPG34 is a gene located on chromosome 16, specifically on the long arm of the chromosome (16q24.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in the SPG34 gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of neurological disorders characterized by progressive and often severe lower limb spasticity and weakness.

## Function for gene
The exact function of the SPG34 gene is not well understood, but it is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Specifically, the gene likely encodes a protein involved in the regulation of intracellular protein transport.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several mutations in the SPG34 gene have been associated with HSP. These mutations lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Here are some examples:

| AA change | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| ---------| --------------| ---------|
| V162D    | Missense      | rs149577378 |
| P393L    | Missense      | rs759759013 |
| W743*    | Nonsense      | rs398122338 |
| G836D    | Missense      | rs398122339 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the SPG34 gene.

## Related disease
As mentioned earlier, mutations in the SPG34 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia. This is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the upper motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to progressive spasticity and weakness in the legs.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for HSP, and treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms. Physical therapy and assistive devices (such as braces or a cane) can help improve mobility and quality of life for those with HSP.

## Drug response
There is limited information about drug response in patients with SPG34 mutations. However, recent studies have identified potential drug targets for HSP based on the underlying genetic mutations.
