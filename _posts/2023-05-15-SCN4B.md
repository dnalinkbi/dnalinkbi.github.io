## **Information about gene SCN4B**

### **Genetic Position**
The SCN4B gene is located on chromosome 11q23.3.

### **Pathology**
Pathogenic variants in the SCN4B gene have been associated with various neuromuscular disorders such as potassium-aggravated myotonia, paramyotonia congenita, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and congenital myasthenic syndrome.

### **Function**
The SCN4B gene encodes for the beta-4 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel complex. This protein is important in regulating the function of the alpha subunit, which mediates the influx of sodium ions and is responsible for action potential propagation in nerve cells and skeletal muscles.

The mutation type for all the above mutations is Missense and each mutation has a corresponding dbSNP ID.

### **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
There are no reported somatic mutations for this gene.

### **Related Disease**
Pathogenic variants in the SCN4B gene have been associated with various neuromuscular disorders such as potassium-aggravated myotonia, paramyotonia congenita, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and congenital myasthenic syndrome.

### **Treatment and Prognosis**
Treatment options for these neuromuscular disorders are symptomatic and supportive. Some patients may experience spontaneous remission, while in others the symptoms may worsen. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

### **Drug Response**
There is limited information available regarding drug response in relation to SCN4B gene mutations.
