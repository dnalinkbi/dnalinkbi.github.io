## Gene INPPL1

- **Function for gene**: INPPL1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to regulate the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. It is involved in multiple cellular processes including insulin signaling, glucose homeostasis, and regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation.

   - c.2473C>T (p.Arg825Trp), missense, rs72555377
   - c.1549G>A (p.Arg517Gln), missense, rs202124451
   - c.1399G>A (p.Arg467His), missense, rs72555379
   
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported
   
- **Related disease**: Mutations in INPPL1 have been associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in humans. 
   
- **Treatment and prognosis**: The treatment and prognosis depends on the specific disease or condition associated with INPPL1 mutations. For example, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome may be treated with lifestyle modifications, medication, and/or insulin therapy.
   
- **Drug response**: INPPL1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Small molecule inhibitors targeting INPPL1 have shown promise in preclinical studies.
