## MYH2 Gene

### Information

- Gene name: MYH2
- Function: This gene encodes a myosin II heavy chain protein which is involved in muscle contraction. It is specifically expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers.
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17, q12
- Aliases: Myosin, heavy polypeptide 2, skeletal muscle, adult

### External IDs

- HGNC: 7575
- NCBI Entrez: 4620
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108781
- OMIM: 160740
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35580

### Related Disease

- This gene is associated with Congenital myopathy with fiber-type disproportion, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting.

### Treatment and prognosis

- There is no specific treatment for MYH2-related disease. The management of symptoms includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and the use of assistive devices.

### Drug response

- There is no information available regarding drug response for MYH2-related disease.
