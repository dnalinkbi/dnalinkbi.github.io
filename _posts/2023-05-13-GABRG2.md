# Information about gene GABRG2

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: 5
- Genomic coordinates: 75,874,559 - 75,892,641
- Strand: minus

## Pathology
GABRG2 is associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.

## Function for gene
GABRG2 encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit, which is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel family. This receptor plays a crucial role in the inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, modulating neuronal excitability.

## Related disease
- Epilepsy, childhood absence 3
- Alcohol dependence
- Autism 16
- Schizophrenia 15
- Drug addiction

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for GABRG2-related disorders vary depending on the specific disease and presentation. Epilepsy can often be managed with medication, while autism and schizophrenia require more comprehensive interventions including behavioral therapies and medication. Substance use disorders may require addiction-specific treatment.

## Drug response
Studies have shown that mutations in GABRG2 can impact an individual's response to certain drugs, including benzodiazepines.
