# Gene CDKN2A

CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) is a tumor suppressor gene located on Chromosome 9p21.3. Its protein product is a negative regulator of the cell cycle, inhibiting the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and effectively halting the progression of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. 

## Function

CDKN2A plays a crucial role in regulating cell division and preventing uncontrolled growth and division of cells. Mutations in this gene can disrupt the regulation of the cell cycle and lead to the development of cancer.

- dbSNP ID: rs141591784, rs867118, rs786437048

## Related Diseases

- CDKN2A mutations have been strongly associated with increased risk for melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome.
- Other cancers associated with CDKN2A mutations include lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and glioblastoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- CDKN2A mutations may confer sensitivity to targeted therapies, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors.
- Prognosis may vary depending on the type and location of the cancer and the specific mutation within CDKN2A.

## Drug Response

- CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, have shown promise in treating CDKN2A-mutant cancers.
