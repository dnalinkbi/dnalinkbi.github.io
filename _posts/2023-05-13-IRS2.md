# Gene IRS2

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 13q34, Position 112,185,498-112,267,257

**Pathology**: Mutations in the IRS2 gene are associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and certain types of cancer.

**Function**: The IRS2 gene encodes insulin receptor substrate 2, which is involved in mediating insulin signaling and glucose uptake in the body. It plays a key role in regulating glucose metabolism in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, and also has a role in promoting cell growth and survival.

**External IDs**:
- HGNC: 6098
- NCBI Entrez: 8660
- Ensembl: ENSG00000170476
- OMIM: 600797
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y4H2

**Aliases**: IRS-2, insulin receptor substrate 2, pp185

**AA Mutation List**:
- R586C (rs12931201)
- G1057D (rs1805097)
- G1057V (rs1805098)

**Mutation Type**: Missense

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
- rs12045830
- rs55643097
- rs55651252

**Related Diseases**: Insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Cancer (especially breast and prostate cancer)

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no cure for insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, but medications such as metformin can help improve insulin sensitivity. For polycystic ovarian syndrome, treatment options include birth control pills, metformin, and anti-androgens. For cancer, treatment options vary depending on the type and stage of the disease.

**Drug Response**: Some studies suggest that certain genetic variants in the IRS2 gene may affect response to metformin or other diabetes medications.
