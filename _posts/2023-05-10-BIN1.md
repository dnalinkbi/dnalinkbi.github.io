## Information about Gene BIN1

### Genetic Position
The BIN1 gene is located on chromosome 2, at the position 2q14.3.

### Pathology
BIN1 gene is associated with several diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In Alzheimer's, BIN1 gene regulates Tau protein and is involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. 

### Function for Gene
The BIN1 gene encodes an adapter protein called amphiphysin 2, which is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles in the presynaptic terminals of neurons. It regulates endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release.

### Related Disease
- Alzheimer's disease 
- Parkinson's disease 

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatments can help manage symptoms. Some treatments that target the BIN1 gene may help in slowing down the progression of the disease.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug that currently targets BIN1 gene, but research is ongoing to develop such drugs.
