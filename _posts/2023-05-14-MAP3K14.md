# Information about gene MAP3K14

## Genetic Position
The MAP3K14 gene is located on the human chromosome 17q21.31.

## Pathology
MAP3K14 has been associated with the development and progression of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and esophageal cancers. Studies have also shown its involvement in inflammation, immune response, and cell differentiation.

## Function
The MAP3K14 gene encodes a protein called Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14, or MAP3K14. This protein is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, which is involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. MAP3K14 specifically activates MAPK pathways, including p38, JNK, and NF-ÎºB, in response to different stimuli such as stress, cytokines, and pathogens.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
One known mutation in the MAP3K14 gene is L194F, which is a missense mutation that results in a change in amino acid from leucine to phenylalanine at position 194. This mutation has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

dbSNP ID: rs773926761

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations in MAP3K14 have been identified in various cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers. Examples of such mutations are:
- c.1511G>A (p.Gly504Ser)
- c.1746C>G (p.Tyr582X)
- c.655C>T (p.Arg219Cys)

dbSNP IDs: rs146473403, rs141296037, rs143862717

## Related Diseases
MAP3K14 has been linked to several diseases, including:
- Cancer (breast, ovarian, lung, esophageal)
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Alzheimer's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for MAP3K14-related diseases. However, various inhibitors of MAPK pathways, including p38 and JNK, are being developed and tested in clinical trials for cancer and inflammatory diseases.

Prognosis depends on the type and stage of the disease associated with MAP3K14 dysregulation.

## Drug Response
Drugs targeting MAPK pathways, including p38 and JNK inhibitors, have shown promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials for cancer and inflammatory diseases.
