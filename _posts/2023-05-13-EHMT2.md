## Gene: EHMT2 [euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2]

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 6
- Genomic Location: 6p21.3
- Start position: 42,358,738 bp
- End position: 42,541,072 bp

### Pathology:
EHMT2 dysfunction has been linked to several diseases, including:
- Kleefstra syndrome [OMIM: 610253]
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Schizophrenia

### Function:
EHMT2 is a histone methyltransferase which maintains epigenetic silencing by methylating histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9). It also plays a crucial role in early embryonic development.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000124608
- NCBI Entrez ID: 10919
- OMIM ID: 607001
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9H9B1

### AA Mutation and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- c.2317C>T (p.Arg773Ter) with dbSNP ID: rs797044284

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.190G>A (p.Gly64Asp) with dbSNP ID: rs550166967

- c.748C>T (p.Leu250Phe) with dbSNP ID: rs572455646

### Related Diseases:
- Kleefstra Syndrome [OMIM: 610253]
- Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Schizophrenia

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no specific treatment for EHMT2-related diseases, and prognosis varies depending on the severity and extent of the symptoms.

### Drug Response:
There is no known drug response for EHMT2-related diseases.
