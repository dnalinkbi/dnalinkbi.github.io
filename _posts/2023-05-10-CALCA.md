## Gene Information for CALCA

**Function:** CALCA encodes a precursor peptide that is cleaved to produce multiple active peptides, including Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Calcitonin (CT), and Katacalcin. These peptides have various functions, such as regulating blood calcium levels, modulating pain perception, and controlling appetite.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 1411
- NCBI Entrez: 796
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163932
- OMIM: 114130
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01258

CALCA is located on chromosome 11q23.

**Aliases:** 
- CGRP
- CALC1
- CGRP1
- CT
- KC

**AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID**

No pathogenic amino acid mutations have been reported for CALCA.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

Several somatic SNVs have been reported for CALCA in various types of cancer, including breast, liver, colon, and lung cancers. However, none of these SNVs have been assigned dbSNP IDs.

**Related Disease:**

CALCA has been associated with several diseases, including migraine, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and various types of cancer.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Treatment for diseases associated with CALCA varies depending on the condition. For example, CGRP antagonists are effective in treating migraines. However, the prognosis for diseases associated with CALCA is generally poor, especially in cases of advanced cancer.

**Drug Response:**

CGRP antagonists, such as fremanezumab and galcanezumab, are used to treat migraines by blocking the effects of CGRP.
