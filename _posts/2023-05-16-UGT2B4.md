## Gene: UGT2B4

### Pathology
- UGT2B4 is a gene encoding the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, which is responsible for metabolizing and eliminating various drugs, xenobiotics, and endogenous compounds from the body.
- Mutations in UGT2B4 have been associated with certain types of cancer, including prostate cancer and lung cancer.

### Function
- The UGT2B4 gene is involved in the glucuronidation pathway, which plays an important role in drug metabolism and elimination.
- Specifically, UGT2B4 is responsible for glucuronidating small lipophilic compounds such as sterol hormones and bile acids.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- There are several AA mutations that have been reported in the UGT2B4 gene:
    - K92T (rs1042640)
    - A218G (rs45511401)
    - T237P (rs149574024)
    - C350Y (rs72551361)
    - A456P (rs74381856)
- These mutations are missense mutations, resulting in a single amino acid change in the UGT2B4 protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels that have been reported in the UGT2B4 gene:
    - rs11568658
    - rs62049524
    - rs141060145
- These SNVs/InDels are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and other types of cancer.

### Related Disease
- UGT2B4 mutations have been associated with various diseases, including:
    - Prostate cancer
    - Lung cancer
    - Breast cancer
    - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no targeted therapy for UGT2B4 mutations.
- Treatment and prognosis will depend on the specific disease and stage at diagnosis.

### Drug Response
- UGT2B4 mutations may affect the metabolism and elimination of certain drugs, potentially leading to altered drug response and toxicity.
