## Gene: DDHD2

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- Located on chromosome 8 (8q24.3)
- Pathology: Mutations in DDHD2 are implicated in spastic paraplegia 54, an inherited neurological disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. 
- Function: DDHD2 has been shown to be involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular trafficking.
