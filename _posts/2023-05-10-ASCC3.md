## Gene: ASCC3

ASCC3 is a gene that is located on chromosome 2 (2p16.1). It encodes for a protein called activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 3, which plays a role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. 

**Function:** The ASCC3 protein is a subunit of the ASC-1 complex, which is involved in transcriptional coactivation and belongs to the superfamily of DEAD/H-box helicases. It has been shown to be involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and plays a role in embryonic development.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000005020
- OMIM ID: 606367
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8IVW5
- Other aliases: ASC1, ASC-1, TRIP4, hASCC3, KIAA0056

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
There are several AA mutations reported in ASCC3 gene, which are listed on COSMIC database. Here are some of them:
- c.5136G>T (p.Glu1712Ter) - truncating mutation
- c.2674G>A (p.Glu892Lys) - missense mutation
- c.5413C>T (p.Leu1805Phe) - missense mutation
- c.3961A>T (p.Ile1321Phe) - missense mutation
- c.175G>T (p.Gly59Trp) - missense mutation
- dbSNP IDs have not been reported for these mutations.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
The following somatic mutations have been reported for ASCC3 gene:
- rs202097840 - missense mutation (p.Arg841Cys)
- rs774726699 - missense mutation (p.Ile1804Ser)
- rs796414703 - missense mutation (p.Arg924His)

**Related diseases:** There is limited evidence linking ASCC3 mutations to specific diseases, however some studies have shown potential associations with the following diseases:
- Intellectual disability 
- Microcephaly
- Seizure disorder
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy

**Treatment and prognosis:** As of now, there are no specific treatments for diseases associated with ASCC3 mutations. The prognosis for affected individuals varies depending on the specific disease phenotype.

**Drug response:** No specific drug response information has been reported for ASCC3 mutations.
