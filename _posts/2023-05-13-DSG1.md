# Information about gene DSG1

## Genetic Position
The DSG1 gene is located on chromosome 18 at the position 12.1.

## Pathology
DSG1 (Desmoglein-1) gene is associated with skin diseases such as pemphigus foliaceus and atopic dermatitis.


## Function for gene
The DSG1 gene encodes desmoglein-1 protein which plays a crucial role in the formation of desmosomes which are essential for epidermal integrity and cohesion.
