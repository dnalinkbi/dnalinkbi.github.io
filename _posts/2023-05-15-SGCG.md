# Gene SGCG

## Genetic Position

The gene SGCG (Sarcoglycan gamma) is located on the short arm of chromosome 13 (13q12).

## Pathology

Mutations in SGCG gene can cause autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C) or a milder form called LGMD2D. These conditions lead to muscle weakness and wasting, especially in the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles.

## Function

The SGCG gene provides instructions for making a protein called sarcoglycan gamma. This protein is part of a group of proteins called sarcoglycans, which work together to form a larger protein complex called the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. This complex is important for maintaining the structure and function of muscle fibers.

## Related Disease

- Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C)
- Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D (LGMD2D)

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for LGMD2C or LGMD2D, and treatment generally focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. This can include physical therapy, respiratory support, and assistive devices like wheelchairs or braces. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition, but it generally involves progressive muscle weakness and disability.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug or treatment that can cure or reverse LGMD2C or LGMD2D, but some drugs like corticosteroids and immunosuppressants may help manage symptoms.
