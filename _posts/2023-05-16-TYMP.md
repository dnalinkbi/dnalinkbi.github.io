# Gene Information for TYMP

## Gene Function
TYMP (Thymidine Phosphorylase) is an enzyme that is responsible for cell metabolism. The protein encoded by this gene converts thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate, which are precursors for DNA synthesis and repair. Additionally, TYMP also plays a role in angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation and migration.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the TYMP gene are associated with several diseases, including:
- Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) 
- Miller Fisher syndrome 
- Neuropathy, hereditary sensory, type IE (HSN1E)
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for diseases caused by TYMP mutations. Treatment options are mainly supportive and include symptom management, physical therapy, and nutritional support. The prognosis for individuals with MNGIE is poor, often leading to death within a few years after diagnosis.

## Drug Response
One study has shown that treatment with uridine, a precursor of thymidine, can improve the symptoms in MNGIE patients. Additionally, some patients have shown improvement with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
