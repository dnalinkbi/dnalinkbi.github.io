# ***Information about Gene ADCK3***

## Introduction
ADCK3 is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein, which is involved in power generation in cells.

## Function for Gene
The protein produced by ADCK3 gene named "AarF domain-containing kinase 3" is a member of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis pathway. It is an essential enzyme for synthesis of lipids, electron transport chain and energy production.

## Related Disease
- Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-10 (SCAR10)
- Coenzyme Q10 deficiency syndrome
    
## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for Coenzyme Q10 deficiency syndrome. However, it can be treated with oral administration of CoQ10 supplements. The prognosis for SCAR10 patients is not good because the disease is progressive and currently no viable therapy is available.   
    
## Drug response
No specific drug has been identified for the treatment of CoQ10 deficiency syndrome and SCAR10.
