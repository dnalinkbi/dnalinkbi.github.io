## Gene: IRF1

IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a gene located on Chromosome 5q31.1. Its protein product regulates the expression of interferon-alpha and -beta genes and plays an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity.

### Function
IRF1 regulates the expression of various cytokines and immune response genes, including IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. It also participates in cell growth regulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis.

### Related Diseases
IRF1 plays a critical role in various diseases, including viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Promoter polymorphisms of IRF1 are associated with the risk of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and decreased IRF1 expression levels are related to an increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Loss of IRF1 in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy.

### Treatment and Prognosis
IRF1 is considered a promising therapeutic target for various diseases. Clinical studies have shown that the upregulation of IRF1 expression can improve the prognosis of patients with various cancers, including prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer.

### Drug Response
IRF1 has been reported to be involved in the response to various drugs, including interferons, chemotherapeutic agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
