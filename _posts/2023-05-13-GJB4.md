## Gene GJB4

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Genomic coordinates: 1p34.3
- Strand orientation: plus strand

### Pathology
GJB4 gene mutations have been associated with skin diseases, including erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) and autosomal dominant progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia (PSEK).

### Function
The GJB4 gene encodes a protein called connexin 30.3, which is a member of the connexin family of proteins. Connexin 30.3 forms gap junctions that allow for intercellular communication between keratinocytes in the skin.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly2Val, missense variant, dbSNP: rs80338933
- p.Gly11Arg, missense variant, dbSNP: rs80338934
- p.Gly12Arg, missense variant, dbSNP: rs80338935
- p.Asn14Tyr, missense variant, dbSNP: rs80338936

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic mutations in the GJB4 gene have been reported.

### Related Disease
- Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV)
- Autosomal dominant progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia (PSEK)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for EKV or PSEK. Treatment options include topical therapies, oral retinoids, and laser therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the specific type and severity of the condition.

### Drug Response
No specific drug response information is available for GJB4 mutations.
