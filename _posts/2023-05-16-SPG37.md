## Gene: SPG37

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: q32.1

### Pathology
- SPG37 is associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), which is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by lower extremity spasticity and weakness.

### Function
- SPG37 encodes the protein KIAA0196, which is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and axonal transport.
