# Genetic Information for Gene AANAT

## Gene Position

The AANAT gene is located on chromosome 17q25.1 and spans 10 kilobases. It contains 6 exons and encodes the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase enzyme. 

## Gene Function

The AANAT gene encodes for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of melatonin. The melatonin hormone is essential in regulating circadian rhythm and sleep/wake cycles in mammals.

## Gene External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: 188
- NCBI Gene ID: 15
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000108551
- OMIM ID: 600950
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P49677
- Other Aliases: SNAT, Serotonin N-acetyltransferase, Tryptophan arylalkylamidase, Tryptophan-N-acetyltransferase

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the AANAT gene have been linked to sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase syndrome and non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for AANAT-related sleep disorders. Management typically involves good sleep hygiene practices and the use of melatonin supplements.

## Drug Response

Melatonin supplements have shown to be effective in treating sleep disorders associated with mutations in the AANAT gene.
