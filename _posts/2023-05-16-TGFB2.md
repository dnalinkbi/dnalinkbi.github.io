# Information about gene TGFB2

## Genetic Position
- Gene: TGFB2 (Transforming growth factor beta 2)
- Chromosome: 1
- Start position: 113,772,587 bp
- End position: 113,782,935 bp

## Pathology and Function
- TGFB2 is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and other physiological processes.
- Dysregulated expression of TGFB2 is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and fibrosis.
- Studies have suggested a role for TGFB2 in wound healing and tissue repair.
