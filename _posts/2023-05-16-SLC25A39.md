# Information about gene SLC25A39

## Genetic position, pathology and function
The SLC25A39 gene is located on chromosome 17 in humans. The gene encodes a protein belonging to the mitochondrial solute carrier family. The protein is involved in the transport of amino acids into the mitochondria, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. Mutation in the SLC25A39 gene has been associated with developmental disorders, such as autistic spectrum disorder and language delay.

## Function for gene
The SLC25A39 protein is a mitochondrial solute carrier that transports amino acids into the mitochondria, which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.
