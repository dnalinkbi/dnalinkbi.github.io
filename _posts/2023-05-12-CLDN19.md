## Gene: CLDN19

### Genetic Position
CLDN19 is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p32.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in CLDN19 have been associated with familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a rare condition characterized by defects in renal tubular magnesium and calcium reabsorption. 

### Function
CLDN19 is a member of the tight junction proteins that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. It acts as a paracellular channel for magnesium and calcium ions in the renal tubules.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in CLDN19.

### Related Disease
Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in CLDN19 and other genes that encode tight junction proteins. The condition is characterized by defects in renal tubular magnesium and calcium reabsorption, leading to severe hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for FHHNC. Treatment mainly consists of magnesium and potassium supplementation to manage hypomagnesemia, and dietary management to reduce calcium intake. In severe cases, renal transplantation may be required. The prognosis for FHHNC varies depending on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug therapy for FHHNC. However, some drugs such as thiazide diuretics and potassium-sparing diuretics have been used to manage hypercalciuria and kidney stones in patients with FHHNC.
