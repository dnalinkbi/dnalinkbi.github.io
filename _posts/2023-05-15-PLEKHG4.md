## Gene Information
**Gene Symbol:** PLEKHG4 <br>
**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1q21.2 <br>
**Aliases:** ARHGEF17, FLJ10531, FLJ22360, JPLEKHA, KIAA1145 <br>

## Function
PLEKHG4 encodes for a protein that belongs to the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) family. The protein is involved in molecular pathways such as axon guidance, cell migration, and dendritic spine morphogenesis. 

## External IDs and Sites

## Related Disease
PLEKHG4 has been associated with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Hyperthyroidism. However, further studies are necessary to fully understand the genetic contribution of PLEKHG4 to these diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments for PLEKHG4-related diseases as the role of the gene in these conditions is not yet fully understood.

## Drug Response
There is not enough information on the role of PLEKHG4 in drug response.
