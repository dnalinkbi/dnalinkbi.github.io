# Gene Information for PHOX2B

## Genetic Position

PHOX2B gene is located on Chromosome 4 (4p13) from base pair 27930117 to 27950024. 

## Pathology

Mutations in the PHOX2B gene are associated with Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system. It is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a polyalanine tract expansion mutation in exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. 

## Function

The PHOX2B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal development of the autonomic nervous system. This protein is involved in the differentiation and migration of neural crest cells which give rise to several tissues and structures including the autonomic nervous system.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

The most common mutation in PHOX2B associated with Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a heterozygous, polyalanine repeat expansion mutation in exon 3. This repeat expansion ranges from 24 to 33 alanine residues and is associated with variable penetrance and expressivity of the disease. 

Some of the AA mutations associated with PHOX2B gene are:

- G63R (rs28939681) 
- G81A (rs267606826) 
- A120S (rs192375077) 
- E143K (rs747636328) 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) and InDels (Insertions and Deletions) in PHOX2B gene which are reported in different cancers and tumors. Some of these SNVs and InDels with their dbSNP IDs are:

- rs35257896, G>C 
- rs765558801, G>A 
- rs878853345, G>A 
- rs789856926, G>A 

## Related Disease

Mutations in PHOX2B gene are associated with:

- Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) 
- Neuroblastoma (NB) 
- Ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB) 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) and treatment is aimed at managing symptoms which include respiratory failure and Hirschsprung disease (a type of bowel obstruction). 

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response for Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) associated with PHOX2B gene mutations.
