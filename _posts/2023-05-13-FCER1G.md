# Gene FCER1G

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1 (NC_000001.11) 162,352,900 - 162,472,783
- **Pathology:** FCER1G (Fc fragment of IgE receptor Ig) gene is associated with allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.
- **Function:** The FCER1G gene provides instructions to make a protein called the high-affinity IgE receptor gamma chain, which is a component of the receptor for Immunoglobulin E (IgE). This receptor is found on immune system cells called mast cells and basophils. The binding of IgE to this receptor leads to the activation of mast cells and basophils, releasing inflammatory chemicals, causing allergic reactions.

- Atopic dermatitis

## Treatment and Prognosis

Current treatments for allergic diseases associated with the FCER1G gene aimed at suppressing mast cell degranulation, which could control or alleviate allergic reactions. Drugs such as antihistamines, glucocorticoids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists are often used for treating allergic diseases. However, individual treatment and prognosis information require evaluation by a qualified healthcare provider.

## Drug Response

Studies have shown that some pharmacological inhibitors such as masitinib and ibrutinib targeting the FCER1G gene show efficacy in suppressing mast cell activation and could, therefore, be used to treat allergic diseases associated with the FCER1G gene.
