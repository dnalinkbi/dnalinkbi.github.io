## Information about gene SELL

- **Genetic position:** 1q24.2 
- **Function for gene:** SELL (Selectin L) encodes a glycoprotein that plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and recruitment to sites of inflammation. 
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 6402
    - Genomic location: NC_000001.11 (171,039,408..171,063,807)
    - Aliases: CD62L, LAM1, LNHR, LSEL
- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: 10850
    - NCBI Entrez: 6402
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000117525
    - OMIM: 153240
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P14151
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - No amino acid mutations reported in dbSNP
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No somatic SNVs/InDels reported in dbSNP
- **Related disease:** SELL mutations are associated with L-selectin Deficiency (LEND) and LAD Type I (LADI)
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Management is mainly symptomatic and supportive, and includes the use of immunoglobulin therapy and antibiotics for infections. Stem cell transplantation has been reported to provide long-term improvement in LAD I patients.
- **Drug response:** There is limited data on drug response in LEND and LADI patients
