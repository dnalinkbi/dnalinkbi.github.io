## Gene MECP2 information

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** MECP2 gene is located on the X chromosome at Xq28 position.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the MECP2 gene have been associated with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development in girls. The syndrome causes intellectual disability, seizures, and difficulty in coordination and movement.
- **Function:** MECP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called methyl CpG binding protein 2. This protein is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to methylated regions of DNA and recruiting other proteins to activate or repress gene expression.

### Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
- **Gene ID:** 4204
- **Genomic Location:** Xq28
- **Aliases:** RS, AUTSX3, MRXS13, PPMX, RTT
- **External IDs:**
   - HGNC: 7003
   - NCBI Entrez: 4204
   - Ensembl: ENSG00000169057
   - OMIM: 300005
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51608

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Most mutations in the MECP2 gene are missense mutations, resulting in a change in a single amino acid in the protein. Some mutations are nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations, resulting in a truncated protein.
- **AA Mutation List:** Some of the common missense mutations in the MECP2 gene are:
   - R106W (dbSNP ID: rs121909230)
   - R133C (dbSNP ID: rs61750900)
   - T158M (dbSNP ID: rs61751002)
   - R168X (dbSNP ID: rs121909232)
   - R255X (dbSNP ID: rs121909235)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations in the MECP2 gene are rare, and their role in cancer development is not well understood yet.
- However, some somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the COSMIC database:
   - c.695_696delCT (dbSNP ID: COSM65976)
   - c.473C>T (dbSNP ID: COSM35125)

### Related Disease
- Rett syndrome is the primary disease associated with mutations in the MECP2 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for Rett syndrome yet, and treatment is focused on symptom management.
- Early intervention, physiotherapy, and communication therapy can help improve the quality of life of patients with Rett syndrome.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset. However, with appropriate treatment and care, many people with Rett syndrome can live into adulthood.

### Drug Response
- There is no specific drug that can treat Rett syndrome, but some drugs can help manage specific symptoms. For example, anticonvulsants can control seizures, and benzodiazepines can improve breathing difficulties.
- Some drugs that are being investigated for their potential to treat Rett syndrome are:
   - IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1)
   - Trofinetide
