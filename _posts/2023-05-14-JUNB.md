## Gene Information

**Gene:** JUNB

**Location:** Chromosome 19q13.32

**Aliases:** AP-1, Jun-B, Transcription factor jun-B

## Function

JUNB is a transcription factor that belongs to the AP-1 family. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune response, and differentiation. JUNB forms a heterodimeric complex with other members of the AP-1 family, such as c-Jun and Fos proteins. This complex binds to the promoters of target genes and regulates their transcription.
