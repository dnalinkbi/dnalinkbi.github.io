# Gene Name: PURA

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 5
- Start Position: 130,013,560 bp
- End Position: 130,051,229 bp

## Pathology
PURA gene mutations have been associated with a range of neurological disorders such as PURA syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, and feeding difficulties. 

## Function
The PURA gene encodes the protein Pur-alpha, which is involved in the regulation of transcription, DNA replication, and RNA processing.

- OMIM: 176270
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P14873
- Aliases: PUR1, PURalpha

## Mutation Information
- AA Mutation List: A list of AA mutations in PURA gene can be found in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Some examples include R186*, R277Q, L255R, and V302M.
- Mutation Type: Nonsense, Missense, Frameshift
- dbSNP ID: rs587776777 (R277Q)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the PURA gene.

## Related Diseases
- PURA syndrome
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Intellectual disability
- Epilepsy
- Feeding difficulties

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for PURA syndrome, and management involves treating the symptoms such as seizures and feeding difficulties. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for PURA syndrome. However, some drugs used to treat seizures, such as valproic acid and levetiracetam, may be effective in managing PURA syndrome symptoms in some patients.
