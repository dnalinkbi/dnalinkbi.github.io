# Information about Gene SH3GL1

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- **Genetic Position:** The SH3GL1 gene is located on chromosome  SH3GL1 (endosomal protein involved in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling). The genomic coordinate of the gene is 16p13.3. 
- **Pathology:** SH3GL1 has been implicated in various disorders such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury.


## Function for Gene

- The SH3GL1 gene encodes an endocytic protein that is involved in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. 
- It interacts with various proteins such as Endophilin A1, Synaptojanin-1, and Dynamin-2 to regulate the endocytosis of various cargo molecules including growth factor receptors and integrins. 
- It has also been shown to play a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.
