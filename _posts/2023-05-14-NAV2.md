## Information about Gene NAV2

### Genetic Position

NAV2 gene (Neuron Navigator 2) is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q24.2).

### Pathology

Mutations in the NAV2 gene have been associated with various pathologies including Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

### Function

The NAV2 gene encodes a protein called Neuron Navigator 2, which is involved in neuronal development and maintenance. It plays a crucial role in neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and neuronal migration.
