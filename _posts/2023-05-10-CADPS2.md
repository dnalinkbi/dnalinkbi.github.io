# Information about Gene CADPS2

## Genetic Position
- The gene CADPS2 is located on chromosome 7 at the position 7q31.1. 

## Pathology and Function
- The CADPS2 gene encodes for the calcium dependent secretion activator 2, which is a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. 
- Studies have shown that mutations or variations in the CADPS2 gene may be associated with various neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders.
