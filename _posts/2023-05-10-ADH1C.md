# Information about Gene ADH1C

## Genetic Position
The gene ADH1C is located on chromosome 4q23 and spans approximately 15 kilobase pairs.

## Pathology
This gene has been associated with alcohol dependence and addiction. Specifically, certain genetic variants within ADH1C have been shown to alter alcohol metabolism, leading to an increased risk for alcoholism and other related disorders.

## Function
ADH1C encodes alcohol dehydrogenase, which plays a key role in the breakdown and metabolism of ethanol in the liver. The protein encoded by this gene is responsible for the metabolism of up to 70% of ethanol in humans.

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for alcohol dependence often involves psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and support group participation, as well as medications, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disorder and adherence to treatment.

## Drug Response
Certain genetic variants within ADH1C have been shown to influence response to medications used in the treatment of alcohol dependence, such as naltrexone.
