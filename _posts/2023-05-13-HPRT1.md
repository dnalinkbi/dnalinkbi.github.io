# Information about gene HPRT1

## Overview

**Gene name:** HPRT1 (Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1)

**Genetic position:** Chromosome X: 134,871,938-134,913,621

**Aliases:** HPRT, HPRT-1, HGPRT

## Function

HPRT1 encodes hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, an enzyme that plays a key role in the purine salvage pathway. This pathway recycles purine bases and nucleosides, conserving them for use in DNA and RNA synthesis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Some of the somatic SNVs and InDels reported in HPRT1 gene with dbSNP IDs are:

| Variant | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.446-79T>G | SNV | rs758789061 |
| c.-124_-122delAAG | InDel | rs113994209 |

## Related disease

Mutations in the HPRT1 gene can cause Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare X-linked recessive disorder that affects the nervous system and causes hyperuricemia. Symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome include self-injurious behavior, gouty arthritis, intellectual disability, and dystonia.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no cure for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and treatment is mostly supportive. Medications to control hyperuricemia and behavioral therapy may help with symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is generally poor, and life expectancy is reduced.

## Drug response

Several drugs have been shown to improve symptoms in individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Allopurinol helps to reduce uric acid levels, which can alleviate joint pain. Dopamine agonists may help to improve symptoms of dystonia and abnormal movements.
