## Information on gene SDHA

### Genetic Position
SDHA is located at the genomic position 5p15.33.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SDHA gene are associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II deficiency and hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome (PGL/PCC).

### Function for gene
The SDHA gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the Krebs cycle, which is responsible for the generation of cellular energy in the form of ATP.

- Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome (PGL/PCC)

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for mitochondrial complex II deficiency or PGL/PCC, but treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

### Drug response
There is limited information on the drug response of SDHA mutations. However, recent studies have shown that inhibitors of the mTOR pathway may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of SDH-deficient tumors.
