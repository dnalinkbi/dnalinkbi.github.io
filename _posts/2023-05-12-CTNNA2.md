## Gene CTNNA2 Information

### Gene Information:
- **Function for gene:** CTNNA2 gene encodes for alpha-catenin-2 protein, which is a cell adhesion molecule involved in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location:** Gene ID: 1495, Genomic location: Chromosome 2q31.1-q31.2
- **Aliases:** CTNNA2, Alpha-N-catenin, CTNNA, Alpha-T-catenin, Alpha-E-catenin

### Related Disease:
- **Disease:** Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
- **Description:** CTNNA2 mutations have been identified in families with HDGC syndrome, which is characterized by an increased risk for diffuse gastric cancer. 

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- There is no specific treatment for HDGC syndrome. However, early detection and screening can improve prognosis.

### Drug Response:
- Currently, there is no known drug response related to CTNNA2 mutations.
