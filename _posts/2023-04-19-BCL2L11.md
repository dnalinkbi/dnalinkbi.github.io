### Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** BCL2L11
- **Aliases:** BIM, BAM, L(NC)BIM, BCL2L11S, BIM-gamma
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 2 at 2q13-q14
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 977
    - NCBI Entrez: 10018
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000136068
    - OMIM: 603602

### Function
BCL2L11 gene encodes for protein Bim, which is a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a crucial role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. It promotes cell death by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1, and preventing their inhibitory interaction with other pro-apoptotic factors.

### Mutations

There are several somatic mutations reported in the BCL2L11 gene in different cancer types. Some important ones are:
- SNVs: p.R91W, p.K19N, and p.L135Q in lung cancer; p.G102E and p.V133E in ovarian carcinoma; p.S70P in colorectal cancer; and p.L110I in melanoma.
- InDels: c.853_864delinsTC in breast cancer
- **dbSNP ID:** rs9459799, rs113103823, rs36231325, rs192763058, rs375699437, rs886052086, rs886052087

### Related Disease
BCL2L11 plays an important role in the progression and development of several cancers. Many studies have reported alterations in the BCL2L11 gene and protein expression in different cancers such as:
- Breast cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Lung cancer
- Ovarian carcinoma
- Melanoma
- Hematological malignancies 

### Treatment and Prognosis
BCL2L11 gene is considered as an important therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Several BCL-2 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, including ABT-199, ABT-263, and ABT-737, that show promising results in the treatment of different cancers. 

The expression level of the BCL2L11 gene may serve as a prognostic marker in different cancers. Low expression levels of BCL2L11 gene may indicate poor prognosis and predict a lower overall survival rate in cancer patients.

### Drug Response 
ABT-263, a BCL-2 inhibitor, showed a significant response in BCL2L11-dependent cancer cell lines, leading to apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Additionally, drugs that target BCL2L11 may sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy and provide a synergistic effect.
