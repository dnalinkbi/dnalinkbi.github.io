# Gene Information: OR2J1

## Genetic Position
- OR2J1 is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.33.

## Pathology and Function
- OR2J1 is a member of the olfactory receptor (OR) gene family, which is responsible for recognizing and responding to odors.
- OR2J1 is specifically involved in the detection of floral scent compounds, such as β-ionone and other volatile organic compounds. 
- Alterations in the OR2J1 gene have not been linked directly to any pathology, but genetic variants in OR genes have been reported to be associated with various health conditions.
- OR2J1 has been found to play a role in enhancing circadian rhythm and modulating insulin secretion in mice.
