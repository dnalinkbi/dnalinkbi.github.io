# Information about gene SOX10

## Genetic Position
- The SOX10 gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1.

## Pathology
- Mutations in the SOX10 gene are associated with various types of developmental disorders, such as Waardenburg syndrome (WS), neural crest disorder with predominant sensory involvement (NCS), and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR).
- WS is characterized by deafness, pigmentary abnormalities, and hypoplastic blue irides. Mutations in SOX10 have been identified as responsible for WS type 4.
- NCS is characterized by skin, hearing, and digestive system abnormalities. Mutations in SOX10 are associated with NCS type 2.
- HSCR is a congenital disorder that affects the colon and causes chronic constipation. Mutations in SOX10 have been identified in patients with HSCR.

## Function
- The SOX10 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages, including melanocytes, peripheral and enteric neurons, and glial cells. 
- SOX10 regulates the expression of various target genes that are involved in melanocyte proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as well as in the development of the enteric nervous system.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- A missense mutation p.R42P in SOX10 has been associated with Waardenburg syndrome type 4C. This mutation is represented by dbSNP ID: rs1057518871.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for SOX10 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
- Waardenburg syndrome, type 4C (OMIM 613266)
- Neural crest disorder with predominant sensory involvement, type 2 (OMIM 616920)
- Hirschsprung disease, type 2 (OMIM 600155)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for genetic developmental disorders caused by SOX10 mutations. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive, focusing on managing the specific symptoms associated with the disorder.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the disorder and the degree of organ involvement. The long-term outlook for patients with SOX10-related disorders varies widely depending on the specific genetic mutation and the individual patient.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no targeted drug therapy for SOX10-related disorders.
