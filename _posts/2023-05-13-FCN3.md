# Information about Gene FCN3

## Gene Position and Aliases

- Gene: FCN3 (ficolin 3)
- Chromosome: 1
- Start Position: 215,640,933 bp
- End Position: 215,655,151 bp
- Strand: Plus

Aliases:
- HAKA (Human Acute Phase Serum Amyloid A depletion-associated factor)
- HsFCN3
- ficolin-3

## Function for Gene

The FCN3 gene encodes ficolin-3, which plays a role in the activation of the complement system via the lectin pathway and is involved in innate immunity.
