# Gene PHF2

## Basic Information
- The PHF2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 9 at position 22.2.
- PHF2 encodes a protein called PHF2 (PHD-finger protein 2) which contains a Jumonji C domain and a PHD finger. 
- The function of this gene is to regulate gene expression via histone demethylation and transcriptional regulation.
