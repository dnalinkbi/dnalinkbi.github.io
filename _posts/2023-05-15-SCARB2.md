# Information about Gene SCARB2

## Genetic Position
- SCARB2 gene is located on the 4q12 chromosome.
   
## Pathology
- SCARB2 has been associated with the development of various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Gaucher disease and cerebral malaria.

## Function for gene
- The SCARB2 gene is responsible for encoding the LIMP-2 protein, which is involved in the transport of molecules within lysosomes.

## External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: 10602, NCBI Entrez: 950, Ensembl: ENSG00000138668, OMIM: 602780, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P31946.
- Aliases: CD36L2, LGP85, LIMPII, SCARB2, and CD36b-like 2.

- c.362T > G, p.Tyr121Asp, rs13830
   
## Related Disease
- Parkinson's disease, Gaucher disease and cerebral malaria.
   
## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for diseases caused by SCARB2 gene mutations are largely dependent on the specific disease and symptoms.
- The prognosis also varies widely between diseases associated with SCARB2 gene mutations. 
   
## Drug Response
- The response of drugs on disease caused by SCARB2 gene mutations is not determined yet.
