# Information about Gene TTC19

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function
- Gene: TTC19
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17q11.2
- Pathology: mutations in the TTC19 gene are associated with Leigh syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the central nervous system
- Function: The TTC19 gene encodes a protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, which is essential for the production of ATP.
