# Information on Gene DIRAS3 

## Gene position, pathology, and function

**Gene Position:** DIRAS3 gene is located on chromosome 1, specifically on the long arm of the chromosome at position 31.1 (1q31.1).

**Pathology:** Studies have linked DIRAS3 to various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. Methylation of DIRAS3's promoter region has also been linked with early-onset of liver cancer.

**Function:** DIRAS3 gene encodes for a small GTPase protein called Di-Ras3, which is involved in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and adhesion. Additionally, DIRAS3 has been found to have a role in the regulation of insulin signaling.
