# Information about Gene CTNNA3

## Description
CTNNA3 (Catenin Alpha 3) also known as "alphaT-catenin" is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 10q21 with a genomic size of 1.6 kb. The gene is composed of 22 exons, and the encoded protein has a molecular weight of 104.5 kDa.

## Function
CTNNA3 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the catenin family, which is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, signal transduction, and actin cytoskeleton organization. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the epithelial cell layers as well as polarization of cells in developing embryos.
