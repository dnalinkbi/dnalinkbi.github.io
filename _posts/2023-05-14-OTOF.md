# Information on Gene OTOF

## Genetic Position
OTOF is located on chromosome 2, specifically at 2p23.1.

## Pathology
The OTOF gene is associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment. Mutations in this gene cause deafness which can either be prelingual or postlingual.

## Function
The OTOF gene codes for a protein named otoferlin which is involved in regulating calcium-mediated exocytosis in sensory cells of the inner ear. It plays a crucial role in transmitting sounds from the outer ear to the brain.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 9365
- Genomic location: NC_000002.12 (121706412..122298616, complement)
- HGNC: 17181
- NCBI Entrez: 9365 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000185028 
- OMIM: 603681 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60890

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The following are some of the reported AA mutations in OTOF:
- c.4606G>A (p.Arg1536His) rs267607168
- c.4291C>T (p.Arg1431*) rs80338963
- c.1961C>T (p.Arg654*) rs775167385

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in OTOF.

## Related Diseases
- Deafness, autosomal recessive 9 (DFNB9)
- Auditory neuropathy, autosomal recessive (ARNSHA)

## Treatment and Prognosis
At present, there is no cure for the genetic form of deafness associated with OTOF mutations. Treatment options include hearing aids and cochlear implants which are helpful in most cases.

## Drug Response
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs targeting OTOF-related deafness.
