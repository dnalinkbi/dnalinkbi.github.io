# Information about Gene DCTD

## Genetic Position

The DCTD gene is located on chromosome 4q32.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in the DCTD gene have been linked to a variety of different cancers.

## Function

The DCTD gene encodes an enzyme known as deoxycytidine deaminase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA.
