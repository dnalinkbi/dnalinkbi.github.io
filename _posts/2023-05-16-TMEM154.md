## Gene: TMEM154

The TMEM154 gene is located on chromosome 5 and is associated with susceptibility to infection by lentiviruses. The function of this gene is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in immune response and regulation of host-virus interactions.

### Function for gene

The TMEM154 gene is involved in the immune response to lentiviral infections. Studies suggest that variations in this gene may influence the susceptibility to and progression of lentivirus infections in sheep and cattle.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several known amino acid mutations associated with TMEM154. Some of these include:

- L319F (rs465893892)
- L325F (rs464799198)
- L308I (rs460716567)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Not applicable as TMEM154 mutations are associated with inherited susceptibility to lentivirus infections rather than somatic mutations.

### Related disease

Variations in the TMEM154 gene have been associated with susceptibility to lentivirus infections in sheep and cattle. These infections can cause chronic diseases such as maedi-visna in sheep and enzootic bovine leukosis in cattle.

### Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no known cure for maedi-visna and enzootic bovine leukosis. Management of infected animals involves control of spread through testing and culling, as well as supportive care for clinical signs.

### Drug response

There is no known drug that directly targets the TMEM154 gene. Management of lentivirus infections typically involves supportive care and prevention of transmission.
