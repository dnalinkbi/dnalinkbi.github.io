## KCNA2 gene

- Function: KCNA2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 2) encodes a protein that forms a voltage-gated potassium channel in the membrane of excitable cells. The KCNA2 channel is involved in regulating the resting membrane potential and action potential repolarization in neurons.

- External IDs: KCNA2 gene is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p13.3 and has the following external IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 3738
    - HGNC: 6289
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000134675
    - NCBI Entrez: 3738 
    - OMIM: 176262
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16389

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.296T>C (p.Leu99Pro) rs199473077
    - c.316C>T (p.Thr106Ile) rs199787034
    - c.398G>A (p.Arg133Gln) rs374006072
    - c.621G>C (p.Ala207Pro) rs137853908
    
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - c.791C>T (p.Pro264Leu) rs747254375
    - c.914A>G (p.Arg305Gly) rs1057518947
    - c.956G>A (p.Val319Ile) rs1057518981
    
- Related diseases: Mutations in KCNA2 gene are associated with the following diseases:
    - Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 17
    - Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS)
    - Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia 1 (PKD1)

- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment of KCNA2-associated diseases is mostly symptomatic and supportive. There are no specific drugs or therapies available for the treatment of these diseases. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

- Drug response: There is limited information about the drug response in KCNA2-associated diseases. However, studies have shown that some anti-epileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine and phenytoin, can be effective in reducing seizures in patients with KCNA2 mutations.
