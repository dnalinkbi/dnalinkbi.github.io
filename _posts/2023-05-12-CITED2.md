## Function
CITED2 (CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2) is a transcription co-activator that regulates the expression of several genes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. It interacts with many transcription factors, including HIF-1Î±, CREB, and Smad proteins, to modulate their functions. CITED2 also plays a significant role in cardiac development and angiogenesis.

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list:** There are several missense mutations reported for CITED2 on the dbSNP database. Some of these include:
    - L170I, R213W, R271Q, G279V, V317I, M326I, and R348H
- **Mutation type:** Missense mutations
- **dbSNP ID:** rs114609443, rs137853247, rs74315301, rs199779372, rs111356379, rs200413094, rs200905773

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the COSMIC database.
