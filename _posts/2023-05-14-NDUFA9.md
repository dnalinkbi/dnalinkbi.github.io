## Gene NDUFA9

- Function: NDUFA9 is a subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I that is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain.

- External IDs: 
  - Gene ID: 4695
  - Genomic Location: Chromosome 8; 74,652,270-74,659,594
  - Aliases: CI-49, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 49 kDa subunit, NDUFV2

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
  - c.241C>T (p.Arg81Cys); rs121912991
  - c.445G>A (p.Gly149Asp); rs749505248

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - No somatic mutations reported in dbSNP

- Related disease: Defects in NDUFA9 are associated with Leigh syndrome (LS), which is a severe neurological disorder that typically arises in infancy or childhood. LS is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the central nervous system with motor and intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental regression. 

- Treatment and prognosis: There is currently no cure for Leigh syndrome, and treatment primarily involves supportive care and symptom management. The prognosis is generally poor, with most patients experiencing progressive neurological decline and early mortality. 

- Drug response: There is currently no known drug that specifically targets NDUFA9.
