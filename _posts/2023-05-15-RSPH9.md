# Information about gene RSPH9

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- **Genetic position**: RSPH9 gene is located on chromosome 6 at position q25.1.
- **Pathology**: Genetic variations in the RSPH9 gene have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, and infertility due to impaired ciliary motility.
- **Function**: The RSPH9 gene encodes for radial spoke head protein 9, which plays a key role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, and contributes to the proper movement of these organelles.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are several reported missense mutations in the RSPH9 gene associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Some notable ones are: 
  - p.Arg429Gln (rs863223675)
  - p.Leu220Arg (rs201771935)
  - p.Pro37Ser (rs374492383)
- These mutations are all missense mutations, which means that they change a single amino acid in the RSPH9 protein sequence.
- dbSNP ID is included in parentheses after the AA mutation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the RSPH9 gene.

## Related disease
- Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment options for primary ciliary dyskinesia are limited and mainly focused on managing the symptoms of the disease, such as chronic respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, and fertility issues.
- Prognosis for PCD varies widely depending on the severity of the disease, and can range from relatively mild symptoms to severe respiratory failure.

## Drug response
- There is currently no specific drug available to treat primary ciliary dyskinesia, although some medications such as antibiotics and bronchodilators may be prescribed to manage symptoms.
