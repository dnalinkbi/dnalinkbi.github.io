# Information About Gene B4GALT2

## Genetic Position
- B4GALT2 gene is located on chromosome 1 at position 1q42.3.

## Pathology
- Mutations in B4GALT2 can lead to congenital disorder of glycosylation type 2a (CDG2a), also known as lactosylceramide synthase deficiency.
- CDG2a is a rare disorder characterized by developmental delay, failure to thrive, seizures, and liver disease.

## Function
- B4GALT2 encodes beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, an enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of complex N-linked and O-linked glycans.
- Glycans are important components of cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses.

## External IDs
- Gene ID: 8708
- Genomic Location: 1q42.3
- Aliases: β4Gal-T2, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly218Ala (rs137853982)
- p.Thr256Pro (rs137853981)
- p.Arg270His (rs137853979)
- p.Leu292Pro (rs137853978)
- p.His316Arg (rs120074156)
- Mutation Type: Missense

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels reported

## Related Disease
- Congenital disorder of glycosylation type 2a (CDG2a)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis for CDG2a varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.
- There is currently no cure for CDG2a, but treatment may include physical therapy, medication, and special diets.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no targeted drug therapy available for CDG2a.
