## Gene: ARF4

### Genetic Position

The ARF4 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p24.2).

### Pathology and Function

The ARF4 gene encodes for the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family, which is involved in regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking, protein secretion, and cell signaling. The primary function of ARF4 is to regulate the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations reported for the ARF4 gene in the dbSNP database.

- p.Gly82Arg (rs140439926)
- p.Val157Ile (rs147490618)

Both mutations are missense mutations, where a single nucleotide change results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the ARF4 gene in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease
