# Information about Gene FHL1

## Genetic Position
The gene FHL1 is located on chromosome Xp26.3 and spans over 446 kilobases.

## Pathology and Function
FHL1 gene encodes four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 1, which is mainly expressed in striated muscles. Mutations in this gene have been found to be associated with multiple diseases, including several types of myopathy, X-linked scapuloperoneal syndrome, and reducing body myopathy. The function of FHL1 appears to involve interactions with cytoskeletal elements and transcriptional regulation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
One of the mutations in FHL1 that has been associated with myopathy is p.Glu400Lys. This is a missense mutation in exon 7, which changes a glutamic acid to a lysine at amino acid position 400. The dbSNP ID for this mutation is rs879255798.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in FHL1.

## Related Disease
Mutations in FHL1 have been linked to multiple diseases, including:
- X-linked dominant scapuloperoneal myopathy
- Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
- Reducing body myopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific disease associated with a mutation in FHL1. There is currently no known cure for any of the diseases associated with FHL1 mutations, though treatments may include physical therapy, medication, and surgery.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets FHL1, though medications used to treat symptoms of the associated diseases may be used.
