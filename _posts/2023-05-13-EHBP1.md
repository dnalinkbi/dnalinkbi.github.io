# Gene EHBP1

## Genetic Position
EHBP1 gene is located at chromosome 2, specifically at the q21.3 position.

## Pathology
EHBP1 mutations have been associated with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of cholesterol in the blood which could lead to heart disease.

## Function
EHBP1 encodes a protein involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking. Its exact function in the context of FH is still not clear.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 24954
- NCBI Entrez: 57524
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171022
- OMIM: 607926
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q7Z6J1

Aliases: EHB21, EPI64BP, KIAA1578

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations associated with FH in EHBP1 gene:
- p.Arg408Trp (rs200126568)
- p.Tyr817Cys (rs141385214)
- p.Ile970Val (rs142953591)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in EHBP1 gene as it is not frequently involved in tumorigenesis.

## Related Diseases
EHBP1 mutations have been associated with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of cholesterol in the blood which could lead to heart disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Several therapies to reduce the levels of cholesterol in the blood are available for individuals with FH, including lifestyle changes, cholesterol-lowering medications, and in severe cases, surgery such as apheresis.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available regarding drug response in individuals with EHBP1 mutations.
