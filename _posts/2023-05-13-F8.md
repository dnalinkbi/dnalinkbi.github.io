### Gene: F8

---

#### Function
The F8 gene encodes the coagulation factor VIII, which is essential for blood clotting. The protein acts as a cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa, accelerating the conversion of factor X to factor Xa.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the F8 gene.

#### Related Disease
Mutations in the F8 gene can cause hemophilia A, which is a bleeding disorder that occurs due to deficiency or dysfunction of factor VIII.

#### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of hemophilia A typically involves replacement therapy with clotting factor concentrates. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

#### Drug Response
Several drugs are available for the treatment of hemophilia A. They include factor VIII replacement therapies such as Advate, Eloctate, and Kogenate FS, as well as gene therapy.
