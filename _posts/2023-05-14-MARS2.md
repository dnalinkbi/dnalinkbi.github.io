## Information about Gene MARS2

### Genetic Position

The MARS2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33.2) at the genomic coordinates 206,511,385-206,563,792.

### Pathology and Function for Gene

The MARS2 gene encodes a mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase which is involved in protein translation. Variants in the MARS2 gene have been associated with various neuropathy and encephalopathy syndromes.
