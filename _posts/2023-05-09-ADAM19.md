## Gene: ADAM19

### Genetic Position
- ADAM19 is located on chromosome 5q31.1.

### Pathology
- ADAM19 is associated with various pathologies, including cancer, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases.

### Function
- ADAM19 encodes a metalloproteinase enzyme that plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and proteolysis. It is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound proteins, including cytokines and growth factors, which regulate various cellular processes.

### External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs for ADAM19 gene are HGNC: 30138, NCBI Entrez: 8754, Ensembl: ENSG00000164042, OMIM: 603121, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UK45.
- Aliases for ADAM19 gene are:

| Symbols | Names |
| --- | --- |
| ADAM19 | ADAM metallopeptidase domain 19 |
| KIAA0749 | KIAA0749 |
| MADDAM | MADDAM |
| meltrin beta | Meltrin beta |

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

| 5:g.138177121A>G | SNV | rs117705640 |

### Related Disease
- ADAM19 is associated with various diseases, including:

    - Cancer: ADAM19 plays a role in tumor invasion and metastasis, and it is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer.
    - Asthma: ADAM19 is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, and its expression is upregulated in the airway epithelium of asthmatic patients.
    - Cardiovascular Diseases: ADAM19 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, and it is associated with various cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and hypertension.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment available for ADAM19-related diseases. However, several drugs targeting ADAM19 are currently under development as potential therapies for cancer and other diseases.
- The prognosis for ADAM19-related diseases depends on various factors, such as disease stage, patient age, and comorbidities.

### Drug Response
- Several drugs targeting ADAM19 are currently under development as potential therapies for cancer and other diseases, including:
