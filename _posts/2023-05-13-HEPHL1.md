## Information about gene HEPHL1

### Genetic Position
The HEPHL1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q35.

### Pathology
Mutations in the HEPHL1 gene have been associated with a number of disorders including hemochromatosis type 4B (also known as HFE4B) and hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. Both disorders involve the accumulation of iron in various tissues and organs, which can lead to a range of symptoms including fatigue, joint pain, cirrhosis, and heart failure.

### Function
The HEPHL1 gene encodes a protein called hephaestin-like 1, which is involved in regulating the absorption and storage of iron in the body. Specifically, hephaestin-like 1 is thought to play a role in transporting iron from the intestine into the bloodstream, as well as in releasing iron from storage sites like the liver and spleen.

### Related Diseases
- Hemochromatosis type 4B (HFE4B)
- Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for HFE4B and hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome typically involves managing iron levels through a combination of phlebotomy (blood removal), iron chelation therapy (medication to remove excess iron), and/or dietary changes. The prognosis for individuals with these disorders can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response related to HEPHL1 mutations.
