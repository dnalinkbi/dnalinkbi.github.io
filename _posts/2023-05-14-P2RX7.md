## Gene: P2RX7

#### Function:
P2RX7 gene codes for a purinergic ligand-gated ion channel, P2X purinoceptor 7, that is involved in various cellular processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and cytokine release.

#### Related Diseases:
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
Studies have shown that P2RX7 gene activation can be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as RA and AD, respectively. 
Regarding the prognosis, a study reported that patients with CLL with high expression of P2RX7 are associated with favorable clinical outcomes (PMID: 29352278).

#### Drug Response:
- Brilliant Blue G (BBG): A P2RX7 antagonist, has been shown to inhibit the inflammasome and decrease inflammatory response (PMID: 30194623).
- A-438079: A P2RX7 antagonist, found to have neuroprotective effects in animal studies (PMID: 23761836).
