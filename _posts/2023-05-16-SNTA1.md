## Gene: SNTA1
- **Function:** SNTA1 (also known as Î±-syntrophin) is a scaffold protein that interacts with dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which are important for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. It also plays a role in signal transduction pathways by binding to signaling proteins such as ion channels, receptors, and kinases.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for SNTA1.

- **Related Disease:** SNTA1 mutations have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC). DCM is a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and LVNC refers to the thickening of the myocardium in the left ventricle.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
There are no specific treatments for SNTA1-related cardiomyopathies. However, standard therapies for heart failure and arrhythmias can be used. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment.

- **Drug Response:**
There is currently no information on drug response specific to SNTA1-related cardiomyopathies.
