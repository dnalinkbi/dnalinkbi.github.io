## Gene: C1GALT1

### Genetic Position
C1GALT1 gene is located on chromosome 7 (7q21.3) from base pair 86,706,330 to base pair 86,756,002.

### Pathology
Abnormalities in C1GALT1 gene have been found to be associated with various types of cancer and immune disorders.

### Function
C1GALT1 encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the addition of core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase to O-glycosylated proteins, leading to the formation of core 1 O-glycan structures. These structures play important roles in cell adhesion, signaling, and immune response.

### Related Disease
Aberrant expression or mutations in C1GALT1 gene have been found to be associated with several types of cancer, such as colorectal, liver, pancreatic, and bladder cancer. Additionally, deficiency in C1GALT1 may lead to immune disorders, including Tn syndrome and Helicobacter pylori-related gastric diseases.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of C1GALT1-related diseases depend on the specific disease and its stage. There are no specific treatments targeting C1GALT1 itself, but some cancer therapies that target the abnormal glycosylation of proteins may indirectly affect C1GALT1 activity.

### Drug Response
There is currently no drug targeting C1GALT1, but some treatments targeting aberrant glycosylation of proteins have been approved or are under development, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors.
