# Gene: NR4A1

NR4A1 is a nuclear receptor protein-coding gene that is located on chromosome 12q13.13. It is also known as NUR77, TR3, NGFI-B, or HMR. 

## Function:

NR4A1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of various biological processes such as apoptosis, inflammation, metabolism, and immune response. It acts as a transcription factor that is activated by various stimuli, including stress, growth factors, and cytokines. NR4A1 plays a key role in the development and function of both immune and non-immune cells.
