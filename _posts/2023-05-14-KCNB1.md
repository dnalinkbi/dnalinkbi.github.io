## Gene KCNB1
- **Genetic position**: KCNB1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 20, specifically at the position 20q13.2.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in this gene have been associated with various neurological disorders such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders.
- **Function**: The KCNB1 gene encodes for the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1. This channel is involved in regulating the resting membrane potential and action potential repolarization.
- **External IDs**: The KCNB1 gene is also known as "potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily B member 1". Some of its aliases include "Kv2.1" and "HBK beta subunit".

    - c.846C>T (rs148275322)
    - c.822C>A (rs148275323)
- **Related disease**: Mutations in KCNB1 have been associated with various neurological disorders including:
    - Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 26 (EIEE26)
    - Intellectual developmental disorder with language impairment and autistic features (IDDLIAF)
    - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is no cure for genetic disorders caused by KCNB1 mutations. Treatment is symptom-based and may include medication to control seizures in the case of EIEE26.
- **Drug response**: Some studies have shown that mutations in KCNB1 may affect the responsiveness of certain antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine.
