## Gene CD81

**Function for gene:** The gene CD81 encodes for a protein called TAPA-1 (Target of the antiproliferative antibody 1), which plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. CD81 also acts as a receptor for various viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- No variants are currently reported in CD81 in the dbSNP database.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- No somatic variants are currently reported in CD81 in the dbSNP database.

**Related disease:** Mutations in CD81 have not been found to cause any particular disease. However, CD81 has been implicated in several diseases, including HCV infection, HIV infection, and cancer.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is no specific treatment or prognosis associated with CD81 mutations as none have been reported yet. However, several drugs that target CD81, including monoclonal antibodies, have been developed for the treatment of HCV and may have potential in the treatment of other related diseases.

**Drug response:** CD81 is a promising therapeutic target for HCV treatment, and several CD81-targeting drugs have been developed, including antibodies and peptides.
