# Information on Gene PMS1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- The PMS1 gene is located on chromosome 2, at position 2q31.1.
- It codes for a protein called postmeiotic segregation increased 1 (PMS1).
- PMS1 is a member of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, which corrects errors that occur during DNA replication.
- Mutations in the PMS1 gene have been associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of developing colorectal, endometrial, and other types of cancer.


## Function for Gene
- PMS1 is involved in the recognition and correction of DNA mismatches.
- It forms a heterodimer with MLH1, and together they form a complex that binds to mismatched DNA.
- This complex recruits other proteins to excise the mismatch and repair the DNA.

## Related Disease
- Lynch syndrome


## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for Lynch syndrome typically involves increased surveillance and screening to detect and remove cancerous cells as early as possible.
- The prognosis can vary depending on the specific cancer and the stage at which it is detected.


## Drug Response
- There is not currently a specific drug that targets PMS1 mutations. However, some treatments for Lynch syndrome involve chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
