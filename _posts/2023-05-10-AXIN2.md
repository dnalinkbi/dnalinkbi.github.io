# Gene Information for AXIN2

## Gene function

AXIN2 is a member of the Axin family which regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. This gene encodes a protein that contributes to the degradation of beta-catenin and regulation of the cellular proliferation. AXIN2 is involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.
