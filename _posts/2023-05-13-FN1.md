## Gene FN1 Information

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

The FN1 gene is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q34 and is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer development, tissue fibrosis, and cardiovascular diseases. The gene encodes for the fibronectin protein that is involved in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation processes. Fibronectin also plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, wound healing, and tissue repair.

### Gene Function

The FN1 gene encodes for the fibronectin protein, which acts as a mediator between cells and the ECM. Fibronectin binds to integrins on the cell surface and mediates cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Additionally, it also regulates signaling pathways that are important for cell growth, survival, and proliferation.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location

The FN1 gene is identified by the following external IDs:

- HGNC: 3734
- NCBI Entrez: 2335
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115414
- OMIM: 135600
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P02751

The gene's aliases include CIG, ED-B, FINC, FN, GFND, and GFND2.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There have been several AA mutations identified in the FN1 gene, including:

- p.Val98Leu (rs11577681)
- p.Val284Ile (rs374320826)
- p.Arg364Cys (rs1057519509)
- p.Leu662Pro (rs41316743)
- p.Arg1274Trp (rs200915228)

These mutations result from single nucleotide substitutions and lead to various pathological outcomes.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs and InDels identified in the FN1 gene that are associated with different types of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Some of the commonly mutated positions include:

- c.628C>T (rs183592270)
- c.2503T>C (rs17266504)
- c.2917C>T (rs192453527)
- c.3340G>A (rs200449993)

### Related Diseases

Several diseases are associated with mutations in the FN1 gene, including:

- Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits
- Fibronectin glomerulopathy
- Alzheimer's disease
- Atherosclerosis
- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Lung cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for diseases associated with the FN1 gene mutations depends on the disease's severity and stage. For example, breast and lung cancers may be treated using chemotherapy, surgery, hormone therapy, radiation, or targeted therapy.

The prognosis is dependent on the specific disease and stage of the patient.

### Drug Response

There have been several studies investigating the drug responses associated with the mutations in the FN1 gene. For example, the drug EDB-FN polypeptide vaccine has been developed for the treatment of solid tumors expressing fibronectin's Extra Domain-B.
