# Information on gene DEK

## Genetic Position
The DEK gene is located on chromosome 6 at the position 27.1 (6p23).

## Pathology
Mutations in DEK have been associated with various types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, bladder cancer, and melanoma.

## Function for gene
DEK is involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. It is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis.

- Aliases: DKFZp686C24270, MKL, C-26

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
rs772799064 (p.Leu186Pro) is a missense mutation found in AML patients

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in DEK associated with cancer. Some examples include:
- rs796052108 (p.Glu2Lys) found in bladder carcinoma
- rs771657084 (p.Glu39Val) found in cutaneous melanoma
- rs796052108 (p.Leu325fs) found in endometrial carcinoma

## Related disease
Mutations in DEK have been associated with various types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, bladder cancer, and melanoma.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for cancer associated with DEK mutations is dependent on the specific type and stage of cancer.

## Drug response
There is limited information on drug response for cancer associated with DEK mutations.
