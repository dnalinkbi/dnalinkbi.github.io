# Information on Gene SRD5A2

## Gene Information
- Function: The SRD5A2 gene encodes for the steroid 5-alpha reductase type 2 enzyme, which is involved in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 2 (2p23.2)
- Alias: SRD5A2, 5-ARD, DHTR, SRD5A3

- HGNC: 11205
- NCBI Entrez: 6716
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137868
- OMIM: 607306
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P31213

## Mutations
- AA Mutation List:
    - R59C
    - A65D
    - T49M
    - V89L
    - E78K
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs9282858, rs523349, rs1047057, rs5934507, rs2235360

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: rs61744943

## Related Disease
- Inherited 5-alpha reductase 2 deficiency (SRD5A2 deficiency)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment for inherited 5-alpha reductase 2 deficiency involves hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with an androgen, such as testosterone, to promote virilization during puberty.
- Prognosis for individuals with this condition vary, but androgen supplementation can lead to improvement in quality of life.

## Drug Response
- The SRD5A2 gene is associated with drug response to finasteride, which is used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and male pattern baldness.
