## Information about gene UGT1A4

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** UGT1A4 gene is located on chromosome 2q37.1. 
- **Pathology:** Mutations in this gene can cause hyperbilirubinemia. 
- **Function:** UGT1A4 encodes for an enzyme called UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-4, which is responsible for the glucuronidation of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds, including bilirubin, drugs, and toxic compounds. 

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location

- **External IDs:** HGNC:12554, NCBI Gene:54660, Ensembl:ENSG00000136997, OMIM:606402, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P22310
- **Aliases:** UGT1A9, UDPGT, UDPGT 1-9, UDPGT1A, UDPGT1A9, UGT1A
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2q37.1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- No AA mutations have been reported for UGT1A4 in ClinVar or COSMIC. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for UGT1A4 in dbSNP.

### Related Disease

- **Hyperbilirubinemia:** Mutations in UGT1A4 gene are associated with hyperbilirubinemia, which is a condition in which there is an excess of the pigment bilirubin in the blood. This can cause jaundice and other symptoms.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for hyperbilirubinemia caused by UGT1A4 mutations involves management of symptoms, such as phototherapy, IV fluids, and exchange transfusions. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

### Drug Response

- UGT1A4 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Polymorphisms in this gene can affect an individual's response to certain medications, including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
