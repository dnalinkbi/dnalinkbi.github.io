## Gene information for SLC16A2

### Gene location, pathology, and function
SLC16A2 gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome X (Xq13.2). This gene encodes the protein MCT8 (Monocarboxylate transporter 8), which is responsible for thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) transport. Mutations in SLC16A2 cause a rare X-linked disorder called Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), characterized by severe intellectual disability and a delayed myelination in the central nervous system.

### Gene function
SLC16A2 gene is involved in the active transportation of thyroid hormones across the cell membrane. The protein encoded by SLC16A2 gene is mainly expressed in the liver, neurons and pituitary. Mutations in this gene can result in a thyroid hormone deficiency and lead to the development of AHDS.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the SLC16A2 gene.

### Related disease
SLC16A2 gene mutations cause Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS). AHDS is an X-linked disorder that primarily affects males. Symptoms of this condition include severe intellectual disability and delayed development of motor skills.

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for AHDS. Treatment is supportive and focused on managing symptoms. Early intervention with physical and speech therapies can be helpful in improving the child's abilities. Prognosis for individuals affected with AHDS is poor.

### Drug response
There is no established drug therapy for AHDS. However, Thyroid hormones may be used to manage symptoms of the condition.
