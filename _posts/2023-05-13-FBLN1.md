# Gene Information for FBLN1

## Genetic Position
FBLN1 (Fibulin-1) is located on chromosome 22 from base pair 29,267,398 to base pair 29,328,800.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FBLN1 gene have been associated with a number of conditions, including age-related macular degeneration, cutis laxa, and familial colorectal cancer.

## Function
FBLN1 encodes a glycoprotein that plays a role in cell adhesion, differentiation, and migration. It is also involved in the maintenance of extracellular matrix structure.

## Related Disease
Variants in FBLN1 have been associated with a number of conditions, including:
- Age-related macular degeneration (OMIM:153800)
- Cutis laxa, autosomal dominant (OMIM:123700)
- Colorectal cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis, type 1 (OMIM:120430)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments for FBLN1-related conditions. Treatment options depend on the specific condition and its severity. Prognosis also varies depending on the specific condition and severity.

## Drug response
There is currently no information available about drug responses for FBLN1-related conditions.
