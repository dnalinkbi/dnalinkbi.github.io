# Gene: SIGMAR1
- Function for gene: 
The SIGMAR1 gene encodes the sigma-1 receptor, a transmembrane protein that is involved in various cellular functions such as Ca2+ homeostasis, membrane lipid regulation, and cell survival. It modulates receptor signaling pathways, ion channels, and neurotransmitter release, contributing to pain modulation, addiction, and mood disorders.

  - Gln2Pro (rs17070145)
  - Asp126Glu (rs17186008)
  - Thr113Met (rs35455142)

There are several SNVs/InDels reported in SIGMAR1. Some examples are:
  - rs45429714
  - rs151318632

- Related disease:
The SIGMAR1 gene has been associated with various diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and drug addiction.

- Treatment and prognosis:
Treatment options for diseases related to SIGMAR1 vary depending on the specific condition. For ALS, no cure has been found yet, but different medications and therapies can help manage symptoms. For Alzheimer's disease, current treatments focus on managing cognitive and behavioral symptoms, but no disease-modifying therapies are available yet. For psychiatric disorders, treatments include psychotherapy, medication, and, in some cases, electroconvulsive therapy.

- Drug response:
The SIGMAR1 receptor is a target for several drugs, such as fluvoxamine and haloperidol, used for the treatment of mood disorders and schizophrenia, respectively. Additionally, some compounds that bind specifically to the sigma-1 receptor, such as PRE-084, have shown potential therapeutic effects in neurological disorders.
