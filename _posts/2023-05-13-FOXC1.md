# Gene FOXC1:

## Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 6
- Start Position: 161,791,932 bp
- End Position: 161,804,415 bp

## Pathology:
- Mutations in FOXC1 lead to disorders related to ocular and craniofacial development such as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome, and Peter's anomaly.

## Function:
- FOXC1 gene encodes for a transcription factor that plays a critical role during embryonic development. It regulates the formation of several organs including the eyes, skin, and teeth.

## External IDs and Aliases:
- Gene ID: 2296
- Genomic Location: NC_000006.12 (161,791,932..161,804,415)
- Aliases:
    - ARA
    - IHG1
    - IGDA2
    - FKHL7
    - FREAC-3
    - IRID1


## Related Diseases:
- Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
- Iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome
- Peter's anomaly

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg120Cys (rs28936677)
- p.Ser25Ser (rs61751343)
- p.Ser170Ser (rs61751342)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.806A>G (rs267607951)
- c.893A>G (rs375777672)
- c.973G>A (rs267607952)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment depends on the specific disorder caused by mutations in the FOXC1 gene.
- Individuals with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome often require lifelong management of glaucoma. 
- Peter's anomaly may require surgical intervention to preserve vision.

## Drug Response:
- There is currently no drug designed specifically for the treatment of FOXC1-related disorders. However, glaucoma treatment can include the use of eye drops, pills, or surgery.
