# Information about gene RBL1

## Genetic Position
The RBL1 gene, also known as Retinoblastoma-like 1, is located on chromosome 20q11.2.

## Pathology
The RBL1 gene is known to play a role in cell cycle regulation and acts as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in this gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia.

## Function
The RBL1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in cell cycle regulation and acts as a tumor suppressor. The protein interacts with other cell cycle regulators and inhibits the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S phase.
