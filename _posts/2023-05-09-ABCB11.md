# Information about Gene ABCB11

## Gene Position
The ABCB11 gene is located on chromosome 2q24.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ABCB11 gene have been linked to several liver diseases, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC).

## Function
The ABCB11 gene encodes a protein called the bile salt export pump (BSEP), which plays a critical role in transporting bile salts from the liver to the intestines for digestion.

Not Available

## Related Disease
Mutations in ABCB11 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis
- Cholestasis. Intrahepatic, Progressive, Familial 2
- Cholestasis, Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic 2 
- ICP2

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options include pharmacological treatments to reduce bile salt synthesis, liver transplantation or partial biliary diversion procedures. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment.

## Drug response
ABCB11 plays a critical role as a drug transporter in the liver. Some drugs have been shown to interact with BSEP, leading to drug-induced liver injury (DILI).
