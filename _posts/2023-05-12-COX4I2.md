## Information about gene COX4I2

### Genetic Position
The gene COX4I2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at position 16q24.3.

### Pathology
The studies on COX4I2 gene revealed that it is associated with several cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer. Mutations in this gene have also been linked to Leigh syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in mitochondrial energy metabolism.

### Function
The COX4I2 gene codes for a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is an essential enzyme in the respiratory chain. COX catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, generating a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that is used for ATP synthesis.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic variants (SNVs/InDels) in COX4I2 that have been identified in various cancer types through next-generation sequencing. Here are some of the variants and their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- c.324G>A (Missense), rs779865986
- c.77C>T (Missense), rs781165053

- c.89G>A (Missense), rs751754915

### Related Disease
COX4I2 mutations have been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by the progressive loss of cognitive and motor function.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments for patients with COX4I2 mutations. Treatment is generally supportive and aimed at reducing symptoms associated with the disease.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response related to COX4I2 mutations.
