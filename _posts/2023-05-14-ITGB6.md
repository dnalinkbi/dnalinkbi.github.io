# Gene: ITGB6

### Function:
The ITGB6 gene encodes a cell surface receptor protein that belongs to the integrin family. Integrins play an important role in cell adhesion and signaling. ITGB6 specifically binds to the extracellular matrix protein laminin and it is involved in processes such as wound healing and tissue remodeling.

### External IDs and Genomic Location:
- HGNC: 6152
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 3694
- Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000163220
- Genomic location: Chromosome 2, 133,529,430-133,619,566.

### Aliases:
- Integrin beta-6
- CD49 antigen-like family member F
- ITB6

### AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID: 
No pathogenic AA mutations have been reported in the ITGB6 gene according to ClinVar's database. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
According to cBioPortal, ITGB6 has not been reported as frequently mutated in any types of tumors.

### Related Diseases:
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): ITGB6 gene has been proposed as a potential biomarker for the severity of IBD. 
- Oral cancer: ITGB6 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for oral squamous cell carcinoma.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no specific treatment available for ITGB6-related diseases. However, since ITGB6 has been implicated in several diseases, a better understanding of its role in disease pathogenesis may lead to the development of new therapies in the future.

### Drug Response:
There are no drugs currently approved targeting ITGB6. However, there are ongoing clinical trials testing drugs that inhibit integrins in general, which may have potential to treat ITGB6-related diseases.
