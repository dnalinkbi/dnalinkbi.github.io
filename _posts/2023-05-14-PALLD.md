# Gene Information Analysis for PALLD

## Gene Overview

PALLD is a gene located on the chromosome 4q21.23. It encodes a cytoskeletal protein known as palladin. Palladin is involved in actin organization, cell motility, and adhesion, which makes it important for cellular functions such as cell migration and invasion. PALLD is also associated with a variety of diseases including cancer and neurological disorders.

## Function for Gene

The PALLD gene is responsible for the production of the palladin protein, which is important for maintaining the cytoskeleton of the cell. Palladin is involved in the organization of actin filaments, which help cells maintain their shape and move. It also plays a role in cell adhesion by interacting with the extracellular matrix, which allows cells to remain attached to other cells and surfaces.
