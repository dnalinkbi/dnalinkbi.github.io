# Gene Information

**Gene Name**: Calumenin (CALU)

**Function**: The CALU gene encodes for a protein that belongs to the CREC (Cab45/RCN1/Erv29p/Calumenin) family of low-affinity calcium-binding proteins. The protein is involved in calcium homeostasis, protein folding, and calcium-mediated signaling processes. 

**External IDs**: 
- HGNC: 1455 
- NCBI Entrez: 811 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000103426 
- OMIM: 114280 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P27797 

**Aliases**: LACD, ERC-55, UNQ248/PRO284, Calcium-binding protein 4
