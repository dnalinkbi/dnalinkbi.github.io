## Information about gene NLRP12

- **Genetic position:** NLRP12 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.42).

- **Pathology:** Mutations in NLRP12 gene have been associated with multiple inflammatory diseases such as periodic fever syndromes, colitis, and psoriasis.

- **Function:** NLRP12 protein belongs to the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family and plays a role in the regulation of the immune response. It acts as a negative regulator of inflammation by inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway and suppressing cytokine production.

- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 24995
    - NCBI Entrez: 91662
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105650
    - OMIM: 609648
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NW55

- **Aliases:** NALP12, PYPAF7, CLR19.1

- **AA mutation list:**
    - p.Gln388Arg
    - p.Val55Ile
    - p.Arg284Gln
    - p.Gly904Arg
    - p.Ala734Thr

- **Mutation types and dbSNP ID:**
    - Missense mutation: rs121917864
    - Frameshift deletion: rs796052166
    - Splice site mutation: rs370169358

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs369774164
    - rs864309201

- **Related diseases:** 
    - Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 2 (FCAS2)
    - Psoriasis
    - Multiple sclerosis
    - Inflammatory bowel disease
    - Blau syndrome

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no cure for NLRP12-associated diseases. Treatment is mainly based on symptom relief using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

- **Drug response:** Some ongoing clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of Canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-1Î², in the treatment of NLRP12-associated autoinflammatory diseases.
