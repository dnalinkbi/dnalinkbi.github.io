# Gene RHD

**Genetic position**
- The RHD gene is located on chromosome 1 at position p36.11.

**Pathology**
- The RHD gene encodes a protein called RhD antigen, which is expressed on the surface of red blood cells. Mutations in the RHD gene can cause RhD-negative blood, which results in the absence of RhD antigen on red blood cells. This can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn if the mother is RhD-negative and the fetus is RhD-positive.

**Function for gene**
- The RHD gene encodes a protein that is involved in the Rh blood group system. The RhD antigen is responsible for the D antigen in the system and plays a role in the transport of carbon dioxide and ammonia across cell membranes.

**Related disease**
- Hemolytic disease of the newborn
- Rh incompatibility

**Treatment and prognosis**
- The treatment for hemolytic disease of the newborn includes phototherapy and blood transfusions. In severe cases, an exchange transfusion may be necessary.
- The prognosis for hemolytic disease of the newborn depends on the severity of the condition and the stage at which it is diagnosed and treated.

**Drug response**
- Individuals with Rh-negative blood may need an Rh immunoglobulin injection to prevent their immune system from attacking Rh-positive blood cells.
