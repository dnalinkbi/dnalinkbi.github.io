# Gene ARMS2

**Function:** The ARMS2 gene encodes a protein called age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), which plays a role in the regulation of complement system activation.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 18096
- NCBI Entrez: 387715
- Ensembl: ENSG00000186092
- OMIM: 611313
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N5J7

**Aliases:** LOC387715, LOC647070, MGC34554

**AA Mutation List:**

| AA change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| R38S | Missense | rs10490924 |
| A69S | Missense | rs11200638 |
| L9H | Missense | rs3750846 |
| H172R | Missense | rs10490924 |
| I62V | Missense | rs10490924 |
| Del433-434 | Deletion | rs144848 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the ARMS2 gene.

**Related Disease:**

ARMS2 gene mutations have been associated with several retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Currently, there is no cure for AMD or PCV. Treatment options include photodynamic therapy, anti-VEGF injections, and dietary modifications. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment.

**Drug Response:**

Studies have suggested that genetic variations in the ARMS2 gene may affect the response to anti-VEGF therapy in individuals with AMD.
