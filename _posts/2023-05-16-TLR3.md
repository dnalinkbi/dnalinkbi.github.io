## Information about Gene TLR3:

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4: 39,358,294-39,369,858 (GRCh38.p13)

- **Pathology:** TLR3 gene is associated with various diseases, including viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

- **Function for Gene:** The TLR3 gene encodes for toll-like receptor 3, which is a type of transmembrane receptor that recognizes double-stranded RNA and initiates an immune response against viral infections.

    - Herpes simplex encephalitis
    - Viral encephalitis
    - Systemic lupus erythematosus
    - Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Prostate cancer
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for TLR3 related disorders involves antiviral therapy and immunosuppressant medications. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the symptoms.

- **Drug Response:** There are several drugs that target the TLR3 pathway and show promising results in clinical trials. The TLR3 agonists are in development for the treatment of viral infections, cancer, and immune-related disorders.
