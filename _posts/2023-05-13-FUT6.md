# Gene FUT6

**Function:** FUT6 encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 6, which adds a fucose molecule to the terminal galactose residue of N-glycans and O-glycans. This modification is involved in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling.

**External IDs:**

- Ensembl: ENSG00000121078
- OMIM: 613852
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51993

**Aliases:** Fucosyltransferase 6, Alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 6, FUT3B.
