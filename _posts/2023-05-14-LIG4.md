# Gene Information for LIG4

## Gene Position
LIG4 gene is located on chromosome 13q33.3.

## Pathology
The LIG4 gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme Ligase IV. This enzyme is involved in the repairing of DNA damage that affects both strands of the DNA molecule. Mutations in this gene lead to DNA repair deficiency, which contributes to many health conditions such as LIG4 syndrome.

## Function
The Ligase IV enzyme catalyzes the final step of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) mechanism for DNA repair. The NHEJ pathway is responsible for repairing double-stranded breaks in DNA caused by ionizing radiation or reactive oxygen species.

| p.Pro871Leu | Missense | rs121918985 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are various somatic SNVs and InDels in the LIG4 gene, and some of the dbSNP IDs associated with them are listed below:

- rs786205889
- rs770492224
- rs780881144
- rs780106548
- rs760599941

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the LIG4 gene cause LIG4 syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for LIG4 syndrome. The prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the extent of immune deficiency.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs available for LIG4 syndrome.
