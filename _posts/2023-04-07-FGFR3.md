# Gene: FGFR3

## Information
- Position: Chromosome 4 (4p16.3)
- Pathology: Mutations in this gene have been associated with skeletal dysplasia and increased risk for some cancers.
- Function: FGFR3 belongs to the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases which plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

- NCBI Entrez: 2261
- Ensembl: ENSG00000068078
- OMIM: 134934

- Thanatophoric dysplasia type I and II
- SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans)
- Cervical cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Multiple myeloma

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for skeletal dysplasia may include limb lengthening surgeries, spinal fusion procedures, physical therapy, and medication to manage pain.
- Treatment options for cancers associated with mutations in FGFR3 vary depending on the type and stage of cancer.
- Prognosis is also dependent on the type and stage of the disease.

## Drug Response
- FGFR inhibitors such as Debio 1347, Erdafitinib, and BGJ398 have shown promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials targeting cancers with FGFR3 mutations.
