# Information about Gene ITGAV

## Genetic Position
* Chromosome: 2
* Location: 2q31.1
* Strand: -
* Genomic start: 176,098,346 bp
* Genomic end: 176,234,285 bp


## Function for Gene
* ITGAV encodes an integrin alpha subunit that forms a heterodimer with beta subunits and functions as a cell surface receptor for various extracellular matrix molecules.
* It plays a key role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and signalling.
* Integrins are involved in a variety of physiological processes, such as embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, and immune response.

## Related Disease
* ITGAV has been associated with different diseases including cancer, osteoporosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Some studies suggest that ITGAV polymorphisms may increase the risk of certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.


## Treatment and Prognosis
* Potential treatment approaches for ITGAV-related diseases include targeting integrins or related signalling pathways.
* Prognosis and treatment vary depending on the specific disease and individual factors.


## Drug Response
* Integrin-targeted therapies have shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies for certain types of cancer.
* Examples of integrin inhibitors that have been investigated for cancer treatment include cilengitide and volociximab.
