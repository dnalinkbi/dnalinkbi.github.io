## Gene Information: LRP6 

### Genetic Position
LRP6 (Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13.3).

### Pathology and Function
LRP6 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the LDL receptor protein family. The protein functions as a co-receptor for Wnt signaling pathway and regulates embryonic development, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Mutations in LRP6 gene have been associated with various diseases, including osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, coronary artery disease, and cancer.
