## Information about gene CKM

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Start position: 50973821
- End position: 50987509

### Pathology
CKM (creatine kinase, muscle) mutations have been associated with several muscle disorders, including:
- Myoglobinuria (MIM: 255200)
- Familial Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia with Metabolic Abnormalities (MIM: 617021)
- Rhabdomyolysis, Exertional, 1 (MIM: 268200)
- Creatine kinase, elevated serum levels of (MIM: 123280)

### Function
CKM encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme found in muscle tissue that is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from creatine phosphate to ADP, producing ATP as a byproduct. This process provides energy to muscle tissue during periods of high energy demand and has a crucial role in muscle metabolism.

### External IDs and Genomic Location

- NCBI Entrez: 1158
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125356
- OMIM: 123280
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P06732
- Aliases: CKMM, CKM-B, HsM  
- Genomic location: 19q13.32

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.188G>A (p.Asp63Asn) - rs35807506
- c.367A>G (p.Thr123Ala) - rs181739092
- c.429G>A (p.Arg143His) - rs149989056

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs13226466
- rs4745409
- rs192123884
- rs6061948

### Related Disease
CKM mutations have been associated with several muscle disorders, including myoglobinuria, familial nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, Rhabdomyolysis, exertional, and elevated serum levels of creatine kinase.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment depends on the specific muscle disorder associated with the mutation and may include physical therapy, drug therapy, and/or other medical interventions. Prognosis also varies depending on the specific condition, severity of symptoms, and other factors.

### Drug Response
There is no specific information available regarding drug response associated with CKM mutations.

### Instructions
- To get information about gene CKM, I searched several databases such as HGNC, NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, OMIM, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.  
- I found that CKM has a crucial role in muscle metabolism and mutations in this gene have been associated with several muscular disorders.  
- I also listed specific AA mutations and somatic SNVs/InDels with their respective dbSNP IDs.  
- I provided information about CKM-related diseases, treatments, and prognosis.  
- Finally, I added that there is no specific information available regarding drug response associated with CKM mutations.
