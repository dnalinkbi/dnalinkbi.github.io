# Gene FOXA3

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 19 (19q13.43)
- **Aliases:** Forkhead Box A3, HNF3G, Transcription factor 7-like 3

## Function
FOXA3 is a member of the forkhead box transcription factor family and plays a crucial role in development, differentiation, and metabolism of various tissues including liver, lung, gut, and pancreas. It acts as a pioneer transcription factor that binds to chromatin and facilitates the recruitment of other transcriptional regulators, thus affecting gene expression and cell fate.
