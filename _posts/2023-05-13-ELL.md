# Gene ELL Information

## Genetic Position
Gene ELL (RNA Polymerase II Elongation Factor ELL) is located on chromosome 19q13.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ELL gene have been associated with a few diseases including mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

## Function
The ELL gene encodes a protein that interacts with RNA polymerase II and plays a critical role in transcriptional elongation. This protein is also involved in RNA splicing and mRNA transport.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 3357
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 8178
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000062650
- OMIM ID: 600284
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9UHL9
- Aliases: Eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia protein, RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL, P-TEFb stimulatory factor A, AFF-1 homolog A, elongin-A elongation factor, and others.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg521Cys (rs376221541): missense mutation
- p.Lys53Ile (rs138797952): missense mutation

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs1800925: non-coding SNV
- rs1800926: non-coding SNV

## Related Disease
Some diseases that are associated with mutations in the ELL gene include:
- Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)
- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for ELL-related diseases, but standard treatments for leukemia may be effective. The prognosis for individuals with ELL mutations may be worse than those without mutations.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug responses specific to ELL mutations.
