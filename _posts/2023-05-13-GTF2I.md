# Information about Gene GTF2I

## Genetic Position
- Gene: GTF2I
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 7q11.23
- Pathology: Microdeletion syndrome

## Function
- The GTF2I gene encodes a multifunctional protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, and DNA repair.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:4610
- NCBI Entrez ID: 2969
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000103495
- OMIM ID: 600002
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8N3U4
- Aliases: BAP-135, BAP135, FMR2, SPIN

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations reported in the GTF2I gene, including:
- p.Arg218Cys (rs760626432)
- p.Gly518Ser (rs368236750)
- p.Arg653Cys (rs756106785)
- p.Arg843His (rs748786740)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNV/InDel with dbSNP ID has been reported for this gene.

## Related Disease
Microdeletion syndrome is associated with loss of the GTF2I gene and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features.

## Treatment and Prognosis
No specific treatment is available for microdeletion syndrome caused by the loss of the GTF2I gene. The prognosis may vary from case to case depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with mutations in the GTF2I gene.
