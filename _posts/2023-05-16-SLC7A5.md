# Gene: SLC7A5 

## Genetic Position
SLC7A5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.2). It spans a region of about 38.05 kb and is composed of 15 exons. 

## Pathology
SLC7A5 is involved in the transport of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) across cell membranes. Mutations in the gene have been associated with System L aminoaciduria, a rare inherited disorder characterized by excessive excretion of LNAAs in the urine.

## Function 
SLC7A5 is a sodium-independent transporter that is responsible for the uptake of LNAAs, such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, in various tissues. These amino acids are important for the synthesis of proteins and neurotransmitters, and their transport is essential for normal cellular growth and differentiation.

- rs764683317
- rs148566982

## Related diseases
- System L aminoaciduria
- Hypoplastic Amelogenesis Imperfecta

## Treatment and prognosis
For System L aminoaciduria, there is no specific treatment yet but symptomatic therapy may be provided. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug response
SLC7A5 has been implicated in the response to certain anticancer agents, such as melphalan and the targeted drug, bortezomib. Its inhibition has been shown to sensitize tumour cells to these drugs.
