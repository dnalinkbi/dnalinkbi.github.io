# Gene SMC3 Information

### Genetic Position:
The SMC3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q25.2).

### Pathology:
Mutations in the SMC3 gene have been associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental problems, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features.

### Function:
SMC3 encodes a subunit of the cohesion complex that plays a role in chromosome segregation and DNA repair.
