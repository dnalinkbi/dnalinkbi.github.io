# Gene ERCC2 

## Information about Gene 

- **Function:** The ERCC2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the repair of damaged DNA by acting as a helicase enzyme. This protein is a part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which helps to remove DNA damage caused by factors such as ultraviolet radiation and environmental toxins. 

- **External IDs:** 

  - Gene ID: 2068 
  - Genomic location: 19q13.32 
  - Aliases: XPD, TFIIH, COFS2

- **Related Diseases:** ERCC2 mutations are associated with the following diseases:

  - Xeroderma Pigmentosum 
  - Cockayne Syndrome 
  - Trichothiodystrophy 
  - Cerebrooculofacioskeletal Syndrome 

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options vary depending on the specific disease caused by ERCC2 mutations. There is currently no cure for these conditions, but supportive therapy can help manage symptoms. The prognosis is generally poor, with a high risk of cancer and other complications.

- **Drug Response:** ERCC2 mutations may affect how patients respond to chemotherapy and other cancer treatments.
