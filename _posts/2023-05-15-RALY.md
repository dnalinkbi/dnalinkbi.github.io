# Gene RALY

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 20q11.23

**Aliases**: RNA binding protein Raly, hnRNP-associated with lethal yellow protein homolog

**Function**: The RALY gene codes for a RNA-binding protein, RALY, which belongs to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. This protein has multiple functions, including regulation of alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. It also plays a role in the cellular response to stress and is involved in the DNA damage response.

**Related Disease**: No specific disease is known to be directly associated with RALY mutations.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: As of now, there are no known targeted treatments for RALY mutations. As with many genetic mutations, the prognosis will depend on the specific nature and severity of the mutation and its impact on RALY function.

**Drug Response**: Due to lack of information, there is no known drug response to RALY mutations.
