# Information about Gene NOP10

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: NOP10 gene is located on the chromosome 15q14.
- **Pathology**: There are no significant associations of NOP10 mutations with human diseases reported yet.
- **Function**: NOP10 encodes a protein component of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complexes, which are involved in the processing and modification of specific RNAs. NOP10 is essential for the stability and function of H/ACA snoRNP complexes, thus regulating the expression of genes involved in various cellular pathways.
