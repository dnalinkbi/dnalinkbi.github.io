- Related disease: STAG2 mutations have been found in several types of cancers, including bladder cancer, glioblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. 

- Treatment and prognosis: the prognosis and treatment options for STAG2 mutations depend on the type and stage of cancer.

- Drug response: STAG2 mutations may affect drug response and resistance in certain types of cancer, but more research is needed in this area.
