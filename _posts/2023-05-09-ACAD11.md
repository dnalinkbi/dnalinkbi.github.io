## Gene ACAD11 Information

### Genetic Position
Gene ACAD11 is located on chromosome 2 at position 2q34.

### Pathology
Mutations in ACAD11 gene have been associated with multiple systemic symptoms and rare diseases such as Leigh syndrome, infantile and childhood-onset encephalomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy. 

### Function
ACAD11 gene encodes for a mitochondrial enzyme named acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 11, which is responsible for the Î²-oxidation of fatty acids with chain-lengths of 6 to 16 carbon atoms.

### Related Disease
ACAD11 mutations have been associated with multiple systemic symptoms and rare diseases such as Leigh syndrome, infantile and childhood-onset encephalomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for ACAD11 related diseases. Treatment options aim to mitigate the symptoms such as seizures, developmental delays, and lactic acidosis. The prognosis largely depends on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
There are no known drugs that specifically target ACAD11 gene. However, drug therapies such as L-carnitine, sodium pyruvate, and thiamine have been used to manage some of the symptoms.
