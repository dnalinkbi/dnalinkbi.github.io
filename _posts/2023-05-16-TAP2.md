# Gene TAP2

## Information

Gene TAP2 is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3). This gene provides instructions for making a protein known as transporter associated with antigen processing 2, which plays a vital role in the immune system by helping to present foreign proteins (antigens) to the immune cells. 

Mutations or alterations in TAP2 gene can lead to the dysfunction of the transporter protein and hinder the immune system's ability to detect and fight against harmful invaders. These alterations can cause the susceptibility to various autoimmune and infectious diseases.

## Function
TAP2 plays a vital role in the immune system by helping to present foreign proteins (antigens) to T cells, which are immune cells that direct and regulate the body's immune response. The TAP2 protein is involved in the transportation of these antigens to the cell surface of immune cells where they can be recognized by T cells and attacked by the immune system.

## Related disease
Several autoimmune and infectious diseases have been associated with TAP2 mutations, such as:
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- Psoriasis
- Behcet's disease
- Tuberculosis susceptibility
- Leprosy susceptibility
- Common variable immunodeficiency
- Celiac disease

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for TAP2-related diseases depend on the type and severity of the condition, but in general, the management of these disorders includes the use of immunosuppressive drugs, antibiotics, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

## Drug response
Multiple studies have suggested that the expression levels or the functionality of TAP2 gene could influence the efficacy of certain drugs which are substrates of the TAP2 transporter protein, like some immunomodulatory or antiviral agents.
