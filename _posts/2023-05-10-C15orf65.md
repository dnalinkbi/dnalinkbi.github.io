**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for gene C15orf65.

**Related disease:** C15orf65 mutations are associated with mitochondrial complex III deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the function of mitochondrial complex III leading to a variety of symptoms including muscle weakness, respiratory distress, growth retardation, and lactic acidosis.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no specific treatment for mitochondrial complex III deficiency. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive, and patients require lifelong medical supervision.

**Drug response:** There are no drug response records for gene C15orf65.
