# Information about gene JAZF1

## Gene Position and Aliases

JAZF1, also known as Zinc finger protein with KRAB and SCAN domains 1, is located on chromosomal position 7q32.1. Other aliases for this gene include:

- ZNF802
- TIP27
- ZNF352
- JJAZ1
- Zfp402

## Function for Gene

JAZF1 plays a role in regulating gene expression and has been linked to various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. It has also been shown to be involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.
