# Gene Information: TOP1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Location: 20q12-q13.1

## Pathology
TOP1 gene mutations are associated with various types of cancer including lung cancer and breast cancer.

## Function
The TOP1 gene encodes for the DNA topoisomerase I enzyme which is responsible for the relaxation of DNA supercoiling and the regulation of DNA replication and transcription.

## Treatment and Prognosis
TOP1 inhibitors are used in the treatment of various cancers, however, treating TOP1 mutated cancers can lead to drug resistance and poor prognosis.

## Drug Response
Camptothecin is a TOP1 inhibitor use in the treatment of certain cancers.
