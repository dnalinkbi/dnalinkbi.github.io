## Information about Gene DGCR2

### Genetic Position:
DGCR2, also known as DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 2, is located on the human chromosome 22q11.2. 

### Pathology:
DGCR2 has been linked to genetic diseases such as DiGeorge syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS).

### Function:
DGCR2 encodes for a protein involved in negative regulation of the immune response. It also has a role in the development of the nervous system.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location:
- HGNC ID: 2739
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 8529
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000185899
- OMIM ID: 601492
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O75914
- Alias: DGS-CR2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
There are various coding mutations reported in DGCR2. Here are some examples with their respective dbSNP IDs and mutation types: 
- p.Leu44Pro (rs143500160) missense mutation
- p.Gly132Asp (rs184149705) missense mutation
- p.Asn261Ser (rs781838307) missense mutation

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are some somatic variants in DGCR2 reported in the literature. Examples include: 
- chr22:g.22321021C>T (rs786200262)
- chr22:g.22321020C>G (rs786200263)

### Related Disease:
Defects in DGCR2 have been associated with DiGeorge syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS).

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no specific treatment yet discovered for DGCR2-related diseases. Treatment is focused on the management of symptoms. The prognosis depends on the severity of the syndrome, and varies from individual to individual.

### Drug Response:
There is no specific drug developed yet for the treatment of DGCR2-related diseases.
