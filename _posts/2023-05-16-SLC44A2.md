## Gene Information

The gene SLC44A2 is located on chromosome 19 at position 19q13.32. It has an mRNA length of 6,166 base pairs and encodes a protein consisting of 708 amino acids. SLC44A2 is also known by its aliases, including CDw329, KIAA0345, and CTL2.

### Function

SLC44A2 encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as a transporter for choline and other organic cations. It plays a crucial role in the transport and metabolic pathways of choline, which is necessary for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs

According to the COSMIC database, there are 17 somatic mutations reported for SLC44A2, including SNVs and InDels. Some of these mutations, along with their dbSNP IDs, are as follows:

- c.1607G>A (p.Gly536Arg, rs1057519844)
- c.259A>G (p.Asn87Ser, rs1057519833)

- c.781_784del (p.Arg261fs, rs1057519843)

### Related Disease and Treatment/Prognosis

SLC44A2 is associated with several diseases, including breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. Its overexpression has been linked to the progression of breast cancer by contributing to the proliferation of cancer cells. In Alzheimer's disease, decreased expression of SLC44A2 has been observed in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory. Schizophrenia has also been linked to the gene, with studies suggesting that its expression plays a role in the development and progression of the disease.

There is no specific treatment or prognosis associated with SLC44A2-related diseases at this time.

### Drug Response

There is limited information available on the drug response of SLC44A2.
