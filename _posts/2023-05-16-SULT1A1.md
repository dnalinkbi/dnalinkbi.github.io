# Information on Gene SULT1A1

## Genetic Position
The SULT1A1 gene is located on chromosome 16q12.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SULT1A1 gene are associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and breast cancer.

## Function
The SULT1A1 gene encodes an enzyme called sulfotransferase 1A1 which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs and hormones by transferring sulfate groups to their substrates.
