## Gene Information for UBAC2

### Genetic Position
The UBAC2 gene is located on chromosome 9q22.31.

### Pathology
Mutations in the UBAC2 gene have been suggested to be associated with autism and psychopathy, through impairments of synaptic stability and transmission.

### Function for Gene 
The UBAC2 gene is involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking through the interaction with the sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) protein, and the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It plays a central role in membrane trafficking between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, and shuttles proteins from the plasma membrane to endosomes.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for UBAC2.

### Related Disease
Studies have suggested that mutations in UBAC2 are associated with autism and psychopathy, potentially through disruptions to synaptic transmission and membrane trafficking.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There are no specific treatments for UBAC2 mutations. Treatment for associated conditions, such as autism, is largely supportive and symptomatic.

### Drug Response
No known drug response associations have been reported for UBAC2.
