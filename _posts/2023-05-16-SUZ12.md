# Information about Gene SUZ12

## Gene Position
The SUZ12 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q11.2).

## Pathology
Mutations in the SUZ12 gene have been implicated in several cancer types such as colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. 

## Function for Gene
The SUZ12 gene codes for a protein component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that plays a critical role in gene expression regulation through histone modifications. Specifically, SUZ12 is involved in the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), a process that helps repress gene transcription and thus regulate cellular differentiation.

## Related Disease
SUZ12 mutations have been associated with several cancer types such as:
- Colorectal Cancer
- Endometrial Cancer
- Ovarian Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting SUZ12 could provide a therapeutic strategy for cancers where it is involved. However, further studies are required to better understand SUZ12â€™s role in specific cancers and develop effective treatment strategies.

## Drug Response
There is no current drug therapy specifically for SUZ12 mutations; however, the inhibition of PRC2 with small molecules has been shown to be promising in preclinical studies.
