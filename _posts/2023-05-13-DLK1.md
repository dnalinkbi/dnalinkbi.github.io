# Gene: DLK1

## Genetic position
DLK1 (Delta-like 1 homolog) gene is located on chromosome 14q32.2. It spans approximately 1.6 kb and contains 2 exons.

## Pathology
DLK1 gene expression has been found to be associated with several diseases and conditions including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Function
DLK1 is a transmembrane protein that functions as an inhibitor of adipogenesis. It plays an important role in regulating the balance between adipocyte differentiation and proliferation.

## Related disease
DLK1 is associated with several diseases, including:
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Neurodegenerative disorders
- Cancer

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for DLK1-related disorders depends on the type and severity of the disease. Obesity and diabetes can be managed with lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery. Treatment for neurodegenerative disorders and cancer involves a combination of therapies such as radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery.

Prognosis also depends on the type and severity of the disease. Generally, early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis for DLK1-related disorders.

## Drug response
There is limited information available on the drug response of DLK1-related disorders. However, studies have shown that the inhibition of DLK1 can enhance the differentiation of adipocytes, making it a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes.
