# Information about Gene AVP

## Genetic Position
AVP (Arginine Vasopressin) gene is located on chromosome 20q13.2.

## Pathology 
Mutations in the AVP gene have been linked to several conditions, including Diabetes Insipidus, Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), Polyuria, Hyponatremia, and Hypernatremia.

## Function
AVP encodes the vasopressin peptide hormone, which regulates water balance in the body by controlling water reabsorption in the kidneys. This gene also plays a role in social behavior.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
AVP gene has several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The following are some of the missense mutations with dbSNP ID:

|AA Change|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---------|------------|--------|
|Arg171Cys|Missense|rs1800871|
|Gln4Arg|Missense|rs2228485|
|Phe24Tyr|Missense|rs1800873|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
The AVP gene can also have somatic mutations, which can contribute to certain diseases. The following are some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|------------|--------|
|SNV|rs13276610|
|INDEL|rs3734346|

## Related Disease
AVP gene mutations have been linked to several diseases, including:
- Diabetes Insipidus
- Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)
- Polyuria
- Hyponatremia
- Hypernatremia

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for AVP-related diseases depends on the specific condition and its severity. Treatment may involve medications to enhance water retention (such as desmopressin) or to lower AVP production (such as diuretics). The prognosis also depends on the specific disease and its severity.

## Drug Response
Variants in the AVP gene can affect an individual's drug response to certain medications. For example, certain AVP gene variants have been linked to different responses to lithium treatment for bipolar disorder.
