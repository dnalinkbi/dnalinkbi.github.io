# Information about gene SESN2

## Genetic Position
SESN2 (Sestrin 2) is located on chromosome 1 at the location 1p35.3.

## Pathology
SESN2 is involved in different biological processes such as regulation of oxidative stress, autophagy, and AMPK-related signaling pathways. Mutations in SESN2 are implicated in various diseases including cancer.

## Function for gene
SESN2 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by coordinating cellular responses to stress. It acts as a sensor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulates the redox status of the cell. Additionally, it is involved in modulating autophagy and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways to maintain energy homeostasis in cells.
