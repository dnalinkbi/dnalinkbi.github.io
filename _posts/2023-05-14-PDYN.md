### Gene Information
* **Gene Name:** PDYN
* **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 20, q13.32
* **Aliases:** PDYN alpha, Opioid neuropeptide precursor, Dynorphin, NEO
* **External IDs:** 
    * HGNC: 9058
    * NCBI Entrez: 5173
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000101444
    * OMIM: 131340
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01213

### Function
The PDYN gene encodes a protein known as dynorphin, which is an opioid neuropeptide precursor. Dynorphin plays a role in the modulation of pain and is involved in numerous physiological processes such as stress response, learning, and memory.

### AA Mutation List
There is no comprehensive list of all amino acid mutations in PDYN available. Some known mutations in the PDYN gene include:
* p.Leu51Phe (rs11838905)
* p.Ala45Thr (rs6265)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the PDYN gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the PDYN gene have been associated with various diseases, including drug addiction, alcoholism, depression, and anxiety disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for diseases related to PDYN mutations varies depending on the specific condition. Some treatments include medication, behavioral therapy, and counseling.

### Drug Response
Various drugs have been developed to target the opioid system modulated by dynorphin, such as naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone. Response to treatment with these drugs may vary depending on the individual.
