## Information about Gene CTC1

### Genetic Position

The gene CTC1 (CTC1 homolog, telomere maintenance complex component) is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 17p13.1. 

### Pathology

Mutations in the CTC1 gene have been linked to several diseases. One such disease is Coats plus syndrome which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of the retinal blood vessels (Coats disease), brain abnormalities, and skeletal abnormalities. 

Additionally, mutations in the CTC1 gene have been linked to dyskeratosis congenita (DC), which is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. DC is characterized by abnormalities in the skin, nail, and mucous membranes as well as a predisposition for developing cancer. 

### Function

The CTC1 gene provides instructions for creating a protein that is involved in the maintenance of telomeres, which are the repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes. The protein is a component of a complex that helps to protect and repair telomeres, which are essential for maintaining the stability of chromosomes during cell division.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Unfortunately, there are currently no aa mutations listed for the CTC1 gene in the dbSNP database. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no somatic SNVs or InDels listed for the CTC1 gene in the dbSNP database.  

### Related Disease

As mentioned earlier, mutations in the CTC1 gene have been linked to a number of diseases. One such disease is Coats plus syndrome which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of the retinal blood vessels (Coats disease), brain abnormalities, and skeletal abnormalities. Mutations in CTC1 have also been linked to dyskeratosis congenita (DC), which is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. DC is characterized by abnormalities in the skin, nail, and mucous membranes as well as a predisposition for developing cancer. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, treatment for Coats plus syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita is limited and mainly focused on symptom management. There is no cure for these diseases. Prognosis for individuals with Coats plus syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita varies depending on the severity of the disease and the severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response

Currently, there is no information available on drug response specific to mutations in the CTC1 gene.
