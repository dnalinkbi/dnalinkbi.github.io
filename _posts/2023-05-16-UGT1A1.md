## Information about Gene UGT1A1

### Genetic Position

The UGT1A1 gene is located on chromosome 2 in humans at position 2q37. It spans approximately 86 kilobases of DNA and is composed of five exons.

### Pathology

The UGT1A1 gene encodes for the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism and elimination of drugs, bilirubin, and other endogenous and exogenous compounds. Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene can lead to a deficiency or complete absence of the enzyme. This deficiency is known as Gilbert's syndrome, which is a benign condition characterized by mild jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia.

### Function

The UGT1A1 enzyme is mainly expressed in the liver and catalyzes the glucuronidation of bilirubin, which is a byproduct of the breakdown of hemoglobin. This conjugation reaction is essential for the elimination of bilirubin from the body. UGT1A1 is also involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including irinotecan, which is used to treat colorectal cancer.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- rs1800465 (c. -3279T>G): This variant is a promoter mutation leading to reduced UGT1A1 gene expression and hyperbilirubinemia.
- rs34983651 (c.472G>A; p.Gly158Arg): This variant is associated with Gilbert's syndrome and reduces the activity of the UGT1A1 enzyme.
- rs4148323 (c.434T>G; p.W145G): This variant is associated with Gilbert's syndrome and reduces the activity of the UGT1A1 enzyme.
- rs887829 (c.211G>A; p.Arg71Gln): This variant is associated with decreased UGT1A1 activity and an increased risk of irinotecan toxicity.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the UGT1A1 gene.

### Related Disease

- Gilbert's Syndrome: This is a benign condition characterized by mild jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. It is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene that lead to a deficiency or complete absence of the UGT1A1 enzyme.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Gilbert's syndrome does not require treatment since it is a benign condition. Patients with irinotecan-induced toxicity may require dose adjustments or discontinuation of the drug. The prognosis for patients with Gilbert's syndrome is excellent, and the condition does not affect life expectancy or quality of life.

### Drug Response

Patients with Gilbert's syndrome may have a decreased ability to metabolize drugs that are substrates of the UGT1A1 enzyme, leading to increased toxicity. In contrast, patients with higher UGT1A1 activity may require higher doses of drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme.
