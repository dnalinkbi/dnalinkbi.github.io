# Information about gene TRPM1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
**Gene Name:** TRPM1 (Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 1)<br>
**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 15 (15q13.3)<br>
**Pathology:** TRPM1 mutations are associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), which is a group of non-progressive, inherited retinal disorders characterized by impaired night vision, nystagmus, and reduced visual acuity.<br>
**Function:** TRPM1 encodes a protein involved in the depolarization of rod bipolar cells during the onset of visual stimulation.

## Gene and Genomic Location IDs, Aliases
**Gene ID:** 4474<br>
**Genomic Location ID:** NC_000015.10: 32796245-32976245<br>
**Aliases:** Melastatin 1, LTRPC1, MLSN1

## Related Disease
- Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for CSNB caused by TRPM1 mutations. However, vision aids and low-vision rehabilitation can help improve the quality of life for affected individuals. The prognosis for individuals with TRPM1-related CSNB depends on the severity of symptoms and the degree of visual impairment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on the drug response for TRPM1-related CSNB.
