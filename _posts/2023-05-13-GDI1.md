# Information about Gene GDI1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, Function

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome Xq28
- **Pathology**: GDI1 mutations can cause mental retardation, epileptic seizures, and a wide range of neurological problems.
- **Function for Gene**: The GDI1 gene encodes a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly the recycling of endosomes.
