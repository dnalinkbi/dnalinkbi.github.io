# Gene L1CAM

**Function**: The L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) plays a critical role in axon guidance, neuronal migration, and differentiation. It is also involved in cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion in various cancer types.

**External IDs**: 

- Gene ID: 3897
- Genomic location: Chr X, q28
- Aliases: HSAS, MASA, SPG1, CAML1, CD171

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 

- c.280C>T (p.Ser94Leu) - rs28942078
- c.806A>G (p.Thr269Ala) - rs1052237
- c.864C>T (p.Pro288Leu) - rs1052238
- c.1724T>A (p.Phe575Ile) - rs6224

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:

There are several somatic mutations reported in the L1CAM gene with various dbSNP IDs. Some of them are:

- rs766783898
- rs1057527658
- rs141053643
- rs141053642

**Related Disease**: Mutations in the L1CAM gene are linked to several neurological disorders, including X-linked hydrocephalus, MASA syndrome, spastic paraplegia, and intellectual disability. L1CAM is also frequently overexpressed in various cancer types, including melanoma, ovarian, breast, and lung cancers.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no specific treatment available for L1CAM-related disorders. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptom-based. In cancer, L1CAM-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors, are being developed and tested in clinical trials. L1CAM expression is often associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients.

**Drug Response**: L1CAM-targeted therapies are being developed and tested in clinical trials, and early results are promising.
