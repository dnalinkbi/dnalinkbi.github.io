# Information about gene CEP57

## Genetic Position
- CEP57 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q21.
- It spans 26.46 kb of genomic DNA.

## Pathology and Function
- CEP57 encodes centrosomal protein of 57 kDa which is a structural component of the centrosome.
- The centrosome plays a crucial role in the formation of the microtubule cytoskeleton and in organizing the microtubule-based mitotic spindle necessary for proper cell division.
- Mutation or dysfunction of the CEP57 gene can cause abnormalities in the centrosome function, leading to the development of several cancers, such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and kidney cancer.
