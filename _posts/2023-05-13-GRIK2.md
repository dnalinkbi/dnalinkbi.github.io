# Information about gene GRIK2

## Genetic Position
Gene: GRIK2

Chromosome: 6

Location: 6q16.3

## Pathology and Function
GRIK2 is a genetic information that encodes the glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainate 2 protein. This protein is known to play an important role in synaptic transmission, and is involved in excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain. GRIK2 gene dysfunction or mutation can lead to an increased risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic variants for GRIK2 gene.

## Related Disease
GRIK2 gene mutations have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including:

- Autism spectrum disorder
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar disorder
- Depression

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific condition and severity of the disease. For instance, therapy and medication targeting autism are mostly behavioral, and those targeting schizophrenia involve antipsychotic medications. Early diagnosis and timely treatment remain key factors to improve the prognosis.

## Drug Response
Data on drug responses concerning GRIK2 gene are limited at the moment.
