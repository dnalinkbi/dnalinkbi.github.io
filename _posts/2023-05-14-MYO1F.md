# Gene Information: MYO1F

### Genetic Position
MYO1F is located on chromosome 15q22.2 and spans approximately 219,065 base pairs of DNA.

### Pathology
MYO1F has been implicated in various human diseases including autosomal dominant deafness 28 (DFNA28) and uveal melanoma.

### Function
MYO1F encodes for an unconventional myosin protein, which is a motor protein involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, and cell adhesion.

### Related Disease
MYO1F mutations have been associated with autosomal dominant deafness 28 (DFNA28).

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for DFNA28. Hearing aids and cochlear implants are common treatment options to help manage hearing loss. However, the specific treatment and prognosis for MYO1F-related DFNA28 may vary depending on the severity of the mutation.

### Drug Response
There is no known specific drug treatment for DFNA28 or MYO1F-related diseases at present.
