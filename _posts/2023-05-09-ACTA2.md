# Gene: ACTA2
---

## Position
The ACTA2 gene is located on human chromosome 10 at position q23.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ACTA2 gene are known to cause familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). These mutations have been found to cause smooth muscle dysfunction and lead to the weakening and expansion of the aorta. 

## Function
The ACTA2 gene encodes alpha-smooth muscle actin protein, which is a major component of the contractile apparatus of smooth muscle cells. This protein is important for the generation of force during smooth muscle contraction, and it plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are numerous somatic mutations in ACTA2 reported in various cancer types. A few examples are:
- c.811G>A (p.R271Q) rs114818645
- c.729_731delTCT (p.S243del) rs1555237522
- c.506A>T (p.I169F) rs1568568755

## Related Disease
- Familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD)
- Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
TAAD is often treated with surgery to replace the weakened or expanded section of the aorta. Prognosis depends on various factors including the size and location of the aneurysm and the patient's overall health. 

## Drug Response
There is limited literature available on drug response related to ACTA2 mutations.
