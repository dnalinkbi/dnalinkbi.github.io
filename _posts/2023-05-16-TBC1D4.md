## Gene Function
TBC1D4 (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 domain family member 4) is a Rab-activating protein that plays an important role in insulin-regulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle and adipocytes. TBC1D4 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab proteins such as Rab10 and Rab14, which are involved in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. TBC1D4 is also involved in autophagy and is a substrate for Akt and AMPK, which regulate its activity.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type
There are several mutations reported in TBC1D4 that are associated with various diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. Some of the mutations reported in TBC1D4 are:
- R125W (rs35722997): Missense mutation leading to a change in the amino acid arginine to tryptophan.
- R684Q (rs16851432): Missense mutation leading to a change in the amino acid arginine to glutamine.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are several somatic mutations reported in TBC1D4 in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Some of the somatic mutations reported in TBC1D4 are:
- c.431G>T (rs747577735): Missense mutation leading to a change in the amino acid alanine to serine.
- c.1428G>A (rs3824542): Missense mutation leading to a change in the amino acid alanine to threonine.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in TBC1D4 are associated with various metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity. TBC1D4 has also been implicated in cancer as it is dysregulated in several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for mutations in TBC1D4. However, managing the underlying metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity may help improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of complications. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in TBC1D4 depends on the severity of the associated metabolic disorder or cancer.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs available that specifically target TBC1D4. However, several drugs used to treat metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity indirectly target TBC1D4 by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipocytes.
