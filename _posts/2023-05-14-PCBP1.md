### Gene: PCBP1

#### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2p15-p14

#### Pathology
- PCBP1 has been implicated in various types of cancer, including lung, breast, and gastric cancer. The downregulation of PCBP1 has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients.

#### Function
- PCBP1 encodes a protein that is involved in RNA binding and regulation of mRNA translation. It also plays a role in DNA repair and may be involved in the regulation of cell growth and tumorigenesis.
