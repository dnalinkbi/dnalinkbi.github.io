## Gene PINK1

### Information
- **Pathology:** Mutations in PINK1 have been associated with the onset of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). 
- **Function:** PINK1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the mitochondrial quality control pathway, which plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. 
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: [65018]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65018))
    - Genomic Location: [1p36.12]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000001.11?from=169341754&to=169391878&report=genbank))

### Variations
- **AA mutation list:**
    - p.Glu418*, p.Gly309Ala, p.Lys219Met, p.Asp311Gly
- **Mutation type and dbSNP ID:**
    - missense: rs61749779
    - nonsense: rs120952579
    - frameshift: rs1064795743
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

### Disease
- **Related disease:** Early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD)

### Treatment
- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no known cure for Parkinson's disease. However, some medications such as levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors may help manage symptoms.
- **Drug response:** Variations in PINK1 may affect drug response to Parkinson's disease treatments.
