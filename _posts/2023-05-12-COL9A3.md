# Information about Gene COL9A3

## Genetic Position
The COL9A3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 at position 13.3 (20q13.3).

## Pathology
The COL9A3 gene is associated with multiple disorders, including Stickler syndrome, Epiphyseal dysplasia, and Osteoarthritis.

## Function
The COL9A3 gene encodes for a type IX collagen protein, a component of the extracellular matrix in various tissues, including cartilage and intervertebral discs. It plays a crucial role in providing mechanical stability to these tissues.
