# Gene: CDK12

## Genetic Position
CDK12 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q12).

## Function
CDK12 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 12) is involved in regulating transcriptional elongation and DNA damage response. It phosphorylates RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors, which are important for the proper functioning of cells.

## Related Disease
Diseases associated with mutations in CDK12 gene are:
- Sporadic breast and ovarian cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Endometrial carcinoma
- Glioblastoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
Mutations in CDK12 gene are associated with improved response to chemotherapy and better prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.

## Drug Response
CDK12 inhibitors are currently being developed for the treatment of various cancers.
