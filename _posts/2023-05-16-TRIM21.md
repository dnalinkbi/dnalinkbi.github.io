# Gene Information: TRIM21

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11q13.2
- **Pathology:** TRIM21 is associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Function:** TRIM21 encodes for a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, involved in various cellular processes such as immune regulation, cell signaling and protein degradation. It plays a role in antibody-mediated clearance of pathogens through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and is involved in autophagy.
