## Information on Gene DCN

**Genetic Position:** 12q21.33

**Pathology:** No known major pathological conditions

**Function:** The gene DCN encodes for decorin protein which is a part of the class of small leucine rich proteoglycans. Decorin plays a role in collagen fibril formation and in the modulation of TGF-beta activity.

- HGNC: 2707
- NCBI Entrez: 1634
- Ensembl: ENSG00000111668
- OMIM: 125255
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07585
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 12: 87,229,220-87,290,606.

**Aliases:** SLRR1B, EPD, DSPG2, PG40, PG-S2, PGS2.

**AA Mutation List:**
- No pathogenic AA mutations have been identified.

**Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- rs2371336: Nonsynonymous SNV, MAF:0.0456.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified.

**Related Diseases:**
- Mutations in this gene have been associated with some congenital heart defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot and atrioventricular septal defect.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
- Treatment and prognosis may vary depending on the type and severity of the congenital heart defect.

**Drug Response:**
