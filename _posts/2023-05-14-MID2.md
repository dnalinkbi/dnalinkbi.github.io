## Gene Information

Gene: **MID2**

Aliases: FXY, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, type I, X-linked, PHA1B, PHAHB, PHB, MID2_HUMAN

Chromosome: Xq22.1-q22.2

Function: The MID2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in normal development of the brain and other organs as well as in normal skeletal muscle function.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the MID2 gene have been found to be associated with Opitz G/BBB syndrome type 1, a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body. Symptoms may include developmental delays, intellectual disability, facial abnormalities, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for Opitz G/BBB syndrome type 1, and treatment is based on the specific symptoms found in each individual. Early interventions may help to improve outcomes.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug response associated with MID2 gene mutations.
