# Information about gene CUL7

## Summary
CUL7 is a gene located on chromosome 6p21.1 that encodes a protein involved in the formation of a ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutations in this gene can lead to a range of diseases, including 3M syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms, and other skeletal abnormalities.

## Function
The CUL7 protein is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets specific proteins for degradation by the proteasome. The precise mechanisms of this process are not yet fully understood.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no known somatic mutations in CUL7.

## Related Disease
- 3M Syndrome

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no definitive treatment for 3M syndrome, but symptomatic therapy can be used to manage specific symptoms. The prognosis depends on the severity and complications of the disease.

## Drug response
There is currently no known drug response for mutations in CUL7.
