# Information on Gene B3GALT1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** B3GALT1 (Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 1) is located on chromosome 13q33.1.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the B3GALT1 gene have been associated with conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia with Joint Laxity, and Peters-plus syndrome.
- **Function for Gene:** B3GALT1 encodes for an enzyme that adds a galactose sugar to a variety of proteins, including cell adhesion molecules and proteoglycans.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels listed in the dbSNP database for B3GALT1.

## Related Disease

- **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):** This is a group of connective tissue disorders primarily affecting the skin, joints, and blood vessels. Mutations in B3GALT1 have been associated with EDS, particularly the dermatosparaxis type.
- **Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia with Joint Laxity:** This rare genetic disorder is characterized by short stature, abnormal curvature of the spine, and loose joints. Mutations in B3GALT1 are a known cause of this condition.
- **Peters-plus Syndrome:** This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, ears, and limbs. Mutations in B3GALT1 have been identified in some people with this condition.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for conditions associated with mutations in B3GALT1 are limited and focused on managing symptoms. For example, individuals with EDS may benefit from physical therapy and pain management. 
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

- There is no known drug response information available for B3GALT1.
