## Information about gene OR4A8P

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11, position 11p15.4

**Pathology:** OR4A8P is a pseudogene, meaning it is a non-functional copy of a functional gene. Pseudogenes can arise from mutations that accumulate in the functional gene, rendering it non-functional, or they can arise from the duplication of functional genes, which then accumulate mutations that render them non-functional.

**Function:** OR4A8P does not have a known function due to its pseudogene status.

**External IDs:**

- Gene ID: 100129649
- Genomic Location: NC_000011.10 (5215485..5216447)
- Aliases: OR4A8, olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily A member 8 pseudogene

**External Sites:**

- HGNC: HGNC:50162
- NCBI Entrez: 100129649
- Ensembl: ENSG00000225825
- OMIM: -
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: -

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported mutations for OR4A8P in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** OR4A8P is not known to be involved in any somatic variants in dbSNP.

**Related Disease:** OR4A8P is not known to be associated with any disease or disorder.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Because OR4A8P is a pseudogene and has no known function or disease association, there are no treatments or prognoses specifically related to this gene.

**Drug Response:** OR4A8P is not known to be involved in any drug response.

**Related Papers:**

1. No papers specifically related to OR4A8P were found in a PubMed search.

*Note: As OR4A8P is a pseudogene with no known function, gene-related information is limited and may change as new discoveries emerge.*
