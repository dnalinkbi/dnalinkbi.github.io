## Gene HBD 

**Genetic Position**: HBB (β-globin locus) on chromosome 11p15.5

**Pathology**: The HBD gene provides instructions to create the β-globin delta chain, which is a component of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body's tissues. Mutations in the HBD gene can lead to abnormal hemoglobin formation and result in blood disorders called hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. 

**Function**: The HBD gene encodes the delta-globin chain, which is a component of fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which facilitates the transfer of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetus's blood during pregnancy.

**Related Disease**: 
- Beta-thalassemia: This is an inherited blood disorder that reduces the production of functional hemoglobin. Mutations in the HBD gene can cause beta-thalassemia. Symptoms of beta-thalassemia can include anemia, fatigue, bone deformities, and delayed growth.
- Sickle cell disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that affects the shape and function of red blood cells. A specific mutation in the HBD gene can result in sickle cell disease. Symptoms of sickle cell disease can include episodes of pain, anemia, infections, and delayed growth.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment options for hemoglobinopathies such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease vary depending on the severity of the condition. Treatment can include blood transfusions, bone marrow transplant, and medication to help manage symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with hemoglobinopathies varies depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms.

**Drug Response**: Different mutations in the HBD gene can affect patient's drug response. For example, it has been shown that patients with sickle cell disease carrying a certain HBD mutation (rs334) can respond positively to hydroxyurea treatment, whereas those with a different mutation (rs334-AA) may not benefit from it.
