# Information about Gene HEATR2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 19q13.33
- **Pathology:** Not known to be associated with any pathological conditions
- **Function for gene:** Involved in cellular processes such as mRNA splicing and processing of ribosomal RNA. It is also involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival in response to DNA damage.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location
