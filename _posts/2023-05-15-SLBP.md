## Gene SLBP

The SLBP (Stem Loop Binding Protein) gene is located on chromosome 4p15.1 and encodes for a RNA-binding protein that is involved in the processing and stabilization of histone mRNAs. 

### Function 
SLBP is involved in the regulation of histone mRNA processing, translation and stability which are important for chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.
