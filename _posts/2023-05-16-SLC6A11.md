# Gene SLC6A11

## Genetic Position

The gene SLC6A11 is located on chromosome 1 (1p33-p32) and spans approximately 44,755 base pairs.

## Pathology

Mutations in the SLC6A11 gene have been associated with several psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.

## Function

The SLC6A11 gene encodes a protein known as sodium-dependent dopamine transporter (DAT1). This protein is primarily responsible for the reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron.
