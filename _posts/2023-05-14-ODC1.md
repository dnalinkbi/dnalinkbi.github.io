## **Gene information for ODC1**

ODC1 is the symbol for the gene Ornithine Decarboxylase 1. It is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2p25.1. The gene is encoded by 5 exons and spans about 13.1 kb. The function of the gene is the catalysis of the conversion of ornithine to putrescine, which is essential in the biosynthesis pathway of polyamines. The gene's aliases are DDC, ODC, and RFL6.

- R125W (rs2890652)
- H275Y (rs17140962)
- L186L (rs11545077)

### **Somatic SNVs/InDels**
The following somatic SNVs/InDels have been found in the ODC1 gene with dbSNP ID:
- rs1136410
- rs2474728

### **Related Disease**
The overexpression of ODC1 has been linked with several diseases, including:
- Cancer
- Skin diseases
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Alzheimer's disease

### **Treatment and Prognosis**
The inhibition of ODC1 can be a target for cancer treatment, as it plays a crucial role in cancer progression and tumorigenesis. Additionally, ODC1 inhibition has been shown to ameliorate storage deficits in Alzheimer's disease and prevent colitis in IBD. The prognosis of ODC1-related disease varies depending on the disease and its stage.

### **Drug response**
Several drugs targeting ODC1 inhibition have been developed for cancer treatment, including difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which has shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma.
