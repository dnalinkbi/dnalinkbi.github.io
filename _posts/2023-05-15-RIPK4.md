## Gene Information for RIPK4

RIPK4 (Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase 4) is a human gene that encodes for a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, inflammatory response, and immune signaling. It is located on human chromosome 21q22.3 and consists of 18 exons.

### Function

RIPK4 is a member of the RIPK family of protein kinases and plays a crucial role in signaling pathways that regulate epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Its function in the regulation of the epidermal development and differentiation process through the Wnt and BMP pathways has been extensively studied. Scientific evidence also suggests that RIPK4 plays a significant role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity and homeostasis in response to stress.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for RIPK4 in dbSNP.

### Related Disease

Research suggests that RIPK4 mutations can cause autosomal recessive popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by the formation of webs of the skin at the joints of the lower extremities. However, its role in other diseases is yet to be firmly established.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for PPS, although surgical intervention can help to reduce symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with PPS depends largely on the severity of the condition and the presence of associated developmental abnormalities.

### Drug Response

There are no known drugs that target RIPK4 specifically. However, as mentioned previously, surgical intervention may help to alleviate symptoms.
