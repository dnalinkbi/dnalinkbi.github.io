## Information about gene DRD5

**Genetic position and aliases**

- Chromosome: 4
- Start position: 113,545,427 bp
- End position: 113,640,776 bp
- Gene ID: 1816
- Gene name: dopamine receptor D5
- Other aliases: DRD1B, DRD1L2, D(1B), D1B dopamine receptor, D(1L), dopamine D1-like receptor, D1AR, DRD1B1

**Function of the gene**

The dopamine receptor D5 (DRD5) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily expressed in the brain. It is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes such as locomotor activity, learning and memory, and reward pathways.

- NCBI Entrez: 1816
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138685
- OMIM: 126453
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P21918

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**

- p.Ala347Ser (rs1800762)
- p.Ser494Thr (rs2234647)
- p.Thr1027Ala (rs16940791)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

There are currently no known somatic mutations in DRD5.

**Related disease**

DRD5 has been associated with various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

**Treatment and prognosis**

There are currently no approved treatments that target DRD5 specifically. However, drugs that target dopamine receptors like DRD5 are often used in the treatment of these psychiatric disorders.

**Drug response**

Individuals with certain genetic variants in DRD5 may respond differently to dopamine receptor-targeted drugs. For example, the p.Ser494Thr variant has been associated with increased response to antipsychotic drugs in patients with schizophrenia.
