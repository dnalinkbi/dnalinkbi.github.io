- Ensembl: ENSG00000148737
- OMIM: 602228
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NQB0

- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10q25.2-q25.3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- rs4506565 (p.Ser322Asn)
- rs7903146 (p.Arg1210Leu)
- rs12255372 (p.Val667Met)
- rs11196205 (p.Ile714Ser)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs/InDels were found for the TCF7L2 gene.

### Pathology and Related Diseases

- TCF7L2 gene mutations have been associated with several diseases, including:
  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
  - Glaucoma
  - Prostate cancer
  - Colorectal cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for T2DM, but treatment options include lifestyle changes, medication, and insulin therapy.
- The prognosis for T2DM patients varies based on several factors, including age, disease severity, and treatment compliance.
- Treatment options for glaucoma and cancer depend on disease stage and severity.

### Drug Response

- TCF7L2 mutations have been shown to impact response to medication in patients with T2DM. For example, carriers of the rs7903146 risk allele have been shown to have reduced response to sulfonylureas and metformin.
