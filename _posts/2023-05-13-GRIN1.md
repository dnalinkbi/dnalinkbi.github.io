# Gene GRIN1

## Information

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 9; 22,050,791 - 22,420,232 bp
- **Pathology**: Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.
- **Function**: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels involved in long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity.

## External IDs

- **Gene ID**: 2902
- **Genomic Location**: NC_000009.12 (22050791..22420232)
- **Aliases**: GRIN1, NMDA1, NDHMS
