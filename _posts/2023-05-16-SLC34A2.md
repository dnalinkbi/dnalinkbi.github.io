## Gene: SLC34A2

**Function:** The SLC34A2 gene encodes a sodium-phosphate cotransporter protein that is primarily expressed in the lung tissue. The encoded protein is involved in the process of phosphate reabsorption in the lungs.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 10999
- NCBI Entrez: 10568
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108107
- OMIM: 604217
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95436

**Genomic location:** Chromosome 4, 123,014,878-123,027,953 bp (GRCh38)

**Aliases:** NPT2B, SPDRII, NaPi-3


### Mutations:

**AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID:**

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
|p.Leu139Val |Missense        |rs104886003|
|p.Ala391Glu |Missense        |rs142225547|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for SLC34A2 in dbSNP.

### Related diseases:

Mutations in the SLC34A2 gene have been found to be associated with various lung diseases including pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF).

### Treatment and prognosis:

There is currently no cure for PAM or IPF, and treatment options are limited, often focusing on symptomatic relief. Lung transplantation may be considered for severe cases of IPF. The prognosis for patients with PAM or IPF is generally poor, with mortality rates being high.

### Drug response:

There is currently no specific drug available to treat PAM or IPF, although various approaches such as anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic drugs have been tested in clinical trials.
