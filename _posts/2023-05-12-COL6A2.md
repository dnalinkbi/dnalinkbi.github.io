## Gene: COL6A2

- Function: The COL6A2 (collagen type VI alpha 2 chain) gene encodes a component of the extracellular matrix, which plays a role in supporting and maintaining the structure of tissues and organs, particularly in connective tissues.

- Genomic location: 21q22.3

- Aliases: BMND2, CMD1B, Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy critical region protein 1, collagen alpha-2(VI) chain

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.6G>C (p.Gly2Ala) rs1220454807
    - c.5158G>A (p.Gly1720Arg) rs398122992
    - c.442G>A (p.Ala148Thr) rs142143457

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: There are no somatic SNVs/InDels in this gene.

- Related disease: Mutations in the COL6A2 gene have been found to cause various muscular dystrophies, including Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem myopathy, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B).

- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment for COL6A2-related muscular dystrophies is generally supportive, with physical therapy and mobility aids to help manage symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the specific type of muscular dystrophy and its severity.

- Drug response: There are currently no specific drugs targeting COL6A2-related muscular dystrophies, but some therapies, such as corticosteroids, have shown some benefit in improving muscle strength and function.
