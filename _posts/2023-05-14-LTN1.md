## Gene: LTN1

### Genetic Position 
The LTN1 gene is located on chromosome 2 at position 2p16.1.

### Function for gene 
The LTN1 gene encodes for the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Listerin, which is a critical regulator of protein quality control and degradation by the proteasome.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000114738
- OMIM ID: 615320
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6UB99

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Asp2112Asn (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs876660938
- p.Glu2428Lys (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs146566874

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

### Related Disease 
Mutations in the LTN1 gene have been linked to a subtype of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy known as LGMD1G (OMIM ID: 609115).

### Treatment and Prognosis 
There is currently no cure for LGMD1G, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

### Drug Response 
There is currently no targeted therapy available for LGMD1G.
