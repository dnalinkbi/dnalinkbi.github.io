# CD3E gene

## Information

- CD3E is a gene that encodes for a protein that is a subunit of the T-cell receptor complex.
- It is located on the short arm of Chromosome 11 at position 11q23.3.
- The protein encoded by CD3E is also known as T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 epsilon chain.
- The CD3E protein is expressed on the surface of T-cells and plays a vital role in T-cell activation and function.

## Function

The protein encoded by CD3E is a component of the T-cell receptor complex. It helps in transducing the activating signals generated by T-cell receptor. The CD3E protein interacts with T-cell receptor and helps in T-cell activation and proliferation. It is also involved in intracellular signaling pathways, involved in cytokine release, and in the regulation of apoptosis.

## Related diseases

CD3E gene mutations are associated with several disease conditions, including:

- Immunodeficiencies
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Eczema
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Psoriasis

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for CD3E gene mutations largely depend on the related disease and the specific mutation. Generally, treatment options involve therapies to lessen the symptoms of the disease. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the mutation and the disease.

## Drug response

There are no specific drugs available that target the CD3E gene. However, drugs that target the pathways regulated by CD3E, such as cytokines, natalizumab, or methotrexate, may be useful in treating the related diseases.
