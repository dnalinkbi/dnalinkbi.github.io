## Gene SLC35C1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosomal location: 11q21
- Cytogenetic location: 11q21
- Genomic coordinates: NC_000011.10 (54105130-54119322)

### Pathology and Function
- SLC35C1 (Solute Carrier Family 35 Member C1) gene encodes a protein that belongs to the solute carrier superfamily. This protein functions as a nucleotide sugar transporter that mediates the transport of nucleotide sugars into the Golgi lumen. 
- The encoded protein is involved in glycosylation and other post-translational modifications of proteins.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 19277
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 11315
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000184343
- OMIM ID: 604360
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NP80
- Aliases: UDP-GlcNAc transporter, Golgi-N-acetylglucosamine transporter, UGT1, UGT-related protein 1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several AA (Amino Acid) mutations associated with SLC35C1 gene such as Gly198Arg, Gln109* / 109X, Ala271Asp, and Cys260Gly mutation.
- Mutation type: missense, nonsense, and frameshift
- dbSNP ID: rs1602971121, rs777469978, rs1555076085, rs267607556

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) and InDels (Insertions and Deletions) associated with SLC35C1 gene such as rs1134880220, rs1178829536, and rs751912261.
- dbSNP ID: rs1134880220, rs1178829536, rs751912261

### Related Disease
- There are no diseases directly associated with SLC35C1 gene mutations, but abnormalities in Golgi glycosylation have been linked to a wide range of diseases such as cancer, congenital disorders of glycosylation, and neurological disorders.
