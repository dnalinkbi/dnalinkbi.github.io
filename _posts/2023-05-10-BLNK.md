# Information about gene BLNK

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 10q24.32

**Function for gene:** The BLNK gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein that plays a crucial role in B-cell development and activation. It is involved in signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of immune response.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

- HGNC:1092
- NCBI Entrez:29760
- Ensembl:ENSG00000166015
- OMIM:604515
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8WV28

Aliases:
- BASH
- BASH1
- SLP-65
- B-cell linker protein

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
No mutations in this gene are reported in COSMIC or ClinVar databases.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** 
No somatic mutations were found in the dbSNP database.

**Related disease:** The BLNK gene mutations have been associated with B-cell development and activation disorders such as agammaglobulinemia type 4 (OMIM: 613502). It is also linked with the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (OMIM: 612596).

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is no specific treatment available for BLNK gene mutations. Treatment is symptom-based and supportive care is provided. Prognosis varies depending on the type of mutation and severity of the disease.

**Drug response:** There is no targeted therapy available for BLNK gene mutations. However, immunoglobulin therapy and antibiotics may be administered.
