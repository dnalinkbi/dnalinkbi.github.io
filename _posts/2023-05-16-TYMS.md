## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations in the TYMS gene. Here are some examples: 

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|Arg125Cys |Missense|rs1801131|
|Ala200Val|Missense|rs45445694|
|Leu101Val|Missense|rs16430|

## Related Disease
There are several diseases associated with TYMS mutations, including: 
- Colorectal cancer 
- Breast cancer 
- Gastric cancer 
- Non-small cell lung cancer 

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis may vary depending on the type and severity of the disease. In some cases, TYMS inhibitors have been used in cancer treatment.

## Drug Response
TYMS inhibitors, such as 5-fluorouracil, have been found to be effective in treating certain types of cancer. However, the response to these drugs may vary depending on the patient's genetic makeup.
