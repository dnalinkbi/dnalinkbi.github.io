## Gene RDH8

### Genetic Position
- RDH8 gene is located on **chromosome 19**.
- The genomic location is **19q13.2**.

### Pathology and Function
- The function of the RDH8 gene is to encode **retinol dehydrogenase 8**, an enzyme that converts retinaldehyde to retinol during the visual cycle.
- Retinaldehyde is a key molecule in the visual reception process, and mutations in this gene can lead to impaired night vision and other vision disorders.

### External IDs 
- Gene ID: **5950**
- HGNC ID: **9957**
- Ensembl ID: **ENSG00000123358**
- OMIM ID: **608830**
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: **O75723**
- Aliases: SDR16C5, RETD8, RETDH, SDR16C5P1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.119G>A (p.Arg40His) with dbSNP ID **rs61730736**
- c.424C>T (p.Arg142Cys) with dbSNP ID **rs193166747**
- c.642C>T (p.Arg214Cys) with dbSNP ID **rs281864632**
- c.883C>T (p.Arg295Trp) with dbSNP ID **rs113474196**

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic mutations have been reported for RDH8 gene yet.

### Related Disease
- Mutations in the RDH8 gene are associated with autosomal recessive fundus albipunctatus (FA), a rare inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by the presence of white dots in the fundus and impaired rod function.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure or standard treatment for FA.
- Treatment is symptomatic, and supportive care includes bright lighting to improve vision in dim light and the use of low-vision aids to assist in reading and other daily activities.
- Prognosis varies, depending on the severity of the condition, but most individuals with this disorder have stable vision later in life.

### Drug Response
- There is no known drug treatment for RDH8 gene mutations or related diseases.
