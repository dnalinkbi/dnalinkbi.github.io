# Gene SEC23B
## Genetic Position
SEC23B is located on chromosome 20 at the position 20p11.23.

## Pathology
Mutations in SEC23B gene lead to rare autosomal recessive disorders, Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type II (CDAII). CDAII is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, jaundice, and iron overload.

## Function
SEC23B is a subunit of COPII protein complex, which is essential for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. SEC23B plays a crucial role in cargo selection, coat assembly, and membrane deformation during vesicle budding.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 10787
- NCBI Gene ID: 10484
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000101447
- OMIM ID: 609270
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q15436
- Aliases: SEC23, CDAN2

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations are reported in the SEC23B gene, leading to the pathogenesis of CDAII. Some of the common mutations with their types and dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| p.Arg24Cys | Missense | rs374980751 |
| p.Arg26* | Nonsense | rs386834384 |
| p.Cys282Tyr | Missense | rs137853001 |
| c.557-2A>G | Splice-site | rs369786930 |
| p.Asn73Thrfs*62 | Frameshift | rs397514479 |


## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in SEC23B gene are rare. However, a few of them were reported in different human cancers. Some of the common somatic mutations with their dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Cancer Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------------|----------|
| p.Ser181Phe | Melanoma | rs558843671 |
| p.Glu47Lys | Colorectal cancer | rs887553874 |
| p.Glu109Asp | Lung cancer | rs886043086 |

## Related disease
Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type II (CDAII) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SEC23B gene. The typical symptoms include jaundice, splenomegaly, and iron overload.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no definitive cure for CDAII, and the treatment mainly involves transfusion, chelation therapy, and splenectomy. Early diagnosis and proper management can improve patient outcomes.

## Drug response
The drug response of CDAII patients is not well-documented. However, some studies suggest that hydroxyurea and erythropoietin may improve the symptoms and quality of life.
