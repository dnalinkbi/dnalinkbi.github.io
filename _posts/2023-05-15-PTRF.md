## Gene PTRF

### Genetic Position
The PTRF gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the PTRF gene have been associated with a range of diseases including congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4 (CGL4), a condition characterized by severe lack of adipose tissue, muscular dystrophy, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare genetic disorder that causes premature aging.

### Function
The PTRF gene encodes a protein known as polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF). This protein plays an important role in the formation of caveolae, small invaginations of the plasma membrane that are thought to regulate numerous cellular processes such as cholesterol homeostasis, cell signaling, and nutrient uptake.
