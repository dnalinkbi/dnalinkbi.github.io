# Information about gene HS6ST1

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2q21.3

## Pathology

- HS6ST1 has been associated with multiple diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.

## Function

- HS6ST1 encodes a heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate is a component of the extracellular matrix and is involved in many signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and inflammation response.
