### **Information about gene CREB3L1**
---

#### **Genetic Position**
- The CREB3L1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q22.2.

#### **Pathology and Function for Gene**
- The CREB3L1 gene encodes for the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1, which is a transcription factor involved in the ER stress response pathway.
- This gene has been associated with various diseases, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.
- Studies have shown that CREB3L1 regulates the expression of several genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis.
