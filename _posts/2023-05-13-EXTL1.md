## Gene: EXTL1

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 8; Location: 8q24.11
- **Function:** The EXTL1 gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc and/or GlcA to the nascent heparan sulfate chains. Heparan sulfate acts as a cell surface receptor for growth factors and cytokines, and is involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 2134
    - Genomic Location: NC_000008.11:g.115388131_115458411del
    - Aliases: SLC35B2, EXTL, GLCATI, GlcAT-I
    
- **External Sites:** 
    - HGNC: 3485
    - NCBI Entrez: 2134
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000104995
    - OMIM: 608313
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q92847

- **AA Mutation List:** There are various mutations in the EXTL1 gene that have been associated with different diseases including cancers. Some of them are as follows:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Gly251Asp | Missense Mutation | rs140918092 |
| Trp260Cys | Missense Mutation | rs121909997 |
| Gly398Arg | Missense Mutation | rs797045339 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** The following somatic mutations are associated with cancer:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|-------|---------|
| c.931G>A | Missense Mutation | rs775634936 |
| c.3060G>A | Missense Mutation | rs1554484152 |
| c.3745C>T | Missense Mutation | rs67260114 |

- **Related Disease:** The EXTL1 gene has been associated with various diseases such as osteochondritis dissecans, a disorder characterized by the abnormal development of cartilage on the end of long bones in the body.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** The treatment for diseases associated with EXTL1 mutations depends on the specific disease and its severity. Treatment options may include physical therapy, medication, or surgery. 

- **Drug Response:** Currently, there is no information available on drug response for EXTL1 mutations.
