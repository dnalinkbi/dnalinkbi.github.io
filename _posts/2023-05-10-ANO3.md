## Gene ANO3
### Information
- Gene: ANO3
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11, Position 68.71 - 68.98 Mb
- Aliases: TMEM16C, DOG1c
- Function: ANO3 encodes a protein that belongs to the TMEM16 family of proteins. It is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission and movement control.
- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 17783
    - NCBI Entrez: 55107
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000175405
    - OMIM: 610604
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NQ90
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.1229C>T, p.(Arg410Cys), rs149902470
    - c.1309T>C, p.(Ile437Thr), rs150416784
    - c.1613G>A, p.(Ala538Thr), rs387906786
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported
- Related disease: ANO3 mutations have been linked to various disorders related to movement control such as dystonia, chorea, and tremor.
- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment of ANO3-related movement disorders involves mainly symptomatic treatment such as anticholinergics, botulinum toxin injections, and deep brain stimulation. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of other underlying factors. 
- Drug response: The current data on drug response related to ANO3 mutations are limited due to the rarity of the condition and the lack of large-scale studies.
