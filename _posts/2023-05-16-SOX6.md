## Gene: SOX6 

### Genomic Position
The gene SOX6 is located on chromosome 11q23.3, from base pair 116356757 to base pair 116376789.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SOX6 gene have been associated with certain diseases like Coffin-Siris syndrome. Additionally, altered expression levels of SOX6 have been observed in different pathologies including cancers and developmental disorders.

### Function for Gene
The SOX6 gene encodes for a transcription factor that plays an important role in embryonic development, chondrogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. It acts as a suppressor of chondrocyte hypertrophy and is also involved in cartilage formation.

### Related Disease
- Coffin-Siris syndrome: Autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features. SOX6 mutations have been identified in some patients with this syndrome.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of Coffin-Siris syndrome is based on individual symptoms and can include physical therapy, speech therapy, and medication for seizures and anxiety. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the presence of co-occurring conditions.

### Drug Response
There is limited information regarding drug response specific to SOX6 mutations at this time.
