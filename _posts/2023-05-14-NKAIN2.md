## Gene NKAIN2

### Genetic Position
The NKAIN2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 at position 22.31. 

### Pathology and Function
The NKAIN2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that has been shown to play a critical role in synaptic function and plasticity in the brain. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various neurological conditions including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability.
