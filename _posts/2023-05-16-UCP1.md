# Gene UCP1 Information

## Genetic Position
- Gene: UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1)
- Chromosome: 4q22.1
- Genomic Coordinates:  102,194,668-102,196,303
- Transcript: NM_021833.4

## Function
- UCP1 encodes a mitochondrial protein that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis, generating heat instead of ATP in brown adipose tissue. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy expenditure and thermogenesis.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 12523
- NCBI Entrez: 7350
- Ensembl: ENSG00000122487
- OMIM: 113730
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P25874

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.226G>A, p.Arg75Gln (rs1800592)
- c.247C>T, p.Pro83Leu (rs45583533)
- c.601G>A, p.Arg201Gln (rs45576216)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.211G>A, p.Arg71His (rs3729847)
- c.799C>T, p.Pro267Ser (rs377729510)

## Related Disease
- Obesity
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Metabolic Disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis
- UCP1 gene therapy is a promising treatment for obesity and metabolic disorders. However, further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of this approach.

## Drug Response
- Some drugs, including beta-adrenergic agonists and thyroid hormones, can upregulate UCP1 expression and promote thermogenesis.
