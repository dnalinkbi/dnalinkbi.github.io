# Information about Gene MIR934

## Genetic Position
Gene MIR934 is a microRNA gene located on chromosome 11q23.3.

## Pathology and Function
MIR934 is a non-coding RNA gene that produces a small RNA molecule called microRNA-934. MicroRNAs are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and MIR934 is predicted to regulate the expression of several genes related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the specific functions of MIR934 are not well understood.
