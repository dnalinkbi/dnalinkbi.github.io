# Gene: RABGGTA 

## Genetic Position
RABGGTA (RAB geranylgeranyltransferase alpha subunit) is located on Chromosome 2q22.1 in humans.

## Pathology and Function 
The RABGGTA gene codes for a protein that plays an essential role in protein geranylgeranylation, a process where lipid moieties are attached to proteins to target them to specific cellular membranes. RABGGTA is also responsible for the attachment of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to proteins, a step that is necessary for the prenylation of some RAB proteins. Mutations in this gene can lead to several diseases such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, which is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.

Not available.

## Related Disease
- Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure or specific treatment for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by RABGGTA mutations. Treatment is usually symptomatic, aiming to manage the complications such as respiratory failure, dysphagia, and joint contractures. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that specifically targets RABGGTA mutations.
