# Information about gene PDHB

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
- Gene Name: PDHB (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 Beta Subunit)
- Gene Location: Chromosome 3p14.3
- Pathology: Mutations in PDHB gene can cause Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 Deficiency 
- Function: PDHB encodes for a protein subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which plays a key role in cellular energy metabolism by converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 8777
- NCBI Entrez ID: 5162
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163914
- OMIM ID: 179060
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P11177
- Aliases: PDCB, PDHE1-B

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- A list of all amino acid mutations and their corresponding mutation types can be found in dbSNP.
- Example: p.Arg236Cys (missense mutation) - rs80338615

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- A list of somatic SNVs/InDels for PDHB can be found in dbSNP.
- Example: c.1039A>G (missense mutation) - rs55952209

## Related Disease
- Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 Deficiency is the main disease associated with mutations in PDHB gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 Deficiency involves a low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, as well as the use of thiamine or dichloroacetate.
- The prognosis for patients with this disease varies depending on the severity of their condition.

## Drug Response
- Some studies have shown that dichloroacetate can improve the symptoms of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 Deficiency by increasing the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
