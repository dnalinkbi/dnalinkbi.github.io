## ILK Gene Information

### Genetic Position
The ILK (Integrin-linked kinase) gene is located on chromosome 11q13.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the ILK gene have been linked to several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and muscular dystrophy.

### Function
The ILK gene codes for a protein that is involved in cell adhesion and signaling. It plays a key role in integrin-mediated signaling and is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and survival.

### Related Disease
Abnormalities in ILK expression and activity have been associated with numerous diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and muscular dystrophy.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no approved drugs that target the ILK protein. However, pre-clinical studies have shown promising results, suggesting that targeting the ILK pathway may have therapeutic potential in certain diseases.

### Drug Response
ILK has been shown to modulate the response to certain chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that it may be possible to enhance drug efficacy by targeting this pathway.
