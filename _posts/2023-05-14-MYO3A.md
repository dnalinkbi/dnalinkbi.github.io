# Information about Gene MYO3A

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 10
- Start: 75,512,607
- End: 75,767,190
- Strand: Plus

### Pathology
MYO3A gene is associated with hearing loss. Variants in this gene cause autosomal recessive hearing loss (ARHL).

### Function
MYO3A gene encodes myosin IIIA protein. This protein is involved in the actin-based processes of hair cells in the inner ear. MYO3A is essential for the maintenance of stereocilia bundles and is linked to the transduction of auditory signals.

### External IDs

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Cys703Tyr (rs80338972)
- p.Arg725Trp (rs80338973)
- p.Asp1233Tyr (rs200972971)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported yet.

### Related Disease
- Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL)

### Treatment and Prognosis
For the treatment of MYO3A-associated hearing loss, hearing aids and cochlear implants are commonly used. The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of hearing loss.

### Drug Response
The use of drugs for MYO3A-associated hearing loss has not been reported yet.
