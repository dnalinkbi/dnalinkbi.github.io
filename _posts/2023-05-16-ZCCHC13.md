# Gene ZCCHC13

## Genetic Position
ZCCHC13 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 at position 21.12.

## Pathology and Function
The ZCCHC13 gene encodes a zinc finger CCHC domain-containing protein 13 which is involved in various biological processes including RNA metabolism, translation regulation, and DNA damage response. The exact function of ZCCHC13 is not yet fully understood, but studies have suggested that this gene plays a role in spermatogenesis and cancer development.
