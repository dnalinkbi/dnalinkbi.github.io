## Gene Information Analysis: ASAH1

### Genetic Position
ASAH1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8p22), with a length of approximately 39 kb.

### Pathology
ASAH1 is the gene that encodes acid ceramidase, which is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide into sphingosine and a free fatty acid. The accumulation of ceramide leads to pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer.

### Function
Acid ceramidase plays a role in the metabolism of sphingolipids and the regulation of cellular apoptosis. Specifically, it hydrolyzes ceramide to produce sphingosine and a free fatty acid, which are important signaling molecules in various physiological processes, including the cell cycle, differentiation, and death.

- p.Arg366Cys (rs121908102)
- p.Thr113Ile (rs796001990)
- p.Asp46Glu (rs267608310)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations of ASAH1 reported in dbSNP, including:
- rs1554949424
- rs1182033974
- rs1554949425

### Related Disease
ASAH1 mutations have been associated with Farber disease, a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of ceramides in various tissues. Symptoms include joint pain, swelling, hoarseness, and granulomas on the skin.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Farber disease, and treatment is symptomatic. Pain relief and anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to manage joint pain and swelling. Enzyme replacement therapy is also being investigated as a potential treatment.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available regarding drug response and ASAH1 mutations.
