## Information about gene PGAM1

### Genetic Position
PGAM1 is located on chromosome 10 (10q25.2) and spans 15,535 base pairs.

### Pathology
PGAM1 has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders.

### Function
PGAM1 encodes for phosphoglycerate mutase 1, which is an enzyme that plays a role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. This enzyme converts 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate and helps to generate ATP.
