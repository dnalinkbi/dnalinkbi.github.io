# Gene SOD3

**Genetic position:** The SOD3 gene is located on chromosome 4q21.3.

**Pathology:** Mutations on the SOD3 gene have been associated with various pathologies such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.

**Function for Gene:** The SOD3 gene encodes for superoxide dismutase 3, an enzyme that converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. This process helps to neutralize free radicals within cells.
