## Information on Gene NT5C3A

### Genetic Position
The gene NT5C3A is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q22.1) and spans over 120 kb in length.

### Pathology
Mutations in the NT5C3A gene have been associated with a variety of cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer.

### Function for Gene
The NT5C3A gene encodes the protein 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IIIA, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates and plays a key role in purine metabolism.
