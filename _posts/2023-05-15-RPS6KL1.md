## Information about gene RPS6KL1

### Genetic Position
The RPS6KL1 gene is located on the chromosomal band 22q12.1 and spans approximately 300 kilobases.

### Pathology 
RPS6KL1 is thought to play a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and mutations in this gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.

### Function
The RPS6KL1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in multiple signaling pathways and may play a role in the regulation of cell survival. It is also involved in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, which is important in cancer biology.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no annotated missense mutations in RPS6KL1 in the dbSNP database. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations have been reported in RPS6KL1 in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer. These include missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and splice site mutations. Notably, a recurrent frameshift mutation at position c.2678 has been identified in both lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer. These somatic mutations do not have dbSNP IDs but can be found in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database.

### Related Disease
RPS6KL1 has been found to be dysregulated in various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer. Dysregulation of this gene has been associated with oncogenesis with an unknown mechanism. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment targeting RPS6KL1. The prognostic significance of RPS6KL1 in cancer is still being studied. 

### Drug response
There is currently no information on specific drug response between RPS6KL1 and cancer treatment.
