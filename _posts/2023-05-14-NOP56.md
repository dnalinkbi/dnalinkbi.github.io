## Gene Information: NOP56

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 20
- Genomic Coordinates: 20q11.21
- Genomic Location: 33,490,390-33,505,994

### Pathology
The NOP56 gene is known to be associated with various diseases and disorders such as:

- Autosomal recessive form of osteopetrosis type 7

### Function 
The NOP56 gene encodes for a protein that is a component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex. This complex plays an important role in the biogenesis of ribosome subunits through post-transcriptional modifications of ribosomal RNA.
