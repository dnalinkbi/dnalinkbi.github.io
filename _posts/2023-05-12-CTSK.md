## Gene Information for CTSK

### Gene Function
- CTSK (Cathepsin K) gene encodes for a protein that belongs to the peptidase C1 family and plays a role in bone resorption. It cleaves type I collagen to facilitate bone remodeling and is expressed in osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption.

### External IDs and Genomic Location for the Gene
- Gene ID: 1513
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1 (NC_000001.11) with location from base pair 213,756,808 to base pair 213,760,809.
- Aliases: PYCD, CTSO

### Related Disease
- CTSK mutations are associated with pycnodysostosis, a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by short stature, osteosclerosis, and bone fragility.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for pycnodysostosis are supportive and include management of fractures and dental problems. Gene therapy is a potential future option but is still in the preclinical stage.

### Drug Response
- Cathepsin K inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases, but their clinical efficacy and safety profiles are still being evaluated.
