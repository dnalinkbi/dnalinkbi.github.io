## Gene PSIP1

PSIP1 is a gene that encodes a protein known as lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75), which plays a role in various cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling.

### Function

The protein encoded by PSIP1 serves as a transcriptional co-activator, which means that it binds to certain transcription factors and enhances their ability to activate gene expression. Additionally, the protein is involved in the process of HIV-1 integration into the host cell genome, which is a critical step in the pathogenesis of AIDS. 

### External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC: 9547
- NCBI Entrez: 11168
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116791
- OMIM: 603100
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y4B6

Aliases for PSIP1 include dJ857M17.1, DFS70 autoantigen, IBD10, PC4 and SFRS1 interacting protein 1, and p75. 

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no reported disease-causing mutations in PSIP1 gene according to the ClinVar database.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations in the PSIP1 gene detected in different cancer types, according to the COSMIC database. However, none of these mutations have been assigned a dbSNP ID.

### Related Disease

PSIP1 has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and autoimmunity. However, the exact role of the gene in these diseases is not fully understood.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Since PSIP1 has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS and cancer, it is a potential target for drug development. However, more research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of targeting PSIP1.

### Drug Response

There is currently no information on drug response related to PSIP1.
