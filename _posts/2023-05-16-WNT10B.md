# Information about Gene WNT10B

## Genetic Position

The gene WNT10B is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13.12).

## Pathology

Mutations in the WNT10B gene have been associated with various diseases including ectodermal dysplasia with abnormal tooth morphology, odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia, and  split-hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency. 

## Function

The WNT10B gene encodes a member of the WNT family of signaling proteins. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. WNT10B specifically plays a role in the development of hair follicles and sweat glands, as well as bone formation.
