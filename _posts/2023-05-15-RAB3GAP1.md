## Information about gene RAB3GAP1

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 2 (2q21.3)

**Pathology**: RAB3GAP1 mutations have been associated with Warburg Micro syndrome type 1 (WARBM1) and Martsolf syndrome (MRTS).

**Function**: RAB3GAP1 encodes a protein that is involved in Rab GTPase activation, which is crucial for numerous cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, exocytosis, and endocytosis.

**External IDs and Aliases**: 
- Gene ID: 80223
- HGNC ID: 21550
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000169732
- OMIM ID: 602536
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q969V5
- Aliases: RAB3GAP, KIAA0819

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 
- p.Arg841Gln (missense) - rs587776775
- p.Pro531Leu (missense) - rs778099790
- p.Asp121Gly (missense) - rs267607168

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
No somatic mutations have been reported for RAB3GAP1 in COSMIC database.

**Related Diseases**:
- Warburg Micro syndrome type 1 (WARBM1)
- Martsolf syndrome (MRTS)

**Treatment and Prognosis**:
Currently, there is no cure for Warburg Micro syndrome type 1 (WARBM1) and Martsolf syndrome (MRTS). Treatment is generally supportive and aims to manage symptoms.

**Drug Response**: 
No information is available about drug response for RAB3GAP1 mutations.
