## Information about gene NCOR2

### Genetic Position

The NCOR2 gene (Nuclear receptor corepressor 2) is located on the long arm of chromosome 12. It spans 1,024,979 base pairs and is located at position 12q24.31.

### Pathology

Mutations in the NCOR2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 

### Function

The NCOR2 gene encodes a protein called nuclear receptor corepressor 2, which plays a role in gene regulation. Specifically, it acts as a transcriptional corepressor by binding to nuclear receptors and inhibiting their activity. It also interacts with other proteins involved in gene regulation, such as histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases.
