# Gene ANKS6

## Information

ANKS6 is a gene located on chromosome 9 (9q22.31) and encodes for a protein called ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 6. This gene is associated with various diseases and disorders.

### Function

The ANKS6 protein is involved in the formation of protein complexes, which play a role in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, development, and differentiation.
