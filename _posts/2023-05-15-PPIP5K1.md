# Gene Information

## Gene: PPIP5K1

### Pathology
According to the NCBI gene database, PPIP5K1 is associated with non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive, 71.

### Function
PPIP5K1 gene encodes a protein called diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase 1 (DIPP1), which is a member of the inositol phosphate family. DIPP1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of both 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5-PP-InsP5) and 1-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (1-PP-InsP5), which play an important role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways and neurotransmitter release.

### Related Disease
As mentioned earlier, the PPIP5K1 gene is associated with non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive, 71.

### Treatment and Prognosis
At the moment, there is no specific treatment available for PPIP5K1-related deafness. However, there are some treatment options available for hearing loss, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and bone-anchored hearing aids. The prognosis of PPIP5K1-related hearing loss largely depends on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on the drug response associated with PPIP5K1 mutations.
