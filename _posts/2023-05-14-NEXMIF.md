# Information about Gene NEXMIF

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome Xq22.1
- **Function for Gene:** NEXMIF encodes a protein called neurite extension and migration factor inducing protein which is involved in long-range neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex.
- **External IDs for Gene:** 
    - **HGNC:** 28532
    - **NCBI Entrez:** 644254
    - **Ensembl:** ENSG00000147475
    - **OMIM:** 300986
    - **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q96EH1
- **Aliases:** C11orf82, KIAA2022, NEXMIF01, RP11-251B1.3
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

   No pathogenic variations were reported in literature or ClinVar for Nexmif protein.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

   No somatic variations were reported in literature or ClinVar for Nexmif protein.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in NEXMIF are associated with X-linked intellectual disability. 
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** No specific treatment or cure was reported for NEXMIF associated disorders. Prognosis depends on the severity of intellectual disability and presence of co-morbid conditions.
- **Drug Response:** No specific drugs are available for NEXMIF associated disorders.
