# Gene ERCC3

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2: 141,754,709-141,894,007

**Pathology:** Mutations in ERCC3 gene have been linked to Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB) and Cockayne Syndrome (CS), which are rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, sunburn, skin cancer, neurological abnormalities, and premature aging.

**Function for Gene:** The ERCC3 gene encodes a helicase that is a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH. This helicase is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA, which is critical for maintaining genome stability. It unwinds double-stranded DNA at the site of DNA damage, allowing other repair factors to remove the damaged nucleotides and replace them with the correct ones.

- c.431A>T (rs372253607)
- c.1946A>G (rs757390131)

**Related Diseases:** Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB) and Cockayne Syndrome (CS)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no known cure for XPB or CS. Treatment usually involves avoiding exposure to UV light and regular monitoring for skin cancer. Prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms and the promptness of diagnosis.

**Drug Response:** There is limited information available on drug response for ERCC3 mutations. However, studies have suggested that platinum-based chemotherapy may be less effective in tumors with ERCC3 mutations.
