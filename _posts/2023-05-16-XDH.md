# Information about Gene XDH

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function
- **Gene Name:** Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH)
- **Genetic Position:** 2p22.1
- **Pathology and Function:** XDH is an enzyme that plays a key role in purine metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Deficiency of XDH activity results in xanthinuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by high levels of xanthine in the blood and urine.

## External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:12824
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 7498
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000128191
- **OMIM ID:** 607633
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P47989
- **Aliases:** XOR, BDPL, DURS2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No pathogenic coding variants in XDH gene has been associated with Mendelian diseases.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic variants with dbSNP ID have been reported in the XDH gene.

## Related Disease
- Xanthinuria

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Allopurinol has been successfully used as a treatment for xanthinuria, decreasing the production of uric acid and xanthine in the body.

## Drug Response
- Allopurinol has been shown to be effective in the treatment of xanthinuria by reducing uric acid and xanthine production.
