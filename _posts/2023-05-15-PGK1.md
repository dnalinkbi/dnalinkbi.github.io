# Gene: PGK1

## Gene information
- Gene function: PGK1 encodes for the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase that is involved in the glycolytic pathway and cellular energy production.

## Genetic variations
- AA mutation list:  Missense mutations in PGK1 have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called PGK1 deficiency. Some of the mutations reported in literature include:
   - c.280G>A (p.Arg94His) - rs74315269
   - c.775G>A (p.Gly259Ser) - rs786204345
- Mutation type: Missense mutations
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: None reported in literature

## Related disease
- PGK1 deficiency: A rare genetic disorder that presents with hemolytic anemia, myopathy, and neurological symptoms.

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment options for PGK1 deficiency are limited and primarily focus on management of symptoms. Blood transfusions and folate supplementation may be necessary to manage anemia.
- The prognosis for PGK1 deficiency can vary depending on the severity of symptoms and age at diagnosis. Some patients may experience a significant reduction in symptoms with treatment, while others may experience life-threatening complications.
