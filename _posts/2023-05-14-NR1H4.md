# Information about Gene NR1H4

## Genetic Position

Gene NR1H4 is located on the chromosome 12 at position 33.3.

## Pathology

NR1H4 is implicated in several diseases including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), and Cholestasis. Mutations in NR1H4 can also lead to Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC).

## Function

NR1H4 is a nuclear receptor that regulates bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. It plays a significant role in the regulation of bile acid synthesis, secretion, and circulation.

## External IDs and Aliases

- External Gene ID: HGNC:7971
- Genomic Location: NC_000012.12:g.9746147G>A
- Aliases: FXR, HRR-1, BAR, RIP14

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA mutations reported in NR1H4. Some of them include:

- p. Ala312Thr (rs35768389) - Missense
- p. Asn99Ser (rs140565759) - Missense
- p. Cys130Tyr (rs140565769) - Missense

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in NR1H4. Some of them include:

- c.488T>C (rs150153062) - Missense
- c.524C>T (rs35185567) - Missense
- c.883G>A (rs34110986) - Missense

## Related Disease

NR1H4 is associated with several diseases, some of which include:
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)
- Cholestasis
- Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment available for mutations in NR1H4. However, management of the associated diseases like IBD and FH can help to improve the prognosis.

## Drug Response

There are drugs that modulate the activity of NR1H4. It has been shown that bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine can activate NR1H4 function.
