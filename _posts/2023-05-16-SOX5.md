## Gene SOX5

- Function: The SOX5 gene encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of proteins. It is involved in the regulation of embryonic development, cell fate determination, and differentiation of various tissues, including the nervous, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems.
