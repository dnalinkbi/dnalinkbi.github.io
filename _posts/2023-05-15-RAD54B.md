# Information about Gene RAD54B

## Genetic Position
Gene: RAD54B

Chromosome: 2

Location: 2q31.1

## Pathology
RAD54B is associated with susceptibility to breast cancer and is involved in DNA repair, recombination, and replication.

## Function
RAD54B contains a DNA-dependent ATPase activity and is an essential component of the homologous recombination pathway involved in repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. It also plays a key role in the restart of stalled DNA replication forks.
