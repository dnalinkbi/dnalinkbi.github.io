# Gene Information
**Gene Name:** SMAD2  
**Aliases:** MADH2, MADR2  
**Chromosome:** 18  
**Genomic Location:** 18q21.1  
**External IDs:**  
- HGNC: 6779  
- NCBI Entrez: 4087  
- Ensembl: ENSG00000175387  
- OMIM: 601366  
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15796  

# Gene Function
SMAD2 is a member of the SMAD family of transcription factors, which play a crucial role in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This pathway regulates a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SMAD2 is involved in transmitting signals from the TGF-β receptor to the nucleus, where it can activate or repress target genes.
