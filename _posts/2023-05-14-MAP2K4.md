## Gene: MAP2K4 

### Genomic Position and Pathology
- The human MAP2K4 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2.
- Mutations in this gene have been linked to various cancers, including pancreatic, colorectal, and breast cancer.

### Function
- The MAP2K4 gene encodes a protein called dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4).
- MAP2K4 is involved in regulating cellular responses to stress and inflammation pathways, and it plays a role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
