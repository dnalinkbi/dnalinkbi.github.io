### Gene PMEL

PMEL gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13.1). The gene encodes for a protein called Melanocyte protein PMEL, also known as gp100. GP100 is a key component in the process of melanin synthesis and melanosome formation in melanocytes.

**Function of PMEL gene:**

The PMEL gene encodes for a protein called gp100 which is critical for melanin production and its transfer into melanosomes. PMEL also acts as a chaperone for the efficient maturation and transport of tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin synthesis.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

The PMEL gene has somatic mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (InDels). Some of these mutations are listed below:

|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-------------|--------|
|Missense mutation|rs139052551|
|Missense mutation|rs74969164|

**Related Diseases:**

Mutations in PMEL gene have been associated with various types of melanoma, including cutaneous malignant melanoma, uveal melanoma, and mucosal melanoma. Mutations in the PMEL gene are also associated with progressive hearing loss.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

The treatment and prognosis for melanoma depend on multiple factors, including the stage of the disease, age, and overall health of the patient. Treatment options for melanoma include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Recent studies suggest that immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors may be effective in treating certain types of melanoma.

**Drug response:**

There is limited information available about drug response related to mutations in PMEL gene. However, some studies have suggested that individuals with certain mutations in PMEL may be less responsive to certain immunotherapies used to treat melanoma.
