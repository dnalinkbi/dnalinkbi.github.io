# Information about Gene DAZ2
## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: Y
- Location: Yq11.222

## Pathology 
- The DAZ2 gene is associated with male infertility. 

## Function
- DAZ2 is a member of the DAZ gene family and it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis.

## Gene and Genomic Location ID and Aliases
- Gene ID: 57008
- Genomic Location: NC_000024.10
- Aliases: DAZL2, DAZ4, SPGY4

## External IDs
- HGNC: 27216
- NCBI Entrez: 57008
- Ensembl: ENSG00000183878
- OMIM: 415000
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IYX8

## AA Mutation and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No AA mutation found in DAZ2 with dbSNP ID.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No SNVs/InDels found in DAZ2 with dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease 
- Male infertility

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options depend on the type and severity of infertility. 
- Since this gene is only expressed in males, and it is not a very critical gene, there are not specific treatments based on repairing this gene.

## Drug Response
- No information available regarding drug response and DAZ2 gene.
