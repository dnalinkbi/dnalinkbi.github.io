## Gene KCNJ10

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 1, bands q23.2-q23.3  
**Aliases:** Kir4.1, Kcnj13  
**Function:** The KCNJ10 gene encodes for a potassium ion channel protein known as Kir4.1. This channel plays a critical role in maintaining the resting membrane potential of glial cells in the central nervous system.

**Mutation type:** Missense, Nonsense, and Missense-Near-Splice  
**Somatic SNVs/InDels**
None reported.

**Related disease:** 
Mutations in KCNJ10 gene have been associated with SeSAME syndrome (Seizures, Sensorineural deafness, Ataxia, Intellectual disability, and Electrolyte imbalance) and EAST/SeSAME-like syndrome (EASME = Epilepsy, Ataxia, Sensorineural deafness, Migraine, and Arrhythmia). 

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment is symptomatic and supportive emphasizing the need to manage seizures. The prognosis depends on the severity of the neurological features. 

**Drug response:** No specific drugs have been developed for KCNJ10 mutations as yet.
