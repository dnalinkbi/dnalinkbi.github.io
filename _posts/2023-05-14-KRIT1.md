## Information for gene KRIT1

### Genetic Position

KRIT1, also known as CCM1, is located on chromosome 7q11.2-q21.2.

### Pathology

KRIT1 is associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), a vascular disorder that causes abnormal blood vessels to form in the brain and affects approximately 1 in 5,000 people. Mutations in KRIT1 are responsible for about 40% of familial cases of CCM.

### Function

KRIT1 contains multiple protein interaction domains and is involved in various signaling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways. It is thought to play a role in cardiovascular development and stabilization of the endothelial barrier.

### Somantic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several SNVs associated with KRIT1, including:

- rs9331896
- rs77286823
- rs753929391

### Related Disease

KRIT1 mutations can cause cerebral cavernous malformations, which are characterized by abnormal blood vessels in the brain and recurrent hemorrhages.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for cerebral cavernous malformations. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms such as headaches and seizures, and monitoring for further hemorrhages. The prognosis for individuals with CCM can vary depending on the severity of the condition.

### Drug Response

There is currently no specific drug approved for the treatment of cerebral cavernous malformations.
