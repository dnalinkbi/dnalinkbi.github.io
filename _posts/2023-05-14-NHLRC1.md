## Gene: NHLRC1

### Information on Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 16
- Location: 16p11.2
- Strand: Plus
- Other Names: EPM2B, EPM2B1


### Pathology and Function
- The NHLRC1 gene is associated with a rare form of epilepsy called Lafora disease.
- It is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism in the brain.
- Mutations in the NHLRC1 gene lead to the accumulation of abnormal glycogen aggregates called Lafora bodies in neurons, which causes neurodegeneration and seizure activity.

### Related Disease
- Lafora disease, a rare inherited form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.


### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for Lafora disease.
- Treatment focuses on controlling seizure activity with anti-epileptic drugs and addressing symptoms such as muscle spasms and ataxia using physical therapy and other supportive measures.
- Prognosis for patients with Lafora disease is poor, with most patients experiencing degenerative cognitive decline and eventually succumbing to the disease.


### Drug Response
- A number of drugs have been evaluated for their potential to treat Lafora disease, including valproic acid and mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus.
