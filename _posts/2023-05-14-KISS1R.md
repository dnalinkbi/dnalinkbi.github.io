# Gene KISS1R

## Information
- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 19 (19p13.3)
- **Pathology**: Mutations in KISS1R have been associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, delayed puberty, and infertility. Abnormal KISS1R expression has also been linked to cancer and metabolic disorders.
- **Function**: KISS1R encodes a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of puberty and reproduction by regulating the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.
- **Aliases**: GPR54, AXOR12, hOT7T175
- **External IDs**:
    - HGNC: 22446
    - NCBI Entrez: 84634
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000122584
    - OMIM: 604161
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q969F8

- Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment of KISS1R-related disorders often involves hormone replacement therapy to compensate for the decreased levels of sex hormones. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the age at which treatment is initiated.

## Drug response

There is currently no FDA-approved drug for the treatment of KISS1R-related disorders. However, the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs has been reported to improve reproductive function in some patients with KISS1R mutations.
