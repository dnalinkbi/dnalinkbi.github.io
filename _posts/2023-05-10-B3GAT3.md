## Gene: B3GAT3

### Genetic Position
B3GAT3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q12.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the B3GAT3 gene can lead to severe developmental disorders such as Peters-plus syndrome (PPS) and Sheldon-Hall syndrome (SHS). 

### Function
The B3GAT3 gene encodes for an enzyme called beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 3, which is involved in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are important components for the structure and function of various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and skin.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for B3GAT3.

### Related Disease
Mutations in B3GAT3 are associated with Peters-plus syndrome (PPS) and Sheldon-Hall syndrome (SHS). PPS is a rare disorder characterized by eye abnormalities, short stature, and other developmental defects. SHS is a genetic disorder that affects several parts of the body, causing multiple joint contractures and weaknesses.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for PPS or SHS, and the treatment is usually symptomatic. Early diagnosis and management of symptoms can improve the quality of life of affected individuals.

### Drug response
There is no known drug response for mutations in B3GAT3.
