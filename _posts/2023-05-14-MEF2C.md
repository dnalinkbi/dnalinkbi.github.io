## Information about Gene MEF2C

### Genetic Position

The MEF2C gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5q14.3).

### Pathology

Mutations in the MEF2C gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, autistic features, and language impairment. These mutations can be inherited or arise spontaneously.

### Function

The MEF2C gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in brain development, including the differentiation and migration of neurons, synapse formation, and plasticity.

### External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC: 6999
- NCBI Entrez: 4208
- Ensembl: ENSG00000141510
- OMIM: 600527
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q06413

Aliases: MADS box transcription enhancer factor 2, polypeptide C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C), MEF2C-B, MEF2C-A.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- p.Arg324Cys (rs387906830)
- p.Arg324His (rs767613363)
- p.Arg324Leu (rs387906831)
- p.Arg324Ser (rs387906832)
- p.Arg324Trp (rs387906833)

All these mutations are missense mutations, meaning that a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid in the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the MEF2C gene in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma. However, no dbSNP IDs are available for these mutations.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the MEF2C gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including:

- Severe intellectual disability with stereotypic movements, epilepsy, and/or cerebral malformations (OMIM #613406)
- Rett syndrome, atypical, with seizures (OMIM #613454)
- Autism spectrum disorder, susceptibility to, 20 (OMIM #617261)
- Schizophrenia (OMIM #181500)

### Treatment and Prognosis

Individuals with mutations in the MEF2C gene require personalized treatment based on their specific symptoms and severity of the disorder. There is currently no cure for MEF2C-related disorders, and treatment options are primarily supportive.

### Drug Response

There is limited information available regarding the drug response of individuals with mutations in the MEF2C gene.
