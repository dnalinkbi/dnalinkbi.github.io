# Information about gene MIR184

## Genetics
- Gene name: MIR184
- Location in genome: Chromosome 15q25.1
- Alias: miR-184, has-mir-184, MIRN184, miRNA184

## Function
- MIR184 is a microRNA gene that codes for a small RNA molecule involved in gene regulation. It has been shown to play a role in the development and function of the cornea and lens in the eye.

## External IDs
- HGNC: HGNC:31440
- NCBI Entrez: 406989
- Ensembl: ENSG00000272511
- OMIM: 613146
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: n/a

## AA mutations
- No missense mutations have been reported in MIR184

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No somatic mutations have been reported in MIR184

## Related disease
- Mutations or dysregulation of MIR184 has been associated with familial keratoconus, a degenerative eye disease that affects the cornea.

## Treatment and prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for mutations or dysregulation of MIR184. Treatment of keratoconus usually involves corrective lenses and surgical options like corneal transplantation.
- Prognosis for keratoconus can vary depending on the severity of the disease and the individualâ€™s response to treatment.

## Drug response
- No specific drugs have been identified for the treatment of MIR184-related keratoconus.
