# Gene IDO1

## Genetic Position
IDO1 gene is located on chromosome 8q24.1.

## Pathology
IDO1 is associated with the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. Changes in IDO1 expression have been implicated in the progression of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.

## Function
IDO1 is an enzyme involved in the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine, thereby regulating the availability of tryptophan and producing kynurenine pathway metabolites. This pathway plays a crucial role in modulating various physiological processes, including immunity and inflammation.
