# Information about Gene CLEC3B

##  Genetic Position
Gene: C-type lectin domain family 3 member B (CLEC3B) is located on Chromosome 20q13.13.

## Pathology and Function
CLEC3B is associated with bone metabolism and coagulation and has been identified in osteoblasts and platelets. This gene also encodes a glycoprotein involved in the regulation of bone mineralization and osteoblast differentiation. Additionally, CLEC3B plays a role in the regulation of thrombus formation. Studies have indicated that CLEC3B is upregulated in various cancers including breast and lung cancer, indicating its potential role in tumor progression.
