# Gene GNB5

### Gene Information
The GNB5 gene is located on chromosome 15 at the location 15q21.2. It is also known by its aliases G-protein subunit beta-5 and guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-5. The gene produces a protein consisting of 359 amino acids.

### Function
The protein encoded by GNB5 gene is a member of the beta subunit family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which are involved in transmitting signals from outside the cell to inside the cell. It plays a role in regulating calcium channels and may also play a role in spermatogenesis.

### Genetic Mutations
- AA Mutation List: A list of all the amino acid mutations in the GNB5 gene can be found on the dbSNP ID: [rs374555968]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs374555968).)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: There are currently no known somatic mutations in the GNB5 gene.


### Related Diseases
Some variants in the GNB5 gene have been associated with several genetic diseases, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), Graves' disease, and cardiovascular diseases. These variants can lead to changes in the function of the encoded protein, resulting in improper signaling within cells.


### Treatment and Prognosis
While there is no known cure for genetic diseases caused by GNB5 gene variants, there are several treatments currently available to manage symptoms. Treatment options may include medication to regulate blood pressure or hormone levels, or surgery to address complications from certain diseases.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the GNB5 gene. However, drugs that target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which interact with G proteins, may indirectly affect the function of the GNB5 gene.
