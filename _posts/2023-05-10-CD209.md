# Information about Gene CD209

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

- **Genetic Position:** CD209 is located on chromosome 19q13.42.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in CD209 are associated with increased susceptibility to infections caused by certain pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV-1.
- **Function:** CD209 encodes for a transmembrane protein known as DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) that is mainly expressed on the surface of immune cells, particularly dendritic cells. DC-SIGN plays a crucial role in the recognition and binding of pathogens, facilitating their uptake and presentation to other immune cells for subsequent elimination.

## Gene Information

- **Function:** Pathogen recognition receptor, involved in innate immunity.
- **External IDs:** HGNC:17068, NCBI Entrez:30835, Ensembl:ENSG00000171867, OMIM:604651, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q9NNX6.
- **Aliases:** DC-SIGN, CD209 antigen.

## Variation Information

- **AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

| Mutation Type | AA Mutation | dbSNP ID |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Missense      | V11D        | rs10841637 |
| Missense      | A21T        | rs11465309 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Currently, no somatic mutations have been reported for CD209 in cancer.

## Associated Diseases

- Mutations in CD209 have been associated with increased susceptibility to infections caused by certain pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV-1.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- The treatment and prognosis associated with CD209 mutations are not well defined.

## Drug Response

- Currently, there is no information available regarding drug response associated with CD209 mutations.
