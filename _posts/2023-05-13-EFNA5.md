# Information about Gene EFNA5

## Genetic Position
- Entrez Gene: 1942
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 5 (5q21.2)

## Pathology
EFNA5 plays a role in the development of the nervous system, and mutations or dysregulation of this gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia.

## Function
EFNA5 encodes a protein called ephrin-A5, which belongs to the ephrin family of proteins. These proteins bind to ephrin receptors, and their interactions regulate various cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation.
