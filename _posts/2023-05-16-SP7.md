### Related Disease

SP7 gene is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, a connective tissue disorder characterized by fragile bones and susceptibility to fractures.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known cure for osteogenesis imperfecta. Treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms and reducing the risk of fractures. In severe cases, bone marrow transplant can be done. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response

There is no known drug specifically developed for osteogenesis imperfecta. However, bisphosphonates and teriparatide are sometimes used to increase bone density and reduce the risk of fractures.
