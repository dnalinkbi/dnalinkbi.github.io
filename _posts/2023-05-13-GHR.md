# Gene GHR

**Genetic Position:** 5p13-p12

**Pathology:** GHR gene mutations have been associated with altered growth hormone (GH) signaling and several conditions such as Laron syndrome, GH insensitivity, and idiopathic short stature.

**Function for Gene:** Encodes the growth hormone receptor, which is a transmembrane protein that binds to circulating GH. The binding of GH to its receptor activates the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, leading to several downstream cellular responses such as growth, metabolism, and immune system regulation.

**Aliases:** GHBP, GH receptor isoform 2, GH receptor type 2, GH receptor type III, GHR-II, GHR-III, Laron syndrome growth hormone receptor, Serum binding protein

- p.Gly120Arg - Missense Variant - dbSNP: rs121912954
- p.Arg43Gln - Missense Variant - dbSNP: rs121912953

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.930-44_930-43insG - InDel - dbSNP: rs1553073604
- c.975+121G>A - SNV - dbSNP: rs1553073699

**Related Diseases:** 
- Laron syndrome (LS)
- Growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS)
- Idiopathic short stature (ISS)

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
Treatments for GHIS and ISS include GH replacement therapy and growth-promoting medications, respectively. LS individuals are resistant to GH treatment, and no effective treatment is currently available.

**Drug Response:**
GHIS patients have shown significant improvement with GH treatment, while LS individuals have not shown any response.
