## Gene PPP3R1
PPP3R1 gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 3 (PP2B) that plays a crucial role in the transduction of Ca2+ signals in various cell types. The protein regulates Ca2+-dependent activation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), involved in the immune response. 

### Gene Function
The protein encoded by PPP3R1 gene binds to the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 3, a major protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, transcription, and cell cycle. PPP3R1 acts as a mediator between calcium signaling pathways and the downstream cellular effects of NFAT.

### Related Disease
PPP3R1 mutations have been linked to immune disorders such as Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for immune disorders associated with PPP3R1 mutation requires further research. Current treatments for patients with immune disorders focus on immunosuppressive drugs that help alleviate autoimmune symptoms. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity and onset of autoimmune disease.

### Drug Response
No drug response data available for PPP3R1 mutations.
