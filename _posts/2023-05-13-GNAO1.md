### Gene information

**Gene:** GNAO1 (G protein subunit alpha O1)

**Function for gene:** The protein encoded by GNAO1 gene is a member of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which functions as a transducer of signaling pathways in cells. It is involved in signal transduction cascades mediated by ligand-activated GPCRs, including dopamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, and adrenergic receptors. 

**Genomic location:** Chromosome 16q12.2

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

- HGNC: 4395
- NCBI Entrez: 2776
- Ensembl: ENSG00000103191
- OMIM: 139311
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09471

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
There are several amino acid mutations reported in the GNAO1 gene. Some of them are:

|Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|---------|------|----------|
|p.Arg209Gln| Missense   | rs756689970|
|p.Arg209Leu| Missense   | rs796065599|
|p.Arg209Cys| Missense   | rs768497052|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Not available

**Related disease:** Mutations in the GNAO1 gene have been associated with multiple neurological disorders, including:

- Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 17 (OMIM: 615473)

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific neurological disorder diagnosed, severity, and frequency of the symptoms. As GNAO1 mutations are rare, there are no specific treatments. Management of seizures and developmental delay can be provided by antiepileptic drugs and early intervention programs.

**Drug response:** Not available
