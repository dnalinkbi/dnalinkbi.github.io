# Information about gene STK39

- **Genetic position**: STK39, also known as Serine/threonine-protein kinase 39, is located on chromosome 2q24.3.

- **Pathology**: STK39 has been found to be associated with hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.

- **Function for gene**: STK39 encodes the serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK1) which is a serine/threonine kinase. SGK1 is involved in the regulation of sodium transport in the kidney and is a key mediator for aldosterone signaling.

    - Ensembl: ENSG00000144320
    - OMIM: 605740
    - NCBI Entrez: 27347
    - Alias: SGK1

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** None reported

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

- **Related disease:** Hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases varies depending on the severity of the condition, however lifestyle changes such as exercise, healthy diet, and weight management are often recommended. In some cases, medication (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) may also be prescribed.

- **Drug response:** Individuals with certain genotypes of STK39/SGK1 have been found to respond differently to certain antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.
