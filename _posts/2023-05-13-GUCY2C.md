# Gene Information

## Gene Name: GUCY2C
GUCY2C is a gene that encodes a protein called guanylyl cyclase 2C. 

## Pathology
Mutations in GUCY2C have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer.

## Function
The GUCY2C gene is expressed in the intestine and regulates fluid and ion movement in the gut. It is involved in the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), which plays a critical role in modulating signaling pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and death.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in GUCY2C have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for colorectal cancer associated with GUCY2C mutations. Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Prognosis depends on the stage and severity of the cancer.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no known drugs that specifically target GUCY2C mutations associated with colorectal cancer.
