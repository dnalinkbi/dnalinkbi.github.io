# Information about Gene GPR98

## Gene position 
The gene GPR98 is located on chromosome 5q14.3.

## Pathology 
Mutations in GPR98 have been associated with several disorders, including Usher syndrome type 2C, nonsyndromic hearing loss, and retinitis pigmentosa.

## Function
GPR98 codes for a protein known as G protein-coupled receptor 98. This protein plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of sensory cells in the inner ear and retina. It is also involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and adhesion processes.
