## Gene: CHM

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: Xq21.2
- Start position: 87,500,550 bp
- End position: 87,549,385 bp

### Pathology
- Mutations in CHM gene can lead to Choroideremia, a genetic disorder which causes progressive vision loss due to degeneration of the choroid and retina.

### Function
- The CHM gene encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP1). This protein is involved in the prenylation of Rab proteins, which are critical for vesicle trafficking and signaling.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 1972
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 1121
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000076349
- OMIM ID: 303100
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P24386
- Aliases: CHM1, REP-1

### AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID
- c.822-4A>G, splice site, rs397514687
- c.1057C>T, missense, p.Arg353Cys, rs80358256
- c.949G>A, missense, p.Ala317Thr, rs80358255
- c.253C>T, missense, p.Arg85Cys, rs104894754

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- None reported

### Related Disease
- Choroideremia (OMIM #303100)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for choroideremia, but there are therapies to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Gene therapy is promising and is being studied in clinical trials.
- Prognosis is variable, but most individuals with choroideremia will eventually experience severe vision loss.

### Drug Response
- None reported
