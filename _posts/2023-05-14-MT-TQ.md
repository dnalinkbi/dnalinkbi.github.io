## Gene MT-TQ

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** MT-TQ is located on the mitochondrial DNA molecule on the heavy strand at position 4712.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in this gene have been associated with mitochondrial diseases.
- **Function:** The MT-TQ gene encodes for transfer RNA (tRNA) which is responsible for carrying the amino acid tryptophan to the ribosome during protein synthesis.

### Gene Identification

- **External IDs:** HGNC: 7485; NCBI Entrez: 4550; Ensembl: ENSG00000210082; OMIM: 590045; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16445.
- **Aliases:** TRW, Leu-UUR.

### Mutations

- **AA Mutation List:** The most common variation in this gene is the single-base substitution m.4728G>A. Other less common mutations include: m.4716C>T, m.4721T>C, and m.4715A>G.
- **Mutation Type:** These mutations are point mutations.
- **dbSNP ID:** rs28666096 (m.4728G>A).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

- **dbSNP ID:** There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in this gene according to dbSNP.

### Related Disease

- **Disease:** Mutations in the MT-TQ gene are associated with mitochondrial diseases such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).
- **Symptoms:** LHON is characterized by acute loss of central vision primarily in young adult males. Other symptoms include optic atrophy, color blindness, and peripheral vision loss.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment:** There is no cure for LHON, however, some treatments have been developed to improve visual function in affected individuals. These treatments include idebenone and gene therapy.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis for LHON patients ultimately depends on the severity of the symptoms. Some individuals may experience spontaneous recovery, while others may suffer from permanent vision loss.

### Drug Response

- **Drug Response:** Idebenone has been shown to improve visual function in some individuals with LHON, although the response rate varies among patients.
