## Gene KIT

**Function for gene:**

The KIT gene encodes for a transmembrane receptor protein called the tyrosine-protein kinase kit, which is a part of the cytokine receptor family. This receptor plays a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It binds to a ligand known as the stem cell factor (SCF) or KIT ligand and activates downstream signaling pathways via phosphorylation. The KIT protein is expressed in various cells, including hematopoietic stem cells, melanocytes, mast cells, and germ cells.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

Some common mutations in the KIT gene are:

|AA change|Mutation type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|------------|-------|
|D816V   |Missense    |rs121913529|
|D816H   |Missense    |rs121913530|
|D816Y   |Missense    |rs121913531|
|D820Y   |Missense    |rs14129    |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) reported in the KIT gene which are associated with various cancers. Some of these variants and their dbSNP IDs are:

- c.2446A>G (p.Asn816Asp) - rs121913529
- c.2447G>A (p.Asn816Asp) - rs121913529
- c.2393G>A (p.Val798Met) - rs55737532
- c.2461C>T (p.Leu821Phe) - rs148374937

**Related disease:**

Mutations in the KIT gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and melanoma. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with disorders such as piebaldism, which is a rare genetic disorder affecting skin and hair pigmentation.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

For GISTs, treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy with drugs like imatinib and sunitinib, which inhibit the kinase activity of the KIT protein. AML patients with KIT mutations often have poor prognosis and resistance to standard chemotherapy. However, recent studies suggest that KIT inhibitors like midostaurin and gilteritinib may improve the outcomes in these patients. Treatment for melanoma with KIT mutations also includes targeted therapy with drugs like imatinib and dasatinib.

**Drug response:**

As mentioned earlier, drugs like imatinib and sunitinib are used to treat GISTs and melanoma that have KIT mutations. A study has also shown that patients with AML having KIT mutations may respond to KIT inhibitors, such as midostaurin and gilteritinib.
