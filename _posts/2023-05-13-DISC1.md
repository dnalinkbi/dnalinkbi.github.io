# Gene: DISC1

**Function for gene:** DISC1 (Disrupted in schizophrenia 1) gene is involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function. It plays a role in intracellular signaling, neuronal migration, and axonal transport.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

- Gene ID: 27185 
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1: 208,749,204-209,405,166 
- Aliases: SCPD1, C1orf136

- HGNC: 4954 
- NCBI Entrez: 27185 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137648 
- OMIM: 605210 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NRI5

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 

- c.2295G>A (rs821577) p.Gly765Ser 
- c.亳亳亳G>T (rs亳亳亳) p.亳亳亳 
- c.亳亳亳T>C (rs亳亳亳) p.亳亳亳 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- No somatic mutations/variants are reported.

**Related disease:**

Disrupted DISC1 has been linked to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

There is no specific treatment for DISC1-related disorders. However, antipsychotic medication can help alleviate some symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Prognosis depends on the specific disorder and the severity of the patient's symptoms.

**Drug response:**

There is limited data available on drug response related to DISC1.
