# Gene: NSD2

## Genetic Position

NSD2 or Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 2, also known as MMSET (multiple myeloma SET), is located on chromosome 4q24, spanning about 587 kb and having 24 exons.

## Pathology

NSD2 plays a crucial role in normal hematopoiesis and is frequently dysregulated in hematologic malignancies. It is the target of the recurrent t(4;14)(p16;q32) translocation seen in multiple myeloma and is also commonly overexpressed or mutated in lymphomas and leukemias.

## Function for Gene

NSD2 encodes a histone methyltransferase that primarily targets lysine 36 of histone H3. It is involved in transcriptional activation and silencing, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Studies have shown that NSD2 targeting therapies could be a promising treatment for hematologic malignancies, especially multiple myeloma. It is associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes and survival rates in lymphoma and leukemia patients.

## Drug Response

NSD2 inhibitors including MI-503, JIB-04, and PF-06952229 have been shown to have anti-myeloma activities. They have been shown to be effective against NSD2-driven resistant cancer cells.
