# Gene HSF4

## Genetic Position
The gene HSF4 is located on chromosome 16q21 and spans a genomic region from position 57,022,603 to 57,089,521.

## Pathology
Mutations in the HSF4 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant cataracts. These cataracts can be congenital or develop in early childhood and are characterized by the opacity of the lens, leading to a decrease in visual acuity.

## Function
HSF4 encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the heat shock factor (HSF) family. This protein functions as a transcriptional regulator and plays a role in the response to cellular stress, particularly high temperature and oxidative stress. HSF4 is also involved in the development and maintenance of the lens in the eye.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for HSF4.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HSF4 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant cataracts.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of cataracts caused by HSF4 mutations is based on surgical removal of the cloudy lens followed by implantation of an artificial lens. The prognosis after cataract surgery is generally favorable, but long-term follow-up is needed to monitor for potential complications.

## Drug Response
No specific drug response information is available for cataracts caused by HSF4 mutations.
