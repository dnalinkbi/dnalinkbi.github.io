# Information about gene ATRX

## Genetic Position
The ATRX gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xq21.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ATRX gene are associated with several genetic disorders, including alpha-thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability (ATR-X) syndrome, intellectual disability with or without alpha-thalassemia (ATR-X syndrome without alpha-thalassemia), and other neurodevelopmental disorders. 

## Function
The ATRX gene encodes a protein that is involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. It is thought to play a role in maintaining the structure of chromatin during DNA replication and repair.

## Related disease
- Alpha-thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability (ATR-X) syndrome
- Intellectual disability with or without alpha-thalassemia (ATR-X syndrome without alpha-thalassemia)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for ATR-X syndrome or other disorders associated with mutations in the ATRX gene. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, such as epilepsy, scoliosis, and developmental delays.

## Drug response
There is currently no specific drug therapy available for ATR-X syndrome.
