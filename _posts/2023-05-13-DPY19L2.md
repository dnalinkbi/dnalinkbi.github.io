# Gene: DPY19L2

## General Information
DPY19L2 is a gene that is located on the short arm of chromosome 12. It has a genomic location of 12p11.21. The gene is also known by its aliases SPGF8 and C12orf15.

## Function
The DPY19L2 gene is involved in the development and maintenance of spermatozoa. It produces a protein called dpy-19-like protein 2, which is localized to the nuclear envelope of spermatids and is involved in the formation of spermatid acrosome and the fusion of the acrosome to the sperm head.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DPY19L2 gene that have been identified. One of the most common is rs724078, which is a missense mutation resulting in an amino acid change from serine to leucine at position 736 of the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information on somatic mutations in the DPY19L2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the DPY19L2 gene have been associated with male infertility, specifically globozoospermia. Globozoospermia is a rare condition characterized by the absence of a sperm acrosome and is a cause of severe male factor infertility.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for globozoospermia caused by DPY19L2 mutations. Treatment options are limited to assisted reproduction techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which can bypass the need for an acrosome. The prognosis for individuals with DPY19L2-related globozoospermia is generally poor, as the condition often leads to infertility.

## Drug Response
There is no information on drug response specifically related to DPY19L2 mutations.
