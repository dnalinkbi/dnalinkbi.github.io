# Gene Information for CYP4F3

## Genetic Position
The CYP4F3 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

## Pathology and Function of Gene
The CYP4F3 gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of a wide range of substrates, including drugs and endogenous compounds. CYP4F3 is involved in the metabolism of leukotriene B4, which is a potent inflammatory mediator. Mutations in this gene have been associated with an increased risk of asthma and other inflammatory diseases.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations or single nucleotide variations (SNVs) have been reported for CYP4F3.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CYP4F3 have been associated with an increased risk of asthma and other inflammatory diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for asthma and other inflammatory diseases vary depending on the severity of the condition and individual patient factors. Prognosis can be good with proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Drug Response
CYP4F3 plays a role in the metabolism of leukotriene B4, which is a target for several drugs used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
