## Gene PAK2

- Function: PAK2 (p21-activated kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, proliferation, and survival.
- External IDs and Aliases: 
    - HGNC: 8619
    - NCBI Entrez: 5062
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000104936
    - OMIM: 603050
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O96013
    - Aliases: PAK65
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    - C40R (rs115575587), S60R, A120S, L143P (rs202172591), and L411V (rs200336466) are known missense mutations in PAK2.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: 
    - No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported yet for PAK2 in dbSNP database.
- Related disease: 
    - PAK2 has been found to be associated with several diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and autism.
- Treatment and prognosis: 
    - Since PAK2 is involved in various cellular functions, it has been targeted for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. However, there is no specific treatment available for PAK2-related diseases yet, and further research is needed in this area.
- Drug response: 
    - Some studies have shown that PAK2 inhibitors such as PF-3758309 and FRAX597 may have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment by inhibiting the growth and survival of cancer cells.
