# Gene GFM1

## Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 3 (NC_000003.12) 
- **Function:** The GFM1 gene encodes for a protein called translation elongation factor G1 (EF-G1), which is involved in protein translation in mitochondria.
- **External IDs & Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: 4177
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 85476 
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000144834 
    - OMIM ID: 606113
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O95754 
    - Alias: EFG1, TSFM, MTIF2
    
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 

    - c.424G>A (p.Arg142His) rs147348435
    - c.727C>T (p.Arg243Ter) rs773644216
    - c.1109G>A (p.Cys370Tyr) rs121434434
    - c.1262A>G (p.Asn421Ser) rs542137587
    - c.1339T>C (p.Ile447Thr) rs139102539
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

    There are no known somatic mutations reported for the GFM1 gene.
    
- **Related diseases:** 

    Mutations in the GFM1 gene have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6), which is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects brain development.
    
- **Treatment and prognosis:**

    At present, there is no cure for PCH6 caused by GFM1 mutations. Treatment is symptomatic and focuses on managing the symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease. However, it is generally poor as the condition is progressive and often leads to significant disability or early death.
    
- **Drug response:**

    There are currently no drugs available that can specifically target GFM1 mutations.
