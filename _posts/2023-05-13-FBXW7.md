# Gene FBXW7

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** The FBXW7 gene is located on chromosome 4 (4q31.3) in humans.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in this gene have been associated with various types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer.

- **Function:** The FBXW7 gene encodes for a protein called F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7). FBXW7 is a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the cell cycle by targeting various proteins for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway.

    - c.1279C>T (rs398122203)
    - c.1161_1162insCACG (rs886041811)
    - c.422G>A (rs1057518954)

- **Related Disease:** Some of the diseases associated with mutations in the FBXW7 gene include:

  - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  - Endometrial cancer
  - Colorectal cancer

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options for individuals with FBXW7-associated cancers depend on the type and stage of cancer. Prognosis also varies depending on several factors such as the size and location of the tumor, the extent of metastasis, and the individual's overall health.

- **Drug Response:** There is limited information on drug response specific to FBXW7-associated cancers. However, some studies have suggested that FBXW7 loss-of-function mutations may confer sensitivity to certain drugs such as cisplatin and epirubicin.
