# Gene KRT5

## Information

- Genetic position: Chromosome 12q13.13
- Pathology: Mutations in this gene cause several autosomal dominant disorders, including epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) and Dowling-Degos disease. 
- Function: Codes for the KRT5 protein, a member of the keratin family, which forms intermediate filaments in epithelial cells.
