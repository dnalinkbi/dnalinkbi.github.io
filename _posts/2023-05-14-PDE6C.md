# Information About Gene PDE6C

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 10
- Location: 10q24.32

## Pathology
- Mutations in PDE6C are associated with retinitis pigmentosa type 49 (RP49), a rare genetic disorder of the retina that causes vision loss and blindness.

## Function
- PDE6C encodes the alpha subunit of phosphodiesterase 6, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the visual cycle in photoreceptor cells.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 5147
- HGNC ID: 8784
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000138167
- OMIM ID: 600827
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q13956
- Aliases: PDEA5, RP49

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.1265G>A (p.Gly422Arg) rs61751317
- c.151A>G (p.Asp51Gly) rs61751318
- c.1004A>G (p.Thr335Ala) rs61751319

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations have been reported in PDE6C.

## Related Disease
- Retinitis pigmentosa type 49 (RP49)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for RP49, but there are some treatments that can help slow down the progression of vision loss.
- Prognosis is variable and ultimately depends on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information on drug response for PDE6C mutations.
