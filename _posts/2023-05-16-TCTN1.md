# Gene Information Analysis Report: Gene TCTN1

## Genetic Position
- Gene Name: Tectonic family member 1 (TCTN1)
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12q24.33
- Strand: minus
- Locus Type: protein-coding gene

## Pathology and Function
- Function: The TCTN1 gene encodes a protein component of the tectonic protein complex, which plays important roles in intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis. This gene is also involved in the regulation of Hedgehog signaling pathway.

## Instructions
- To analyze the genetic information of a gene, begin by identifying its gene name, chromosome, location, strand, and locus type.
- Determine the function of the gene and any external IDs and aliases associated with it.
- Research external sites such as HGNC, NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, OMIM, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot for further information on the gene, including related diseases, treatment options, and drug responses.
- Check for AA mutations and somatic SNVs/InDels with their respective dbSNP IDs.
- Provide links to related papers and articles, citing the author and DOI.
