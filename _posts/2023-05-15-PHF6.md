# Information about Gene PHF6

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

### Genetic Position
- Gene: PHF6
- Chromosome Location: Xq26.2
- Genomic location: NC_000023.11 (90460613..90524391)

### Pathology and Function
- PHF6 gene encodes a protein called PHD finger protein 6.
- It is involved in the regulation of gene transcription and chromatin remodeling.
- Mutations in the PHF6 gene have been associated with various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Loss of PHF6 function has been found to contribute to the development and progression of these cancers.
