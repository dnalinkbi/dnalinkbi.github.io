## Somatic mutations

There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels for ODAM in dbSNP.

## Related diseases

Mutations in the ODAM gene have been associated with amelogenesis imperfecta, a rare genetic disorder that affects the formation of tooth enamel.

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for amelogenesis imperfecta typically involves dental rehabilitation, which can include dental implants, orthodontics, and restorative treatments. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug response

There is currently no information on drug response related to mutations in the ODAM gene.
