## Gene: POLG2

### Function:
The POLG2 gene encodes the DNA polymerase gamma 2 subunit, which is an important component in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication machinery.

### External IDs:
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17, q24.2-q25.1
- HGNC ID: 9173
- NCBI Entrez ID: 11232
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000131341
- OMIM ID: 608541
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O95167

### AA mutation list:
- p.Arg116Cys
- p.Ile118Met
- p.Thr251Ile
- p.Ala467Thr

### Mutation type and dbSNP ID:

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
None reported.

### Related diseases:
- Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (ARPEO)
- Myopathy, mitochondrial progressive, with congenital cataract and developmental delay (MPCCD)
- Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 15 (MTDPS15)
- Sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO)
- Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 15 (MTDPS15)

### Treatment and prognosis:
There is no cure for mitochondrial diseases caused by POLG2 mutations. Treatment is usually supportive and aimed at managing symptoms, which can include vision and hearing loss, weakness, fatigue and difficulty swallowing. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease, but these disorders can be life-threatening.

### Drug response:
There is no known drug therapy for mitochondrial diseases caused by POLG2 mutations.
