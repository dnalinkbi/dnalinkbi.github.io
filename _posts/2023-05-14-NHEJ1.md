**Gene:** NHEJ1 (Non-Homologous End Joining Factor 1)

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1q31.3

**Aliases:** Cernunnos, XLF, NHEJ1 antibody, SCID4

### Function for gene
NHEJ1 gene provides instructions for making a component of a DNA repair complex. This complex is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by a process known as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is a major pathway responsible for repairing potentially lethal DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, free radicals, and reactive chemicals.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported in the NHEJ1 gene. Some of them are:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Leu128Pro | Missense | rs374783920 |
| p.Glu298Asp | Missense | rs146323722 |
| p.Arg206Cys | Missense | rs74850607 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the NHEJ1 gene yet.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the NHEJ1 gene are associated with a severe combined immunodeficiency disorder known as SCID-4. This disease is characterized by an impaired immune system, leaving affected individuals prone to recurrent and life-threatening infections which do not respond to treatment.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options for SCID-4 include bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. The prognosis largely depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and treated.

### Drug Response
Information on drug response is not available yet.
