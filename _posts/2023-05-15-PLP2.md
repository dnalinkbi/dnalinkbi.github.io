# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene PLP2

## Gene Information

- **Gene:** PLP2
- **Aliases:** PLP1, DM20, PLPC1, DM-20, DM20S
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome Xq22.2

## Pathology and Function

- **Function of Gene:** PLP2 encodes a transmembrane protein that is essential for the formation and maintenance of myelin sheaths in the nervous system.

## External IDs

- **HGNC:** 9064
- **NCBI Entrez:** 5351
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000130829
- **OMIM:** 300401
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P60201

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- rs143909356: c.470C>T (p.Arg157Ter)
- rs121918062: c.468G>A (p.Gly156Arg)
- rs267607162: c.469A>C (p.Gln157Pro)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for PLP2 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the PLP2 gene are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD), a rare inherited disorder of the central nervous system that affects the development and maintenance of myelin sheaths.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for PMD, but treatment is generally supportive and focused on managing symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with PMD varies depending on the severity and extent of the neurological damage.

## Drug Response

There are currently no known drug treatments specifically targeted to PLP2 mutations or PMD.
