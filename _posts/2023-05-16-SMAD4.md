# Information about gene SMAD4

## Genetic Position
The SMAD4 gene is located on chromosome 18 at the position 18q21.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SMAD4 gene have been linked to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) type 2 and juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS).

## Function
SMAD4 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a central role in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

- c.1229G>A (rs786203518)

## Related Disease
- Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
- Juvenile polyposis syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with SMAD4-related HHT are often treated with medications to control symptoms. Those with juvenile polyposis syndrome may need surgery to remove polyps in the colon. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the specific mutations involved.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response for SMAD4-related diseases.
