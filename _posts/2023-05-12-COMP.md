# Gene COMP

## Genetic Position
The gene COMP is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in the COMP gene have been linked to several disorders, including pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. These conditions are characterized by abnormalities in bone growth and development.

## Function
The COMP gene encodes for a protein called cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, which is involved in the formation and maintenance of cartilage in the body. This protein also plays a role in bone development and repair.
