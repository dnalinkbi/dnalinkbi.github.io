# Gene GPI

## Information

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 2q14.3
- **Pathology**: Mutations in GPI gene cause a deficiency of GPI-anchor synthesis resulting in a condition known as multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 2 (MCAHS2), a rare autosomal recessive disorder.
- **Function**: The GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor is a glycolipid that extends outward from the cell surface and anchors many proteins, including acetylcholinesterase and decay accelerating factor. The GPI anchor facilitates attachment of these proteins to the external surface of the plasma membrane and can function as a signal for lipid rafts or sorting and signal transduction.

## External IDs and aliases

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for GPI gene.

## Related Disease

- Multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 2 (MCAHS2)

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for MCAHS2 and treatments are mainly supportive, aimed at managing seizures, and improving developmental progress. Prognosis for individuals with MCAHS2 can vary widely depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug response

There are currently no known drugs that specifically target GPI gene mutations associated with MCAHS2.
