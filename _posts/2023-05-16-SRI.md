# Gene SRI

## Genetic Position
The gene SRI is located on chromosome 14q21.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SRI gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

## Function
The SRI gene encodes for the protein sorcin, which plays a role in calcium binding and homeostasis, as well as regulation of ion channels and apoptosis. Sorcin has also been shown to be involved in resistance to chemotherapy.
