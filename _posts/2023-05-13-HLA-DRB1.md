# Information about gene HLA-DRB1

## General Information
- **External IDs:** HGNC:4948, NCBI Entrez: 3123, Ensembl: ENSG00000196126, OMIM: 142857, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04229
- **Aliases:** HLA-DRB, HLA-DR1B, DRB1, DRB1-201, DRB1*01:01, DR1B1, DR1B201, MHC class II antigen DRB1, DRB1*0101
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 6p21.3

## Function
The HLA-DRB1 gene encodes for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR Î²-chain protein, which is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule. This molecule is involved in presenting antigens to CD4+ T cells, which play a critical role in the adaptive immune response.

## AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID and Mutation Type
- rs9271366: p.Asp57Asn (missense)
- rs660895: p.Tyr26Tyr (synonymous)
- rs2187668: p.Leu11Leu (synonymous)
- rs9271640: p.Ala71Ala (synonymous)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs and InDels in the HLA-DRB1 gene that have been identified, but there isn't any dbSNP ID available for them.

## Related Disease
Variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene have been linked to a number of autoimmune diseases, including:
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Multiple sclerosis
- Type 1 diabetes

## Treatment and Prognosis
There isn't any direct treatment for variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene, but therapies targeting the immune system have been used to manage autoimmune diseases associated with the gene. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and disease severity.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that specific variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene may affect drug response to certain medications, such as methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.
