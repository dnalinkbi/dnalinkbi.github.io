## Information on Gene SMARCA4

SMARCA4 is a gene located on chromosomal position 19p13.2. It codes for a protein called SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 4. This protein belongs to the SWI/SNF family of proteins involved in DNA remodeling, which is essential for gene expression regulation, cell differentiation, and proliferation.

### Function for gene
The SMARCA4 gene encodes the SMARCA4 protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modifying the chromatin structure. It does so by remodeling nucleosomes and altering the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. The alteration in chromatin structure could also regulate DNA repair and replication.

### Related disease
Several diseases are associated with mutations in the SMARCA4 gene such as:
- Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS)
- SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcoma
- Neuroblastoma
- Non-small cell lung cancer

### Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for SMARCA4-related diseases depend on the specific condition and stage of the disease. Patients with SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomas are typically treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with surgery reserved for certain cases. There are currently no targeted therapies available for SMARCA4-related diseases, and prognosis remains poor.

### Drug response
There are currently no approved drugs that target SMARCA4. However, a few preclinical studies have suggested that some drugs may sensitize SMARCA4-deficient cancer cells to chemotherapy, including PARP inhibitors and gemcitabine.
