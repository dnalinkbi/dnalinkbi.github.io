## Information about gene ABCA1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 9:107,227,782-107,400,402

**Pathology:** ABCA1 gene mutations have been associated with Tangier disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by low levels of HDL cholesterol, and increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

**Function:** The ABCA1 gene encodes a protein that transports cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells to keep them from accumulating in tissues and causing damage. It also plays a role in the formation of HDL particles.

**External IDs and Aliases:**

* HGNC: HGNC:29
* NCBI Entrez: 19
* Ensembl: ENSG00000165029
* OMIM: 600046
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95477



**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

* p.Phe1072Cys (rs2066714) - Missense
* p.Leu949Val (rs2230806) - Missense
* p.Gln1211Arg (rs2230808) - Missense
* p.Arg1587Cys (rs2230809) - Missense


**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID have been reported for ABCA1 gene.

**Related Disease:** Tangier disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for Tangier disease. However, treatment focuses on managing the symptoms associated with the disease. The prognosis for Tangier disease can vary based on the severity of the disease and individual factors.

**Drug Response:** No drug response has been reported for ABCA1 gene.
