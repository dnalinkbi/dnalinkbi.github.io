# Information on Gene SLC6A19

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

### Genetic Position

The gene SLC6A19 is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 5 at position 15.2 (5q15.2).

### Pathology

Mutations in SLC6A19 gene lead to the loss of function of B^0AT1 protein which is encoded by this gene. This affects kidney and intestine, causing the amino acid transport defect in these organs. This defect results in reduced absorption of neutral amino acids, leading to Hartnup disease (HD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by aminoaciduria, skin rash in sun-exposed areas and neurological symptoms.

### Function

The SLC6A19 gene encodes a protein known as the neutral amino acid transporter B^0AT1, which is responsible for facilitating the absorption of neutral amino acids in the body. It is primarily expressed in the kidney and small intestine and plays an important role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis, particularly the reabsorption of filtered neutral amino acids in the proximal tubule of the kidney.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations that have been reported in the SLC6A19 gene. Some of the notable ones include:

- c.775G>A (p.Gly259Ser) - rs137852689
- c.1271G>A (p.Gly424Arg) - rs137852688
- c.1403A>C (p.Leu468Phe) - rs137852687

These mutations are either missense variants where a single nucleotide change leads to a change in the amino acid sequence or nonsense variants that result in the formation of a premature stop codon.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic mutations reported in the SLC6A19 gene.

### Related Diseases

SLC6A19 mutations are associated with Hartnup disease and tryptophanuria.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment of Hartnup disease primarily involves the management of symptoms. This includes maintaining a diet high in tryptophan and avoiding sunlight exposure which can exacerbate skin manifestations. Most patients with Hartnup disease experience a normal lifespan and are able to live relatively normal lives.

### Drug Response

There is no known pharmacogenomic information reported for the SLC6A19 gene.
