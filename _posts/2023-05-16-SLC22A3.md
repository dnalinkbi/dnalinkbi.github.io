# Information about Gene SLC22A3

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 6: 160,115,575-160,168,529

**Pathology:** SLC22A3 gene has been associated with various diseases such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and kidney diseases.

**Function:** SLC22A3 encodes a protein called organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), which plays a crucial role in the uptake and elimination of organic cations in tissues.

**External IDs:**
- Gene ID: 6582
- Genomic location: NC_000006.12 (160,115,575-160,168,529)
- Aliases: OCT3, MGC10774, SLC22A3_HUMAN, solute carrier family 22 member 3.
