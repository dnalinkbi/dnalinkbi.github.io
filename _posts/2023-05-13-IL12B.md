## Gene: IL12B

### Genetic Position
IL12B is located on Chromosome 5q33.3 region. It spans 5,484 base pairs and contains five exons.

### Pathology
The gene IL12B is associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Psoriasis.

### Function
The protein encoded by IL12B gene is a subunit of interleukin 12 (IL-12), which is produced by dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. It plays a crucial role in the immune system and helps in the differentiation of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells.

- Psoriasis
- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
- Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Asthma
- Celiac disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis depend on the associated disease. For example, in Crohn's disease, anti-TNF therapy, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids are used to manage the symptoms. In Multiple Sclerosis, Interferon beta treatment is used to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. 

### Drug Response
IL-12 targeted therapy is used for various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions where the gene is involved. For example, Ustekinumab is an IL-12 targeted therapy used for the treatment of psoriasis.
