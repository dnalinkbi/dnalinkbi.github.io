# CD2AP Gene Information

## Gene Position
CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p12.3) in the human genome.

## Pathology 
CD2AP has been associated with several pathologies such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.

## Function
CD2AP is an adaptor protein that plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling. It is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, endocytosis, and cell adhesion. CD2AP plays an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney.

## AA Mutation List
CD2AP has various AA mutations, but the most common variant is rs9349407, which is a missense mutation. Other AA variants for CD2AP can be found in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.

## SNVs/InDels
Several somatic SNVs and InDels have been identified in CD2AP. These variants are cataloged in the dbSNP database, such as rs6770382 and rs72683031.

## Related Disease
CD2AP mutations have been linked with several diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Mutations in CD2AP have also been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease and cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for CD2AP-related diseases. Treatment for these conditions is focused on managing the symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with CD2AP mutations depends on the specific condition and the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited research on the drug response for individuals with CD2AP mutations. However, some studies have suggested that treatments targeting CD2AP may be beneficial in certain cases of FSGS and Alzheimer's disease.
