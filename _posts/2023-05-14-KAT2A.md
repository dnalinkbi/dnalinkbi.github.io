## Information for Gene KAT2A

### Genetic Position

Gene: KAT2A

Location: Chromosome 3q26.33

### Pathology

The gene KAT2A is involved in various types of cancer and is considered as a potential target for cancer treatment. Studies have shown that KAT2A amplification is associated with the progression of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Function

The KAT2A gene encodes for a histone acetyltransferase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription. It modifies histone proteins by adding acetyl groups to their lysine residues, resulting in a more relaxed chromatin structure and increased gene transcription.

Aliases: PCAF, KAT2B

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several missense mutations reported in the KAT2A gene, including:

- p.Ile432Leu (rs150831066)
- p.Asn129Ser (rs786203184)
- p.Arg244Trp (rs371328096)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported in the KAT2A gene across various types of cancer, including:

- c.551_552delAG (rs786201049)
- c.2203G>A (rs869025410)
- c.1752C>T (rs769168700)

### Related Disease

KAT2A is associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Treatment and Prognosis

KAT2A is considered a potential target for cancer treatment. Several studies have shown that inhibition of KAT2A activity can lead to reduced tumor growth and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy.

### Drug Response

There are several drugs targeting KAT2A currently being developed, including inhibitors of its enzymatic activity. However, further research is still needed to determine their efficacy.
