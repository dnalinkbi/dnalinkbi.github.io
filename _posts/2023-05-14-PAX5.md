### Information about Gene PAX5
- **Genetic Position:** PAX5 gene is located on chromosome 9 at the location 9p13.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the PAX5 gene have been reported as a cause of leukemia and lymphoma. Aberrant expression of PAX5 has also been associated with the development of cancer.

- **Function for gene:** PAX5 gene encodes a transcription factor that is primarily expressed in B-lymphocytes and is essential for their development. It is involved in the regulation of B-cell development and maturation.

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 8586
    - NCBI Entrez: 5079
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000124216
    - OMIM: 167414
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q02548
    - Aliases: BSAP, PAX-5, B-cell specific activator protein

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID:** Some of the reported AA mutations in the PAX5 gene are:
    - G12R - rs190803477
    - R17X - rs863225495
    - Q34X - rs200876915
    - R38C - rs587776953
    - H50Q - rs863225496
    - R57W - rs794727323
    - R88S - rs1057518892
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the PAX5 gene are:
    - c.-61A>G - rs281631706
    - c.547C>T - rs756569973
    - c.977T>C - rs875989293
    - c.998T>A - rs117113091
    - c.1379A>T - rs143783450
    - c.1526G>A - rs140171324

- **Related Diseases:** Mutations in the PAX5 gene have been associated with various types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PAX5 has also been reported to be involved in the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type and stage of leukemia or lymphoma associated with PAX5 mutations.

- **Drug Response:** There are currently no drugs specifically targeted at PAX5 mutations. However, treatments like chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation can be used in combination for better prognosis.
