# Information about gene LMBRD1

LMBRD1 gene is located on chromosome 6 (6q13) and it is also known by the name of LMBD1L. This gene encodes for a membrane protein that is involved in the transport and metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12) in the body. Cobalamin is an important nutrient that is essential for the normal functioning of nerve cells and the production of red blood cells.

## Function 
The LMBRD1 gene functions as a transporter for cobalamin across the cell membrane and it is also involved in the conversion of cobalamin into its active form that can be used by the body.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 
There are currently no reported somatic variations for the LMBRD1 gene in any of the known databases.

## Related disease
Mutations in the LMBRD1 gene can cause methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblF (MMAHCF), which is a rare metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize cobalamin. Symptoms may include developmental delay, neurological problems, megaloblastic anemia, failure to thrive, and eye abnormalities.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for MMAHCF, but the treatment primarily involves the replacement of vitamin B12 and other cofactors that are required for normal metabolism. Early intervention and treatment can improve the prognosis and prevent the development of complications.

## Drug response
There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in the LMBRD1 gene.
