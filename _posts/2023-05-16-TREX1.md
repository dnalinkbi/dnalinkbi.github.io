## Information about gene TREX1

### Genetic position 

The TREX1 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3p21.31.

### Pathology and function for gene 

The TREX1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an exonuclease which degrades DNA. It plays a role in DNA repair, the maintenance of genome stability, and the prevention of autoimmunity. Mutations in this gene can lead to autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.
