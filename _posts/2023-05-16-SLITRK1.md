## Information about gene SLITRK1

### Genetic Position
* SLITRK1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q31.1).
* It spans about 88.6 kilobases (kb).

### Pathology
* SLITRK1 is associated with multiple neurological disorders, including Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
* Its variants have also been reported in other neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders.

### Function
* SLITRK1 belongs to the Slitrk family, which encodes transmembrane proteins.
* These proteins are involved in the development and function of the nervous system.
* SLITRK1 specifically regulates neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine development by modulating the Rho family of GTPases.

### External IDs and Aliases
* HGNC ID: 19861
* NCBI Entrez ID: 57646
* Ensembl ID: ENSG00000165469
* OMIM ID: 609862
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9BRX5
* Gene aliases: KIAA1919, SLITRK2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
* c.673G>A (p.Val225Met) - rs118893981

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for SLITRK1 gene.

### Related Disease
* Tourette syndrome
* Obsessive-compulsive disorder
* Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
* Autism spectrum disorder
* Schizophrenia

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for genetic variants in SLITRK1. However, therapies that target neurotransmitter systems, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been effective in treating some neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Drug Response
Different genetic variants in SLITRK1 gene can determine the drug response of some neuropsychiatric drugs.
