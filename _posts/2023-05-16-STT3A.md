# Gene Information for STT3A

## Genomic Position
STT3A is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q23.3.

## Pathology and Function
STT3A gene encodes for a catalytic subunit of N-oligosaccharyl transferase enzyme, which is involved in adding sugar molecules to proteins during post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum. This gene is essential for proper protein folding and glycosylation, and mutations in this gene are linked to congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type IT.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are various missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations reported in STT3A associated with the congenital disorder of glycosylation. The following are some of the examples: 

| Mutation Type | AA Change | dbSNP ID |
| :-----------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Missense | G55R | rs1553790707 |
| Missense | R102H | rs1378534085 |
| Missense | A441P | rs797044577 |
| Nonsense | E470* | rs1554441265 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels related to STT3A reported in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the STT3A gene are linked to a rare genetic disorder called congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type IT. The symptoms associated with CDG-I are seizures, failure to thrive, developmental delay, and other complications.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no direct cure or specific treatment for CDG-I, but managing symptoms through physiotherapy, medication, and nutritional support can be helpful. The prognosis and outcome of CDG-I patients are based on the severity of symptoms, genetic mutations, and age of onset.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs currently available that can directly target STT3A or CDG-I. However, in some cases, medications can be used to manage some of the symptoms associated with CDG-I.
