# Information about gene TUBA1A

## Genetic position 
- TUBA1A is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13.12)

## Pathology 
- Pathogenic mutations in TUBA1A are associated with a spectrum of neurological disorders including microcephaly, lissencephaly, pachygyria, and polymicrogyria. 

## Function for gene
- TUBA1A encodes for alpha-tubulin, which is a key component of microtubules that are involved in several cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape.
