## Gene NCAPD2

### Genetic Position and Genomic Information
- NCAPD2, also known as Non-SMC Condensin I Complex Subunit D2, is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13.13).
- This gene is composed of 17 exons and spans 56,681 base pairs.

### Pathology and Function
- The NCAPD2 gene encodes for a subunit of the Condensin I complex which is involved in the regulation of chromosome condensation during cell division and DNA replication.
- Mutations in NCAPD2 have been associated with a range of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer.

### External IDs and Aliases
- NCAPD2 gene external IDs: HGNC: 14640
- Genomic location: Chr 12:48,301,022-48,357,707 (+ strand)
- Aliases: CAPD2, CAP-D2, hCAP-D2

- c.1413G>A (rs143855991)

### Related Diseases
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
- Triple-negative breast cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis of NCAPD2-related cancers depend on factors such as the stage and extent of the cancer, as well as any other underlying medical conditions the patient may have. Treatment options for these cancers typically include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no information available about drug response in cases of NCAPD2-related cancers.
