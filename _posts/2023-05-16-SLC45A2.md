## Gene: SLC45A2

### Genetic Position
The SLC45A2 gene is located on chromosome 5q33.1.

### Pathology
Variations in the SLC45A2 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, including oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4) and prostate cancer.

### Function
The SLC45A2 gene encodes a protein called membrane-associated transporter protein (MATP) that is involved in regulating melanin synthesis and pigmentation in the eyes, skin, and hair.

- p.Arg77Leu, Missense, rs121918165
- p.Arg282His, Missense, rs121918167

### Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the SLC45A2 gene.

### Related Disease
Genetic variants in the SLC45A2 gene are associated with OCA4, which is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by reduced melanin pigmentation in the eyes, hair, and skin.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for OCA4. Treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms of the condition, which may include vision correction, increased protection from sun exposure, and supportive therapy for common skin and hair problems.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug treatment for OCA4.
