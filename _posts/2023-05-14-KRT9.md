# Gene Information: KRT9

## Gene Position and Pathology
- Gene: KRT9 (Keratin 9)
- Locus: Chromosome 17q21.2
- Pathology: This gene is associated with Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK) and Striate palmoplantar keratoderma (SPPK).
 
## Gene Function 
- KRT9 encodes a member of the keratin family, which is essential in the production of hair, nails, and the outer layer of skin. More specifically, KRT9 is required for the structural integrity of the keratinocytes in the epidermis of palms and soles.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Entrez Gene ID: 3869
- HGNC ID: 6446
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000140421
- OMIM ID: 607606
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P35527
- Aliases: KRT1I, CK9, K9, KRTA9.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several reported mutations in the KRT9 gene, which are mainly missense mutations that substitute a single amino acid. Some common KRT9 mutations include:
    - p.Arg158His (R158H) [dbSNP: rs121908630]
    - p.Arg162Gly (R162G) [dbSNP: rs34529182]
    - p.Arg162Trp (R162W) [dbSNP: rs121908631]
    - p.Arg337Trp (R337W) [dbSNP: rs121908632]
    - p.Gly447Arg (G447R) [dbSNP: rs121908633]

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID are reported in the KRT9 gene.

## Related Disease
- Mutations in KRT9 causes Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK). It is an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by hyperkeratosis and focal granular degeneration of the epidermis in the palms and soles. Mutations in KRT9 and KRT1 can also cause Striate palmoplantar keratoderma (SPPK), which is characterized by thick, yellow-brown-colored hyperkeratotic plaques with deep fissures on the soles of the feet and occasionally on the palms of the hands.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for EPPK and SPPK, but treatment can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment options include topical keratolytics, topical retinoids, and oral retinoids. It is important to note that the severity of symptoms and disease progression varies widely between individuals.

## Drug Response
- Currently, there are no specific drugs available that target KRT9 mutations. However, some studies suggest that systemic retinoids could potentially benefit some individuals with EPPK.
