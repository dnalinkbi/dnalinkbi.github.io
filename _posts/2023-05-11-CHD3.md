# Information about Gene CHD3 

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 
- **Genetic position**: CHD3 is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 at position 21.31.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in CHD3 have been linked to various diseases, including autism and cancer.
- **Function**: CHD3 encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein family, which is involved in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and other nuclear processes.
