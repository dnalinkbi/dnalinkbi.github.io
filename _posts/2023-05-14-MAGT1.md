# Information about Gene MAGT1

## Genetic Position and Genomic Information

- **Gene Name:** MAGT1
- **Chromosome:** X
- **Locus:** Xq21.1
- **Aliases:** XMAGT1, DXS1318E, DKFZp686F12105

## Function for Gene

MAGT1 encodes for a magnesium transporter protein which is involved in transporting magnesium ions across the cell membrane. Magnesium is involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair, protein synthesis, and metabolism.
