## Gene FXYD6

**Function:** The protein encoded by the FXYD6 gene belongs to the FXYD family of transmembrane proteins. This gene is specifically expressed in the kidney and plays a role in regulating sodium-potassium ATPase activity in renal tubules. 

**External IDs:** Gene ID: 53827; Genomic location: Chromosome 11q23.1; Aliases: Phosphohippolin, FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 6.

**Related disease:** FXYD6 mutations have been associated with renal tubular dysgenesis and distal renal tubular acidosis.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for renal tubular dysgenesis and distal renal tubular acidosis typically involves managing symptoms and complications. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

**Drug response:** There are no known drugs specifically targeting FXYD6. Treatment for renal tubular dysgenesis and distal renal tubular acidosis involves managing symptoms and complications using a combination of medications.
