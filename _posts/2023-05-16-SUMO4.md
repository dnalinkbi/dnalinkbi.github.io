## Information about gene SUMO4 

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location

The SUMO4 gene is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q25.2 and spans 2,069 base pairs. 

### Pathology 

Variants in the SUMO4 gene have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 

### Function 

The SUMO4 gene encodes a protein called "Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 4" (SUMO4), which belongs to the family of ubiquitin-like proteins. The SUMO4 protein is involved in post-translational modifications of other proteins through the process of SUMOylation, which regulates protein stability, activity, and localization. 

### External IDs and Aliases 

- HGNC: 11454 
- NCBI Entrez: 387082 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000204514 
- OMIM: 606873 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6EEV6 

Aliases for SUMO4 include SMT3 suppressor of mif two 3 homolog 4, ubiquitin-like protein SMT3C, and sentrin protein SMT3H4. 

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID 

Several non-synonymous variants in the SUMO4 gene have been reported, including:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R55Q | Missense | rs237025 |
| G100A | Missense | rs729302 |
| L55P | Missense | rs2239610 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the SUMO4 gene.

### Related Diseases 

Variants in the SUMO4 gene have been associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including:

- Type 1 diabetes 
- Rheumatoid arthritis 
- Systemic lupus erythematosus 

### Treatment and Prognosis 

There is currently no specific treatment for diseases caused by SUMO4 variants. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms. 

### Drug Response 

There is currently no known drug response associated with the SUMO4 gene.
