## Gene SDHD

### Information
- Genetic Position: 11q23.1
- Pathology: The mutations in gene SDHD cause paragangliomas, which is a type of tumor that occurs in the nerve cells. 
- Function: SDHD encodes a membrane-bound hydrophilic protein that is a subunit of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase complex, which is involved in the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. It is responsible for the oxidation of succinate to fumarate.

### Related Disease
- Paragangliomas 

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for paragangliomas generally consists of surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. The prognosis depends on the stage and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. 

### Drug Response
- There is limited information about drug response related to SDHD mutations.
