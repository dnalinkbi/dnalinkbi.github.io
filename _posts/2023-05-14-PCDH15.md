## Information about gene PCDH15

- **Genetic position**: The PCDH15 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 at position 21.1.

- **Pathology**: Mutations in the PCDH15 gene have been associated with various forms of deafness, including autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss and Usher syndrome.

- **Function for gene**: PCDH15 encodes a protein called protocadherin 15, which is a member of the cadherin superfamily of proteins. Protocadherin 15 is specifically expressed in sensory hair cells of the inner ear, where it plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of these cells.

  - NCBI Entrez: 65217
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000154261
  - OMIM: 605514
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6N7
  - Alias: CDHR15, PCDH23, USH1F

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Numerous mutations in the PCDH15 gene have been identified in individuals with hearing loss or Usher syndrome. Some examples of missense mutations include:
  - c.1580G>A (p.Arg527His) rs121909394
  - c.1975C>T (p.Arg659Cys) rs104894413
  - c.1784G>A (p.Arg595Gln) rs104894414
  
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Information not available.

- **Related disease**: Mutations in PCDH15 have been associated with several types of hearing loss, including:
  - Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB23)
  - Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F)
  - DFNX11 (a type of X-linked hearing loss)

- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is currently no cure for hearing loss caused by PCDH15 mutations. Treatment typically involves the use of hearing aids or cochlear implants to help individuals with hearing loss communicate and function in daily life.

- **Drug response**: There are no drugs currently available that specifically target PCDH15 mutations.
