# Gene: TNFRSF13B

**Genetic Position and Pathology:** 

TNFRSF13B (Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B), also known as TACI (Transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor) is located on chromosome 17q22-24. TNFRSF13B regulates immune responses and helps in the maturation of B cells. Pathologically, mutations in TNFRSF13B have been linked to common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and IgA deficiency.

**Function for Gene:**

TNFRSF13B encodes a receptor protein which is found on the surface of immune cells like B cells. It binds to a protein called BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) which is crucial for the survival and maturation of B cells. TNFRSF13B also plays a role in the regulation of immunoglobulin class switching - the process by which the immune system generates different classes of antibodies.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported in TNFRSF13B:
- c.125G>A (p.Trp42Ter) - rs104895071
- c.586G>A (p.Arg196Gln) - rs145304162
- c.789G>A (p.Glu263Lys) - rs137853238
- c.1057G>A (p.Gly353Asp) - rs146538651
- c.1136C>T (p.Arg379Ter) - rs2305952

These mutations cause changes in the TNFRSF13B protein leading to defects in B cell maturation, differentiation and function.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no reported somatic mutations affecting TNFRSF13B.

**Related Disease:**

Mutations in TNFRSF13B have been linked to primary antibody deficiency disorders like Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) and IgA deficiency. CVID is a genetic immunodeficiency disorder that causes a decreased ability to fight infections. Patients with CVID have low levels of immunoglobulins in their blood, especially IgG and IgA, which can lead to an increased risk of infections.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

CVID is managed by treating infections as they arise, and by replacing the deficient immunoglobulins with infusions of immunoglobulin G (IgG). TNFRSF13B-deficient patients often do not respond well to antibiotics and may require long term immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

**Drug Response:**

There is no reported drug response data for TNFRSF13B.
