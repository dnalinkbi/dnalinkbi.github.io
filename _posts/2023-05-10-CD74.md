# CD74 Gene

## Genetic Position
The CD74 gene is located on chromosome 5 at the location 5q33.1. It has a reverse orientation.

## Pathology
CD74 plays an important role as an antigen-presenting molecule. It is involved in the differentiation and survival of B cells and dendritic cells, activation of T cells, and regulation of inflammatory responses. Alterations in CD74 expression or function are associated with several disorders, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. 

## Function
The CD74 gene encodes for the protein MHC class II-associated invariant chain, which is involved in antigen processing and presentation. CD74 binds to the MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates the transport of antigenic peptides to the MHC class II molecules. It also has a role in signaling processes that regulate immune cell activation and inflammation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
CD74 has several Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) which lead to amino acid changes. Some of them are:
- rs2269426: c.999G>A (p.Gly333Ser)
- rs1799864: c.411G>A (p.Gly137Asp)
- rs11687442: c.1196T>C (p.Leu399Pro)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs34403734: c.802G>T (p.Asp268Tyr)
- rs201520889: c.1168A>G (p.Asn390Ser)
- rs3747799: c.1162A>T (p.Ser388Cys)

## Related Disease
CD74 has been linked to several diseases, including:
- Cancer (e.g., melanoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer)
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus)

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options depend on the underlying disease. For instance, monoclonal antibodies targeting CD74 are currently being investigated for the treatment of cancer. The prognosis depends on several factors, including the disease stage, type, and response to treatment.

## Drug Response
CD74-targeting drugs have shown promising results in preclinical studies. For example, the antibody STA-5326 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of breast cancer and melanoma.
