# Information about gene NXNL1

**Genetic position**: The gene NXNL1 is located on the chromosome 6p21.1. 

**Pathology**: Mutations in the gene NXNL1 have been associated with retinal diseases, including cone dystrophy and macular degeneration.

**Function**: The protein encoded by NXNL1 is involved in the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the eye. 

**External IDs and Aliases**: The gene NXNL1 is also known as NMNAT1L, NMNAT-1L, and RP64. The Ensembl ID for this gene is ENSG00000112561, and the HGNC ID is HGNC:25564. The NCBI Entrez Gene ID is 283576.

**Related diseases**: Cone dystrophy and macular degeneration have been linked to mutations in the NXNL1 gene. 

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Some of the mutations reported in the NXNL1 gene include:

- c.268C>T p.(Arg90Cys) rs144024011
- c.269A>G p.(Lys90Glu) rs7542560
- c.853G>A p.(Arg285His) rs144593595
- c.1318A>C p.(Asn440His) rs555952628

These mutations are missense variants, which change a single amino acid in the encoded protein.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: No somatic variants of NXNL1 have been reported in the dbSNP database.

**Treatment and prognosis**: There is currently no cure for cone dystrophy or macular degeneration caused by NXNL1 mutations. Treatment options aim to manage the symptoms of these conditions, such as using corrective lenses or vision aids. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the disease.

**Drug response**: No information is currently available about drug response specific to mutations in NXNL1.
