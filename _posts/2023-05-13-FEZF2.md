## Gene Information

**Gene:** FEZF2

**Function:** FEZF2 belongs to the FEZF (FEZ family zinc finger) transcription factor family that plays essential roles in neuronal development by regulating the expression of downstream genes. FEZF2 plays a crucial role in neural differentiation, migration, and axon guidance, and it controls the development of thalamic nuclei, subplate, and layer IV of the cerebral cortex.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: HGNC:3602
- NCBI Entrez: 9639
- Ensembl: ENSG00000123560
- OMIM: 605426
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IZX4

**Aliases:** FEZ family zinc finger 2, ZNF312B
