# Information about Gene NPY1R

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Gene Position:** The NPY1R gene is located on the chromosome 4q31.3 region.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the NPY1R gene have been found to be associated with various diseases including osteoporosis and obesity.

- **Function:** The NPY1R gene encodes for the neuropeptide Y receptor Y1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor. It plays an essential role in the regulation of various physiological functions, including food intake, energy metabolism, bone formation, and stress response.

## Gene External IDs and Aliases

- **External IDs:** 
	- HGNC: 7971
	- NCBI Entrez: 4886
	- Ensembl: ENSG00000138796
	- OMIM: 162640
	- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P25929

- **Aliases:** NPY1 receptor, NPY-Y1 receptor, Neuropeptide Y receptor Y1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- There are several known missense mutations in the NPY1R gene, including:
	- Gln34Arg (rs10472124)
	- Ser38Cys (rs5574)
	- Leu53Ile (rs3037354)
	- Ile60Val (rs2234759)
	- Leu99Phe (rs10274682)
	- Val279Leu (rs5572)

- These mutations are all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that result in an amino acid change in the receptor protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the NPY1R gene.

## Related Disease

- Mutations in the NPY1R gene have been associated with various diseases, including:
	- Obesity
	- Osteoporosis

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no specific treatment for NPY1R-related diseases.

## Drug Response

- Studies suggest that drugs targeting NPY1R, such as BIBP3226 and GR231118, could be used to treat obesity and various metabolic disorders.
