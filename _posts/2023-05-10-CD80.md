# Gene Information Analysis: CD80

## Gene Description
CD80 (Cluster of Differentiation 80) is a gene that encodes a cell surface receptor protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It functions as a co-stimulatory molecule that is involved in the activation of T-cells. 

## Gene Function
The CD80 protein serves as a ligand for two receptors found on T-cells: CD28 and CTLA-4. Engagement of CD28 by CD80 leads to the activation of T-cells, while engagement of CTLA-4 by CD80 results in the inhibition of T-cell activation. 

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- **HGNC**: 1698
- **NCBI Entrez**: 941
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000121594
- **OMIM**: 112203
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P33681

The CD80 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the band 3q13.3.

## Related Disease
Deficiencies in the CD80 protein have been implicated in various autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, dysregulation of the CD80 pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some cancers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting CD80 has emerged as a potential treatment approach in autoimmune disorders. Clinical trials investigating the use of anti-CD80 antibodies as a therapy for autoimmune diseases are ongoing. The prognosis for patients with CD80-related diseases varies depending on disease severity and the effectiveness of available treatments.

## Drug Response
Several drugs that target the CD80 pathway are currently in development for use in autoimmune disorders and cancer. Abatacept, a soluble fusion protein consisting of CTLA-4 and the Fc region of IgG1, can block the interaction between CD80 and CD28 and has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
