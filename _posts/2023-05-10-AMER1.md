# Information about Gene AMER1

## Genetic Position

AMER1 is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq11.2). It spans over 150 kilobases and contains 13 exons.

## Pathology and Function

AMER1, also known as WTX or FAM123B, is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting β-catenin. Mutations in AMER1 lead to overactivation of the Wnt pathway, which has been found to be a common feature in a variety of cancers, particularly Wilms tumor and osteosarcoma.

## Gene Information

- **Function:** Tumor suppressor gene. Regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting β-catenin.

## Related Disease

Mutations in AMER1 have been associated with several types of cancer, including:

- Wilms tumor
- Osteosarcoma
- Colorectal cancer
- Lung cancer
- Breast cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no known cure for AMER1-related cancers. Treatment options depend on the type and stage of cancer and can include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. The prognosis for AMER1-related cancers varies and is dependent on several factors, including the stage of cancer, the type of cancer, and the patient’s overall health.

## Drug Response

There is no known targeted therapy for AMER1-related cancers. However, ongoing research is investigating potential drug targets in the Wnt signaling pathway.
