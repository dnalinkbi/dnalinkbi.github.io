# Information about gene CPN1

## Gene and Genomic Location
- Gene: CPN1 (Carboxypeptidase N subunit 1)
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10 (NC_000010.11): 60,078,876 - 60,103,963

## Pathology and Function
- Pathology:
  - CPN1 mutations are found in patients with autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis), chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and liver cancer.
- Function:
  - The protein encoded by CPN1 is a carboxypeptidase that cleaves off the C-terminal amino acid from peptides and proteins. It plays a role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including blood coagulation, inflammation, and cancer progression.
