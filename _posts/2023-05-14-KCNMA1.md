## Gene: KCNMA1
- Function: The KCNMA1 gene encodes for a protein known as a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (also called BK, Maxi-K, or Slo1). This channel is found in various tissues and plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle contraction, and neuronal excitability.
