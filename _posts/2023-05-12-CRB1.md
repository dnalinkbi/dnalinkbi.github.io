## Gene Information

### Gene Name: CRB1

### Function for Gene
CRB1 gene encodes a protein that belongs to a family of transmembrane proteins, which play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye. The protein is important for the integrity of the outer limiting membrane, which is essential for maintaining the organization of retinal cells and their communication with each other.

### Location and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: 23457, NCBI Entrez Gene: 23418, Ensembl: ENSG00000130829, OMIM: 604210, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y4K2
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1p31.3

### AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ser435Leu (rs180537402)
- p.Leu1405Phe (rs770176791)
- p.Arg767Ter (rs121908369)
- p.Leu23Pro (rs180537391)
- p.Asp424Gly (rs773234511)
- Mutation type: missense, nonsense, frameshift

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels with dbSNP ID for CRB1 gene.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in the CRB1 gene are associated with a variety of inherited retinal disorders, including:
- Retinitis pigmentosa (RP)
- Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA)
- Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD)
- Pigmentary retinopathy

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for inherited retinal diseases caused by mutations in the CRB1 gene. However, several approaches are being developed to slow the progression of these disorders and to improve patients' quality of life. These include gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and drug treatments. The prognosis for individuals with CRB1-associated retinal disorders depends on the specific type of disease and the severity of symptoms, but most people with these conditions experience a gradual loss of vision over time.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response specific to CRB1-associated retinal disorders at this time.
