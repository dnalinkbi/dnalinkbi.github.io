# Gene: SIM2

## Genetic Position 
- Chromosome: 21q22.3
- Start position: 40001015 bp
- End position: 40146428 bp

## Pathology
SIM2 gene has been found to be associated with developmental disorders like autism and Down syndrome. Studies suggest that the SIM2 gene also plays a role in cancer progression. 

## Function 
SIM2 gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in important developmental processes like neuronal development, differentiation, and cell migration. It is also involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm and glucose homeostasis.
