# Information about gene PIK3CD

## Genetic Position
- The PIK3CD gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1p36.22).

## Pathology
- Mutations in the PIK3CD gene have been associated with primary immunodeficiency diseases, specifically activated PI3K-delta syndrome (APDS) and combined immunodeficiency.
- APDS is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the PIK3CD gene, which lead to hyperactivation of the PI3K-delta signaling pathway.

## Function
- PIK3CD encodes the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K-delta), which is an enzyme that plays an important role in cell signaling, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not applicable.

## Related Diseases
- APDS
- Combined immunodeficiency

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for APDS may include medication to manage symptoms, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and bone marrow transplant.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response
- There are currently no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of APDS, but there are ongoing clinical trials of drugs targeting the PI3K-delta pathway.
