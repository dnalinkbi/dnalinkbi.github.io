## Gene Information for GPHN

### Genetic Position
- GPHN is located on human chromosome 14q24.3.
- Its genomic coordinates are 76,838,448 to 76,907,373.

### Function for Gene
- The GPHN gene encodes a protein called gephyrin.
- Gephyrin is a scaffold protein that clusters and anchors inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, such as the glycine and GABA-A receptors, to the post-synaptic membrane at the inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system.
- Therefore, gephyrin is essential for the proper functioning of the inhibitory circuits in the brain.

### Gene and Genomic Location
- Gene ID: 10243
- Genomic location: 14q24.3
- Alias: GPH, MPRIP

- Some of the common ones with their dbSNP IDs are:
  - c.1072C>G (rs1552512355)
  - c.1213G>A (rs1552518588)
  - c.1453C>T (rs1552520923)

### Related Diseases
- Mutations in the GPHN gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including:
  - Hyperekplexia (OMIM: 149400)
  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (OMIM: 608636)
  - Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (OMIM: 604233)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no specific treatment available for GPHN-related disorders.
- However, some of the symptoms can be managed with medication, physical therapy, and behavioral interventions.
- The prognosis depends on the severity of the disorder and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug responses for GPHN-related disorders.
- However, some studies have shown that compounds that target the glycine and GABA-A receptors can improve the symptoms of hyperekplexia.
