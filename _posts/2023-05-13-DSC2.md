# Gene DSC2

## Genetic Position 
- Chromosome: 18
- Location: p11.2
- Strand: -
- Genomic Position: 3,267,818 - 3,306,753 bp

## Pathology and Function
- DSC2 gene encodes for a protein called desmocollin-2, which is an important component of desmosomes in cardiac tissue.
- These desmosomes are responsible for the mechanical stability of cardiac tissue.
- Mutations in DSC2 may lead to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which is characterized by the replacement of healthy cardiac tissue with fibrous or fatty tissue. 
- ARVC can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

## Related Disease
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for ARVC includes implantation of defibrillators to correct abnormal heart rhythms.
- Some studies have suggested that modification of specific genes, including DSC2, may be a potential therapeutic target for ARVC.
- Prognosis for ARVC varies and is dependent on the severity of the disease and effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response
- Research is ongoing to investigate potential drug therapies for ARVC, but as of now, there are no specific drugs approved for treatment.
