# Gene SNAPC5

## Genetic position
The gene SNAPC5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q21).

## Pathology
Mutations in the SNAPC5 gene have been associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay.

## Function
The SNAPC5 gene encodes for a protein subunit of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex SNAPc, which is responsible for the activation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. These snRNAs are important for the processing of pre-mRNAs in the cell.
