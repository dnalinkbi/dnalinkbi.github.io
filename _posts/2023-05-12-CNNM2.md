# Information about gene CNNM2

## Genetic Position
The CNNM2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10, specifically on the position 10q24.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CNNM2 gene have been identified as a cause of hypomagnesemia with seizures. This disease is characterized by low magnesium levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, accompanied by seizures and other neurological symptoms.

## Function
The CNNM2 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the ancient conserved domain protein (ACDP) family, which is involved in magnesium homeostasis. Specifically, the CNNM2 protein acts as a magnesium transporter, regulating the uptake of magnesium ions into cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations within the CNNM2 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related disease
Mutations in the CNNM2 gene have been associated with hypomagnesemia with seizures, as mentioned above.

## Treatment and prognosis
Hypomagnesemia with seizures can be treated with magnesium supplementation and anticonvulsant medications. Prognosis may depend on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug response
There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in the CNNM2 gene.
