# Gene: DAXX

## Genetic Position
The DAXX gene is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6p21.33.

## Pathology
DAXX gene has been found to be involved in various cancers. It has been reported that mutations in DAXX are associated with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Additionally, it has been found that the loss of DAXX expression is linked to the progression of different cancer types, such as breast, gastric and thyroid cancers.

## Function
DAXX gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. It also functions in regulating the activity of several transcription factors, including p53, NF-ÎºB, and SMAD4.

## Related Diseases
The mutations in the DAXX gene have been found to be associated with various diseases, including:
- Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
- Gastric Cancer
- Thyroid Cancer
- Breast Cancer
- Preeclampsia
- Aneurysms
- Glioblastomas

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options for DAXX-related disorders depend on the specific disease. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with DAXX mutations have been found to be sensitive to DNA-damaging agents such as temozolomide. The prognosis for DAXX-related disorders depends on the specific disease, stage, and available treatments.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug designed for DAXX mutations or related diseases. However, the DNA-damaging agent temozolomide shows therapeutic efficacy against certain DAXX-mutated neoplasms.
