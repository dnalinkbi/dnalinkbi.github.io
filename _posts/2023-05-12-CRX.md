## Gene: CRX

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Location: p13.3
- Strand: Plus

### Pathology
Mutations in the CRX gene are associated with retinal diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), cone-rod dystrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

### Function
The CRX gene encodes for cone-rod homeobox protein, which plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina.

### Related Disease
- Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA)
- cone-rod dystrophy
- retinitis pigmentosa (RP)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for retinal diseases caused by CRX mutations. Treatment options include gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and supportive measures such as low vision aids.

### Drug Response
There is limited research on drug response specific to CRX mutations.
