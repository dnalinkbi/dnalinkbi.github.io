# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene GSTO1

## Gene Information
**Gene name:** GSTO1

**Function:** The GSTO1 gene encodes a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily, which functions in detoxification and antioxidant processes.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 4624
- NCBI Entrez: 2953
- Ensembl: ENSG00000168484
- OMIM: 609304
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HBG9

**Aliases:**
- GSTTLP28
- GSTTLp28

## Genetic Position
**Chromosome:** 10

**Genomic Location:** 10q25.1

## Mutations and SNPs
**AA mutation list:**
- p.Glu155Asp (rs4925)
- p.Ala140Thr (rs56063822)

Both of the above mutations are missense mutations. 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

## Related Disease
There is evidence to suggest that the GSTO1 gene is associated with various diseases including:
- Alzheimer's disease 
- Parkinson's disease 
- Asthma 
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
As of now, there are no known treatments or procedures that specifically target GSTO1 gene. Therefore, the prognosis of the associated diseases may depend on the severity of the disease and the mode of treatment adopted. 

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that the GSTO1 gene can affect drug response. Specifically, individuals with certain mutations in GSTO1 are more susceptible to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) when taking the drug diclofenac.
