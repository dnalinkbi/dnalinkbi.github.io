# Gene AARS2 

## Function:
The AARS2 gene encodes an enzyme, alanyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which is responsible for catalyzing the aminoacylation of alanine or alanine derivatives to glutamate in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. This aminoacylation process is essential for the accurate translation of genetic information from RNA to protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs/InDels were found for AARS2 in dbSNP.

## Related disease:
Mutations in AARS2 have been associated with autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy with ovarian failure (LWO syndrome). This is a rare disorder characterized by progressive leukoencephalopathy (deterioration of the white matter in the brain) and premature ovarian failure.

## Treatment and prognosis:
There is no known cure for LWO syndrome. Treatment usually involves managing symptoms and providing supportive care.

## Drug response:
There is currently no specific drug available for the treatment of LWO syndrome.
