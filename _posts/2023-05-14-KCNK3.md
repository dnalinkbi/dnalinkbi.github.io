# Gene KCNK3

## Gene information
- **Function**: The KCNK3 gene encodes for the potassium channel protein TASK-1 that regulates the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes in various tissues. It plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac and respiratory functions, as well as neurological processes such as pain sensitivity.
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 2 (2p23.3)
- **Aliases**: K2P3.1, TASK-1, KCNK9

## External IDs and sites

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No information available.

## Related disease
- Mutations in the KCNK3 gene have been linked to familial atrial fibrillation (FAF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

## Treatment and prognosis
- Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting KCNK3 for the treatment of FAF or PAH. Treatment for FAF usually involves medications that regulate heart rhythm or procedures to restore normal heart rhythm. Treatment for PAH involves medications that dilate the blood vessels in the lungs or prevent excessive blood clotting.
- The prognosis for both FAF and PAH varies depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug response
- There is currently limited information on drug response for mutations in the KCNK3 gene. Further research is needed to determine potential drug targets for the treatment of FAF and PAH.
