# Information about Gene FLT3

## Basic Information
- Gene: FLT3 (Fms Related Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3)
- Genomic location: Chromosome 13q12
- Aliases: CD135, STK1 
- External IDs: HGNC: 3765, NCBI Entrez: 2322, Ensembl: ENSG00000122025, OMIM: 136351, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P36888

## Function
The FLT3 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. It also contributes to the maintenance of normal immune function.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the FLT3 gene have been associated with various types of leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These mutations often result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and impaired differentiation.

## Treatment and Prognosis
FLT3 inhibitors, such as gilteritinib and midostaurin, have shown efficacy in treating FLT3-mutated AML patients. However, the prognosis for these patients is generally poor, with high rates of relapse and low overall survival rates.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that FLT3 mutations can impact the response to chemotherapy and targeted therapy in leukemia patients. FLT3 inhibitors have shown promise in improving patient outcomes, particularly when used in combination with other agents.
