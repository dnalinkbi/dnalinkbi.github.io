# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene SEMA3E

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** SEMA3E
- **Aliases:** SEMAJ, SemE, SEMA5, SEMAF, FLJ14467
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 7 (7q21.11)
- **External IDs:** HGNC:14476, NCBI Entrez:9723, Ensembl:ENSG00000106106, OMIM:608166, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:O15067

## Function
SEMA3E encodes a member of the semaphorin family of secreted and membrane-bound proteins. It plays a role in axon guidance during neural development and also has roles in angiogenesis and tumor progression.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported in SEMA3E.
- p.Arg670His (rs55831000)
- p.Arg668Pro (rs78050804)
- p.Thr442Met (rs143141068)
- p.Arg233Gln (rs758712942)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported in SEMA3E.
- c.2343_2344delTGinsAA (rs747791675)
- c.1979A>G (rs885979643)
- c.1729A>G (rs446336308)

## Related Disease
SEMA3E mutations are associated with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for SEMA3E-related disorders. The treatment is based on the symptoms and can include medications, behavioral therapy, and educational services. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs currently approved specifically for SEMA3E-related disorders. However, drugs targeting the pathway in which SEMA3E is involved, such as VEGF inhibitors, are being investigated as potential therapies.
