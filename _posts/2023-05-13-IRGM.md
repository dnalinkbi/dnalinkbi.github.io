# Gene IRGM
- **Function:** IRGM (Immunity-Related GTPase family M) is involved in autophagy, which is a cellular process responsible for the degradation of cytoplasmic materials, including pathogens and damaged organelles. IRGM is also implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and antigen presentation.
- **External IDs and genomic location:**
    - **HGNC ID:** 6098
    - **NCBI Entrez Gene:** 84639
    - **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000133630
    - **OMIM ID:** 610458
    - **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9GZR3
    - **Genomic location:** Chromosome 5: 131,285,513-131,308,287
    - **Aliases:** LRG-47, GADL1, IGTP, IRGM1
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.313C>T (p.Thr105Met) - rs4958842
    - c.616G>A (p.Cys206Tyr) - rs10065172
    - c.851G>A (p.Val284Ile) - rs4958841
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported
- **Related disease:** IRGM has been associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, leprosy, and tuberculosis.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** No specific treatment or prognosis information is available for IRGM-related diseases.
- **Drug response:** Studies have suggested that IRGM could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and leprosy.
