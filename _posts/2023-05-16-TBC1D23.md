## TBC1D23 Gene Information
- **Function for gene:** The TBC1D23 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) protein family. This protein family is characterized by having a conserved TBC domain that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab proteins and regulates intracellular membrane trafficking.
