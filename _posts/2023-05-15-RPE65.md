# Gene: RPE65

## Genetic Position

The RPE65 gene is located on chromosome 1, specifically in the band 1p31.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in the RPE65 gene have been associated with several inherited retinal diseases, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and early-onset severe retinal dystrophy.

## Function for gene

The RPE65 gene encodes a protein called retinoid isomerohydrolase, which is essential for the production of 11-cis retinal in the visual cycle. 11-cis retinal is a crucial component of rhodopsin, the protein responsible for detecting light in the retina.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the RPE65 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the RPE65 gene have been associated with several inherited retinal diseases, including:

- Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)
- Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)
- Early-Onset Severe Retinal Dystrophy

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for the inherited retinal diseases associated with mutations in the RPE65 gene. However, there are several treatments that can help slow down the progression of vision loss, including gene therapy, oral supplements, and low-vision aids.

## Drug Response

There are no drugs specifically targeted towards RPE65 mutation-related diseases but some clinical trials are ongoing.
