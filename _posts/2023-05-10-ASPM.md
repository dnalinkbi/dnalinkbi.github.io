# Gene: ASPM

The ASPM gene (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein) is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q31.3. It spans about 600 kbp and contains 28 exons. The ASPM gene codes for the ASPM protein, which is important during brain development.

## Function for gene
The ASPM gene is involved in the regulation of neurogenesis, specifically in the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells during brain development. Mutations in the ASPM gene can lead to microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head circumference and intellectual disability.
