## Information about Gene EEF1A2

### Genetic Position
Gene EEF1A2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.33).

### Function for Gene
The EEF1A2 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 protein, which is involved in protein synthesis. This protein is expressed in skeletal muscle tissues and is believed to play a role in the regulation of muscle fiber size and strength.
