# Gene NR1H3

## Genetic Position
The gene NR1H3 is located on chromosome 12 at the position 56,840,248-56,871,392 (GRCh38).

## Pathology
NR1H3 gene plays an important role in lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several diseases, such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.

## Function for Gene
The NR1H3 gene encodes for a protein known as liver X receptor alpha (LXRα). It acts as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, it plays a role in inflammation, immunity, and cellular differentiation.

## Related Disease
- Atherosclerosis
- Coronary artery disease
- Inflammatory bowel disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease that is associated with NR1H3 gene mutations. For instance, in the case of atherosclerosis, treatments such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, and niacin can be used to lower cholesterol levels and prevent the progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs specifically designed to target NR1H3 gene mutations. However, drugs that target cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, such as statins and fibrates, can be used to manage the symptoms associated with diseases caused by NR1H3 mutations.
