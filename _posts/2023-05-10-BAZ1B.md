# Gene BAZ1B

## General Information
- Function: The BAZ1B gene encodes a protein that has been associated with chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is a member of the WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling complex, which can alter the association of histones with DNA and change how DNA is packaged into chromatin.
- External IDs for gene: HGNC:953, NCBI Entrez:9031, Ensembl:ENSG00000162418, OMIM:301255, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:O60220
- Genomic location: Chr 7q11.23
- Aliases: WSTF, WBSCR9


## Variations and Diseases
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    - p.Y1210C missense variation with dbSNP ID rs34304568
    - p.T1535A missense variation with dbSNP ID rs62067005
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported

- Related disease: BAZ1B haploinsufficiency has been linked to a range of developmental and neurological disorders, including:
    - Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS)
    - Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS)
    - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: There is currently no cure for genetic disorders linked to BAZ1B mutations. Treatment is generally focused on managing symptoms and may include various therapies, special education, and medication. 
- Prognosis: Prognosis varies widely depending on the specific diagnosis and severity of the disorder.

## Drug Response
- No specific drug response has been reported for BAZ1B mutations.
