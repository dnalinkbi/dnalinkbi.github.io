# Information on Gene PTCH1
---

### Gene Function
PTCH1 (Patched 1) is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 9q22.2-q31.3. It plays a crucial role in the hedgehog signaling pathway by inhibiting the activity of smoothened, a protein that promotes cell growth and division. PTCH1 regulates cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as normal embryonic development.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in PTCH1 have been linked to several diseases, including:
- Basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS)
- Medulloblastoma
- Gorlin-Goltz syndrome
- Cardiac fibroma

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for patients with PTCH1 mutations depend on the disease and the severity of symptoms. In many cases, surgery or chemotherapy is required. The prognosis can vary widely, and some patients may require ongoing treatment and monitoring.

### Drug Response
Drugs targeting the hedgehog signaling pathway have been developed, including vismodegib and sonidegib. They have shown some success in treating medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma, which are associated with PTCH1 mutations.
