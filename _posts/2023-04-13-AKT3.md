# Gene AKT3

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

AKT3 gene is located on chromosome 1 in humans and encodes the serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT3. The AKT3 protein plays a critical role in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. Dysregulation of AKT3 has been associated with multiple diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.

### Gene Function

The AKT3 gene is a member of the AKT family of kinases, which are involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is activated by various growth factors, cytokines, and hormones and regulates multiple cellular processes. The AKT3 protein is involved in the regulation of cell survival, growth, proliferation, and metabolism by mediating the phosphorylation of downstream targets. It also plays a role in cellular differentiation and migration.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Several coding mutations have been reported in the AKT3 gene. The most studied mutations are:

- E17K: This mutation involves the substitution of glutamic acid to lysine at position 17 (E17K). It is a somatic mutation that activates the kinase activity of AKT3 and has been reported in various cancer types, including breast, colon, and ovarian cancers. (dbSNP ID: rs121434592)
- R25C: This mutation involves the substitution of arginine to cysteine at position 25 (R25C). It is associated with a rare form of epilepsy called megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH). (dbSNP ID: rs137853645)
- G257D: This mutation involves the substitution of glycine to aspartic acid at position 257 (G257D). It has been associated with autistic disorder and developmental delay. (dbSNP ID: rs369727178)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in AKT3 gene in various cancer types. The most common somatic mutations are:

- G49A: This somatic mutation involves the substitution of guanine to adenine at position 49 (G49A). It has been reported in colon and lung cancers. (dbSNP ID: rs1802238)
- Q62E: This somatic mutation involves the substitution of glutamine to glutamic acid at position 62 (Q62E). It has been reported in ovarian and pancreatic cancers. (dbSNP ID: rs121434591)
- R86Q: This somatic mutation involves the substitution of arginine to glutamine at position 86 (R86Q). It has been reported in ovarian and breast cancers. (dbSNP ID: rs121434593)

### Related Disease

Dysregulation of AKT3 has been associated with multiple diseases, including:

- Cancer: AKT3 is overexpressed or mutated in various cancer types, including breast, colon, ovarian, and lung cancers. AKT3 activation contributes to cancer cell survival, proliferation, and resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies.
- Neurodevelopmental Disorders: AKT3 mutations have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH), macrocephaly/autism syndrome, and developmental delay.
- Cardiovascular Diseases: AKT3 has been implicated in the regulation of cardiovascular functions, such as angiogenesis, vascular tone, and cardiac hypertrophy. Dysregulation of AKT3 has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and heart failure.

### Treatment and Prognosis

AKT3 is a potential therapeutic target for various diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Several AKT inhibitors have been developed and tested in clinical trials for cancer treatment, including MK-2206, AZD5363, and ipatasertib. However, the clinical efficacy of AKT inhibitors is limited, and more studies are needed to identify patients who might benefit from AKT inhibitors.

### Drug Response

The response to AKT inhibitors varies among different cancer types and individuals. The efficacy of AKT inhibitors depends on several factors, such as the genetic profile of the tumor, the mode of AKT activation, the feedback loops within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and the presence of other co-mutations. Therefore, the identification of biomarkers that can predict the response to AKT inhibitors is crucial for personalized cancer therapy.
