## Gene CDH1

### Genomic Position
CDH1 is located on the chromosome 16q22.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the CDH1 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). HDGC is characterized by a highly infiltrative and poorly differentiated cancer arising from the stomach's lining.

### Function
CDH1 provides instructions for making a protein called E-cadherin. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cell-to-cell adhesion. The E-cadherin protein serves as a glue that binds epithelial cells together, forming tight junctions that maintain tissue architecture and prevent invasion.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly39Val (rs753849748)
- p.Arg185Trp (rs121913521)
- p.Arg216Trp (rs587782584)

All of the mutations listed above are missense mutations, which constitute a change in the DNA sequence that results in a change in a single amino acid in the encoded protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.707G>A, p.Gly236Arg (rs745840906)
- c.839G>A, p.Arg280His (rs147363443)
- c.229C>T, p.Ala77Val (rs387906688)

### Related Disease
CDH1 mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC).

### Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with a CDH1 mutation are advised to undergo regular monitoring for early detection of the associated cancers and may choose to undergo prophylactic surgery to remove the stomach or breasts.

### Drug Response
There is currently no drug therapy specifically targeting CDH1 mutations.
