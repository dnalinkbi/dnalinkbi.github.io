# Description of Gene SOX21

## Genetic Position
SOX21 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q33.1).

## Pathology 
Mutations in the SOX21 gene have been associated with a variety of diseases including lung adenocarcinoma, Barrett's esophagus, and hypodontia.

## Function 
The SOX21 gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) gene family that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the differentiation and development of various tissues such as the nervous system and the hair follicle stem cells.
