## Gene: INHA
INHA gene encodes for the precursor of the alpha subunit of inhibin, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family. It is mainly produced in the gonads (testes and ovaries), but is also expressed in other tissues such as the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, and placenta.

### Function
Inhibin plays a role in regulating the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. It inhibits the synthesis and secretion of FSH by binding to activin receptors in the pituitary. INHA is involved in the assembly of inhibin A and B subunits, which act as dimers to control the levels of FSH.

### Related Disease
Abnormalities in INHA gene expression have been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and male infertility.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for PCOS, but treatments are available to manage symptoms. Treatment options for male infertility include medication, surgery, and assisted reproductive technology.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to INHA.
