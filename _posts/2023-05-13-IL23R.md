## Information about Gene IL23R

### Genetic Position 
Gene IL23R is located on **chromosome 1p31.3**. It spans **98,994 base pairs** and has **12 exons**.

### Pathology
The variations in the IL23R gene have been studied in several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, spondyloarthropathy, and ankylosing spondylitis. Studies have shown that certain variations in the gene are associated with the risk of developing these diseases.

### Function
The IL23R gene encodes for Interleukin-23 receptor protein, which is involved in the immune system's response to infection and inflammation. It forms a heterodimer with IL12RB1, which, upon binding with IL23, activates the immune cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines.

- p.Gly149Arg (rs11465804)
- p.Pro310Ser (rs76418789)
- p.Val362Ile (rs11465804)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for IL23R gene.

### Related Disease
Variations in the IL23R gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Psoriasis (PSORS7)
- Spondyloarthropathy
- Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of diseases associated with IL23R gene variations depends on the specific disease and its severity. In IBD, medications to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system can be helpful. In psoriasis, topical treatments, light therapy, and systemic medications are used to manage the symptoms.

### Drug Response
Studies have shown that variations in the IL23R gene can affect the response to certain drugs like ustekinumab, which is a monoclonal antibody used to treat psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases.
