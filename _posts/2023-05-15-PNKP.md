# Information about gene PNKP

## Genetic Position
The PNKP gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.33).

## Pathology
Mutations in the PNKP gene are associated with various disorders, including microcephaly with early-onset seizures and developmental delay (MCSZ), ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4 (AOA4), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B2 (CMT2B2).

## Function
The PNKP gene encodes a protein called polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (PNKP), which is involved in DNA repair and maintenance of DNA stability. Specifically, PNKP functions as both a kinase, which adds a phosphate group to DNA, and a phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from DNA. This activity allows PNKP to repair DNA damage caused by radiation, chemicals, and other environmental factors.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms. 

## Drug Response
There is limited information about drug response for mutations in the PNKP gene.

#### Instructions
- AA mutation list can be obtained from dbSNP or any literature sources. Only a few examples are listed here.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels can be obtained from any mutation database. Here, dbSNP is used as an example.
- Related diseases are not limited to what is listed here. They serve as examples of what disorders are linked to the PNKP gene.
- Treatment and prognosis should not be listed if the information is not available.
- Drug response would require additional research and is not readily available for most genes.
