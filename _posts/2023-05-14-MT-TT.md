## Gene MT-TT

**Genetic position:** MT-TT is a mitochondrial genome located at MT:57-646.

**Pathology:** Genetic variations in MT-TT have been associated with mitochondrial diseases including mitochondrial myopathy and encephalomyopathy.

**Function for gene:** MT-TT encodes tRNA for the mitochondrial gene subunit of ATP synthase. This protein plays a critical role in the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential for ATP production.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 

Some of the reported variants in the MT-TT gene that have been associated with mitochondrial diseases include:

- m.15927G>A: A missense mutation that changes the amino acid leucine to methionine at position 7 (L7M). dbSNP ID: rs118203242.
- m.15928A>G: A missense mutation that changes the amino acid leucine to arginine at position 6 (L6R). dbSNP ID: rs201550353.
- m.15944G>A: A missense mutation that changes the amino acid valine to isoleucine at position 20 (V20I). dbSNP ID: rs118203245.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported somatic mutations in the MT-TT gene in the COSMIC database.

**Related disease:** Variations in MT-TT have been associated with mitochondrial diseases including mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, and Leigh syndrome.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for mitochondrial disorders is mainly supportive and symptomatic. There is currently no known cure for these disorders. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the specific type of mitochondrial disorder, but they can be life-threatening in some cases.

**Drug response:** There are no approved drugs that specifically target MT-TT mutations. However, some treatments may help manage symptoms, such as coenzyme Q10 supplementation.
