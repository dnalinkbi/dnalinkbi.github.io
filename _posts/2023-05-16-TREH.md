## Gene: TREH

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11q23.3. 

**Function:** The TREH gene encodes the enzyme trehalase, which is responsible for the breakdown of trehalose into glucose. Trehalose is a disaccharide found in some fungi, insects, and plants that can serve as an energy source.

**Aliases:** Trehalase, EC 3.2.1.28.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 12141
- NCBI Entrez: 6973
- Ensembl: ENSG00000168070
- OMIM: 275355
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43280

**AA Mutation List:**

There are several amino acid mutations identified in the TREH gene. However, no pathogenic mutations are present in the gene as per the ClinVar database. 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

There are a few somatic SNVs/InDels identified in the TREH gene. The notable variants are:

- rs61746434: c.438C>T (p.Ala146Val)
- rs117665780: c.746G>A (p.Gly249Ser)

**Related Diseases:**

The TREH gene is associated with the following diseases:

- Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0 (GSD0)
- Lactose Intolerance

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is no specific treatment for TREH-related diseases. However, the diet modifications help to manage the symptoms.

**Drug Response:**

There is no specific drug available for the treatment of TREH-related diseases.
