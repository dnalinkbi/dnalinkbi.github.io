## Information on Gene PIGL

### Genetic Position
Gene PIGL is located on chromosome 17 at position q23.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the PIGL gene have been linked to developmental disorders such as epilepsy, intellectual disability and hypotonia. These developmental disorders are caused by defects in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis.

### Function
PIGL encodes for an enzyme involved in GPI biosynthesis, a process essential for the function of proteins that are anchored to the cell membrane in eukaryotes.

### External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Locations
- External IDs: HGNC:12969, NCBI Entrez: 94034, Ensembl: ENSG00000141370, OMIM: 610273, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NHL5
- Aliases: FLJ20118, hALG13L, MGC138834, MGC138835, PIG-L, PIG-Lb
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q23.3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations identified in the PIGL gene, which cause glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis defects. Examples include: p.Asp33Gly, p.Gly101Ser, and p.Ser139Pro. These mutations can lead to hypotonia, seizures, and intellectual disability in affected individuals. The dbSNP IDs for these variants are: rs770218277, rs398122501, and rs797045448, respectively.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported in the PIGL gene in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease
Mutations in PIGL are associated with Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation Syndrome 4 (HPMRS4), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual and developmental delays, seizures, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for the developmental disorders associated with PIGL mutations. Treatment is supportive and typically involves a multidisciplinary approach. Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and severity of the disorder.

### Drug Response
There is limited information regarding drug response for individuals with PIGL mutations.
