## Gene KRT3

### Basic Information
- Function: The KRT3 gene encodes for a keratin protein that forms the cytoskeleton of corneal epithelial cells.
- External IDs:
  - Gene ID: 3855
  - Genomic Location: Chromosome 12q13.13
  - Aliases: CK3, K3, K3A
  
### Variations
- AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
    - p.Ala138Thr (rs121908305)
    - p.Gln155* (rs267608162)
    - p.Phe360Ser (rs121908311)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - Not applicable, as KRT3 mutations are primarily germline mutations.
    
### Related Diseases
- Mutations in KRT3 can cause Meesmann Corneal Dystrophy, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cornea.
- Other conditions where KRT3 mutations have been implicated include:
    - Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome
    - Epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy
    
### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for corneal dystrophies caused by KRT3 mutations is often symptomatic and directed towards relieving pain and maintaining vision.
- Corneal transplant may be necessary in some cases.
- Prognosis can be good with proper management, although vision may be compromised in severe cases.
  
### Drug Response
- No drugs are currently approved specifically for KRT3-related corneal dystrophies.
