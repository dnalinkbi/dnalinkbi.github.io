# Gene Information: MCM4

## **Genetic Position**
Chromosome: 8  
Location: 8q11.21  

## **Pathology**
MCM4 gene mutations have been linked to ovarian, bladder, and stomach cancers. The loss of MCM4 slows down DNA replication and increases the chance of genetic alterations that can cause cancer. 

## **Function**
The MCM4 gene encodes a protein that is involved in DNA replication. More specifically, MCM4 is involved in the formation of the Mini Chromosome Maintenance (MCM) complex which plays a crucial role in the initiation of DNA replication.

## **Related Disease**
- Ovarian Cancer - MCM4 mutations have been identified in patients with ovarian cancer.
- Bladder Cancer - Mutations in the MCM4 gene have been associated with increased risk of bladder cancer.
- Stomach Cancer - Studies have reported MCM4 gene alterations in patients with stomach cancer.

## **Treatment and Prognosis**
Currently, there is no specific treatment for MCM4 gene mutations. Treatment options depend on the type and stage of cancer. The prognosis for patients with MCM4 mutations varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## **Drug Response**
There is limited information available on drug response specific to MCM4 gene mutations.
