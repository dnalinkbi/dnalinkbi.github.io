# Information about Gene TNFSF14

## *Gene Position, Pathology, and Function*
TNFSF14, also known as Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14, is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q26.33. It is known to play a role in the immune system by regulating T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Dysregulation of TNFSF14 has been linked to several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer.

## *Function for gene*
TNFSF14 promotes the proliferation of T cells, induces cytokine production, and enhances the activity of natural killer cells.

## *External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases*
- Gene ID: 8740
- Genomic Location: chr3q26.33
- Aliases: LIGHT, CD258, Herpes virus entry mediator ligand, HVEM-L, TNF superfamily member 14, Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14

- c.466G>T: rs200366900
- c.776A>G: rs373318024

## *Related disease*
The dysregulation of TNFSF14 has been linked to several disorders, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer.

## *Treatment and prognosis*
TNFSF14 targeting is an emerging therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases and cancer.

## *Drug response*
Several inhibitors targeting TNFSF14 are being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer.
