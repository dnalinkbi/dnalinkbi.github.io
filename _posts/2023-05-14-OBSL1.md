## Information about Gene OBSL1

### Overview
OBSL1 (obscurin-like 1) is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 2p15.5. It encodes a protein of 843 amino acids which is widely expressed in human tissues and mainly involved in cytoskeleton organization and intracellular signaling. 

### Function
The OBSL1 protein plays an essential role in skeletal muscle function and normal brain development by regulating intracellular signaling pathways and cytoskeleton organization. It maintains myofibril integrity by interacting with multiple cytoskeletal proteins and acts as a scaffold for signaling molecules. OBSL1 also facilitates osteoclast differentiation by promoting the expression of osteoclast-specific genes during bone remodeling. According to the recent studies, loss-of-function mutations in the OBSL1 gene have been associated with various developmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and neuromuscular diseases.
