# Information about Gene SHOX

## Genetic Position
- SHOX gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.33) and Y chromosome (Yp11.3).
  
## Pathology
- SHOX gene abnormalities are associated with short stature disorders, such as Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD), Turner syndrome (TS), and idiopathic short stature (ISS).
- Haploinsufficiency of SHOX gene results in skeletal dysplasia, which is characterized by disproportionate short stature and skeletal abnormalities.

## Function
- SHOX gene plays a crucial role in regulating skeletal growth and development.
- It is involved in the development of cartilage and bone growth plates, which determine the length and shape of bones.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 10867
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 6473
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000147141
- OMIM ID: 312865
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O43623
- Aliases: GCFX, LERI1, LERIW1, SHOXY

## AA Mutation and Type with dbSNP ID
- c.610+6T>C - intronic variant with dbSNP ID: rs9344649
- c.608G>A - missense variant with dbSNP ID: rs9344675, P.Gly203Arg substitution
- c.618C>A - synonymous variant with dbSNP ID: rs9344674, p.Ser206Ser substitution
- c.638C>A - missense variant with dbSNP ID: rs267606843, p.His213Asn substitution

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the SHOX gene.

## Related Diseases
- Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD)
- Turner syndrome (TS)
- Idiopathic short stature (ISS)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment of short stature disorders varies based on the underlying cause.
- Growth hormone therapy is a common treatment option for SHOX gene abnormalities.
- The prognosis for short stature disorders depends on the severity of skeletal dysplasia and underlying medical conditions.

## Drug Response
- Patients with short stature disorders may respond differently to growth hormone therapy, depending on the underlying genetic cause.
