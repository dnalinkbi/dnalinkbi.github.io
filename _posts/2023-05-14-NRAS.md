# Information about gene NRAS

## Genetic Position

The NRAS gene is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p13.2-p13.1.

## Pathology

Variations in the NRAS gene have been associated with the development of several types of cancer, including melanoma, thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer.

## Function for gene

The NRAS gene encodes a protein called NRAS, which is a member of the RAS family of proteins. These proteins play a role in transmitting signals within cells and regulating cell growth and division.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some of the amino acid mutations in the NRAS gene include:

- p.Q61K (rs121913530)
- p.Q61L (rs121913529)
- p.Q61R (rs121913528)
- p.G12D (rs11568821)
- p.G12V (rs121913526)

These mutations are missense mutations, which means that they change the amino acid sequence of the NRAS protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Some somatic SNVs/InDels in the NRAS gene include:

- c.181C>A (rs104894049)
- c.34G>A (rs104894048)
- c.182A>G (rs104894050)

## Related Disease

Variations in the NRAS gene have been associated with several types of cancer, including:

- Melanoma
- Thyroid cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Acute myeloid leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for patients with NRAS mutations depend on the specific type and stage of cancer they have.

## Drug Response

Several drugs that target NRAS mutations are currently in development or undergoing clinical trials.
