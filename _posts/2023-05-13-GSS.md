# Gene GSS

## Genetic Position
The gene GSS is located on chromosome 20 at position 20q11.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GSS gene can cause rare metabolic disorders such as glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSSD) and 5-oxoprolinuria. GSSD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a reduction in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, resulting in hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, and neurological symptoms. 5-oxoprolinuria is also an autosomal recessive disorder, but it is relatively benign and characterized by episodic 5-oxoprolinuria and mild metabolic acidosis.

## Function
The GSS gene encodes the protein glutathione synthetase, which is responsible for catalyzing the final step in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH) from its constituent amino acids. Glutathione is an important antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and is involved in the detoxification of certain compounds.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported in the GSS gene, causing glutathione synthetase deficiency. Some examples include:
- p.Val362Met (rs104894340)
- p.Arg419Pro (rs758230681)
- p.Gly182Asp (rs28940876)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information on somatic mutations in the GSS gene.

## Related Disease
- Glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSSD)
- 5-oxoprolinuria

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for GSSD involves a combination of supportive care and interventions to manage anemia and metabolic acidosis. There is currently no cure for GSSD, and the prognosis is variable, with some individuals experiencing life-threatening complications in early childhood and others having a more mild disease course.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to GSS mutations.
