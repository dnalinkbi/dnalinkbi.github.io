## Gene: CALCRL

### Genetic Position
- The CALCRL gene is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q32.1.

### Pathology
- Mutations in CALCRL have been linked to hypertension, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular diseases.

### Function
- The CALCRL gene codes for a receptor protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor (CTR).
- CTR is primarily expressed in smooth muscle cells and plays a role in regulating blood pressure, vasodilation, and inflammation.

### External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 10201
- Genomic Location: NC_000002.12:g.186913232_186968549del (GRCh38)
- Aliases: CT-R, CRLR, CGRP-R, RDC1, hRDC-1, CRLR1, calcitonin receptor-like receptor
