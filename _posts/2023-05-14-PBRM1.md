# Information about Gene PBRM1 

## Pathology and Function
**PBRM1** (Polybromo 1) is a protein-coding gene that encodes a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which regulates gene expression by altering chromatin structure. It is involved in the process of chromatin remodeling and functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in PBRM1 have been identified in a wide range of cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, and breast cancer.

## Gene ID and Location
The Gene ID for PBRM1 is 55193, and its genomic location is on chromosome 3p21.1. PBRM1 also has several aliases, including PB1, BAF180, and MRT17.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations in PBRM1 that have been identified, including missense mutations, in-frame deletions, and truncations. Some examples include:
- Missense mutation p.Lys482Glu (dbSNP ID: rs150468061)
- In-frame deletion p.Leu784del (dbSNP ID: rs1563226609)
- Truncation mutation p.Trp1105* (dbSNP ID: rs546107253)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and Insertions/Deletions (InDels) have been identified in PBRM1. Some examples include:
- SNV c.1399C>T (dbSNP ID: rs121913986)
- InDel c.3865_3866delAG (dbSNP ID: rs561144449)

## Related Diseases
Mutations in PBRM1 have been associated with a variety of diseases, including:
- Renal Cell Carcinoma
- Bladder Cancer
- Lung Cancer
- Breast Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for PBRM1 mutations depend on the specific disease and the extent of the mutation. However, some studies have shown that PBRM1 mutations may be associated with a better prognosis for patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

## Drug Response
Research is ongoing to determine if PBRM1 mutations can be targeted with specific drug therapies.
