# Information about Gene RNF11

## Gene Position, Pathology and Function
- Gene: RNF11
- Alias: PDZD2, ZNF363, DSCR2, NARF
- Chromosome: 1
- Genomic location: 1p36.33-p36.32
- Pathology: No known pathology
- Function: RNF11 encodes a Ring finger protein 11 which functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. RNF11 promotes ubiquitination of target proteins by bringing the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in close proximity to the substrate. It plays a role in regulating NF-kappa B signaling and the cell cycle.
