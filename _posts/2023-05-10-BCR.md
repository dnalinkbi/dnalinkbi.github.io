## Gene BCR

### Position
The BCR gene is located on chromosome band 22q11.23.

### Pathology
The BCR gene is involved in several types of cancer, including chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and lymphoma.

### Function
The BCR gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, particularly in the development of the immune system.

### Related disease
The BCR gene is associated with several diseases, including:
- Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
- Lymphoma

### Treatment and prognosis
Targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib has revolutionized the treatment and prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with BCR-ABL fusion gene.

### Drug response
Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and BCR-ABL fusion gene have shown to respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib.
