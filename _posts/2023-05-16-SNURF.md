## Gene SNURF

SNURF (Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide F) is a genomic locus that codes for a protein that belongs to the SNRPN (Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N) family. It is located on chromosome 15q11-q13 and has a length of approximately 80 kb. The SNURF gene is alternatively spliced, and its isoforms encode proteins with different roles.

### Function

The SNURF gene has been linked to several important functions in the human body. One of its roles is to regulate gene expression by interacting with other proteins and RNA molecules. It has also been found to play a crucial role in neurodevelopment and maturation.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA (amino acid) mutations identified in the SNURF gene that are associated with disease conditions. Some of the mutations include:

- G263V (dbSNP ID: rs201634388)
- A271T (dbSNP ID: rs201414991)
- Q299R (dbSNP ID: rs201311378)
- E418D (dbSNP ID: rs201986695)

These mutations are mostly missense mutations, where a single nucleotide variation leads to alteration in one amino acid in the protein sequence.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are many somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) identified in the SNURF gene. Some of the identified SNVs and InDels with their respective dbSNP IDs are:

- rs116485780
- rs62046910
- rs759512301
- rs17882807

These somatic mutations play an important role in the development and progression of certain types of cancer.

### Related Disease

Genetic mutations within the SNURF gene have been linked to various disease conditions. Some of the related disorders include:

- Prader-Willi syndrome
- Angelman syndrome
- Autism spectrum disorder

### Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis of individuals affected by SNURF gene mutations depend on the specific disorder they have. For example, there is currently no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome, and treatment focuses on controlling the symptoms associated with the condition. On the other hand, treatment and prognosis for some types of cancer depend on the extent and stage of the disease.

### Drug Response

The drug response for individuals with SNURF gene mutations varies depending on the specific condition and other factors such as the individual's age, general health, and other medications they may be taking. Some drugs may be effective in managing symptoms associated with certain disorders, while others may have adverse effects.
