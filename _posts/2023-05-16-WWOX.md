# Information about Gene WWOX

## Genetic Position
The WWOX gene is located on Chromosome 16 at position q23.3.

## Pathology
The WWOX gene is associated with several pathologies, including cancer development, metabolic disorders, and neurological disorders.

## Function
The WWOX gene encodes a protein, WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, which acts as a tumor suppressor and regulates various cellular processes, including apoptosis, transcription, and DNA repair.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for individuals with WWOX-associated disorders depend on the specific disease. In some cases, surgery or radiation therapy may be necessary for cancer treatment. For neurological disorders, treatment may involve symptom management and supportive therapies.

## Drug response
There is limited information on drug responses related to WWOX gene mutations. However, some studies have suggested that certain gene mutations may affect the response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
