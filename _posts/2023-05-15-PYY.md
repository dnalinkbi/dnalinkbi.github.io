# Gene: PYY

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: q21.1

## Pathology
- PYY (Peptide YY) gene mutations have not been directly linked to any genetic disorder or disease.

## Function for gene
- PYY is a gastrointestinal hormone that inhibits gastric motility and promotes intestinal motility.
- PYY is released from the small intestine and colon in response to food intake and signals satiety to the brain.
