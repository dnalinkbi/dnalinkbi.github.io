## Gene: CCHCR1

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 6
- Genomic Position: 32,724,436-32,737,011 bp
- Strand: -
- Genomic Location: 6p21.3

### Pathology
CCHCR1 gene mutations have been implicated in psoriasis vulgaris, a chronic skin disorder, and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. 

### Function
The CCHCR1 gene encodes for the coiled-coil alpha-helix coiled-coil alpha-helix domain-containing protein 1. The protein's function is not well characterized, but studies suggest that it plays a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation.

### Related Disease
- Psoriasis vulgaris
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for psoriasis vulgaris, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms such as topical and systemic medications, phototherapy, and biologic agents. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is typically treated with immunosuppressive medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antimalarial drugs. The prognosis for both conditions can vary widely depending on severity and the affected individual's response to treatment.

### Drug Response
Studies have suggested a potential association between CCHCR1 genetic variants and the response to specific medications used to treat psoriasis vulgaris, such as methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents.
