# Gene: MMP8

## Genetic Position
MMP8 (Matrix Metallopeptidase 8) is located on chromosome 11q22.3.

## Pathology
MMP8 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix. It plays an important role in tissue remodeling and repair, as well as in inflammation and metastasis. Dysregulation of MMP8 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases.

## Function
MMP8 is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and degradation. It cleaves collagen types I, II, III, VII, and X, elastin, gelatin, and fibronectin. MMP8 is also involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumor development.

## External IDs
- Gene ID: 4317
- Genomic Location: Chr11:102,335,739-102,349,736 
- Aliases: CLG1, HNC, MMP-8, PMNL-CL 

## AA Mutation List
There are a number of AA mutations listed for MMP8 in the NCBI dbSNP database, several of which are associated with cancer. For example, rs11225395 is a missense mutation resulting in a substitution of asparagine for serine at position 478 (S478N).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
Several somatic SNVs (single nucleotide variations) and InDels (insertion/deletion mutations) have been identified in MMP8 through cancer genomic studies, with dbSNP IDs assigned. However, their clinical significance remains to be determined.

## Related Diseases
MMP8 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease. Overexpression of MMP8 has been associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments targeting MMP8. However, its potential involvement in various diseases makes it a possible target for therapeutic development. Its expression levels have been proposed as a prognostic marker in certain cancers.

## Drug Response
There is currently limited information about drug response specifically related to MMP8.
