## Gene Information
**Gene:** EPM2A

**Function for gene:** EPM2A encodes a phosphatase enzyme, laforin, which is involved in glycogen metabolism. Laforin dephosphorylates glycogen, thereby preventing excessive glycogen accumulation in the body.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
- HGNC: 3352
- NCBI Entrez: 7957
- Ensembl: ENSG00000069777
- OMIM: 607566
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NQ66

**Genomic Position:**
- Chromosome: 6
- Location: 6q24.3

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in EPM2A are cataloged in ClinVar database at the moment.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs214333: C>T mutation in the intron region

**Related Disease:**
- Lafora disease

**Treatment and prognosis:**
- Currently, there is no cure for Lafora disease. Treatment options include controlling seizures with antiepileptic medications, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing symptoms with physical therapy. Prognosis is poor, as the disease is generally fatal within 10 years of onset.

**Drug Response:**
- There is no drug treatment specifically targeting EPM2A gene in Lafora disease.
