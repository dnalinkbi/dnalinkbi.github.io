# Gene: TBP

### Information
- **Genetic position:** Chr6:27,272,488-27,276,992
- **Pathology:** TBP gene has been found to be involved in various pathological conditions such as spinocerebellar ataxia, dystonia, and neurodegenerative disorders. 
- **Function:** The TATA-binding protein (TBP) plays a crucial role in the transcription process by binding to the TATA box of a gene promoter. It is necessary for the formation of the pre-initiation complex and the initiation of transcription.
- **Aliases:** TFIID, SCA17, TATA box-binding protein

### Treatment and prognosis
- There is no cure for SCA17, but the symptoms can be managed through medications, speech and physical therapy, and walking aids.
- The prognosis varies depending on the individual and how early the disease is diagnosed.

### Drug response
- The drug Valproic acid has been shown to improve symptoms in some individuals with SCA17.
