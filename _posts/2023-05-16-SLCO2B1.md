# Gene Information for SLCO2B1

SLCO2B1 is a gene that resides on chromosome 11q13.2. It codes for a protein called solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1. This protein is mainly responsible for the transport of prostaglandins in various tissues of the human body and is involved in several metabolic pathways.

## Function for gene

The SLCO2B1 gene codes for a protein that transports prostaglandins and other molecules across cell membranes. Specifically, it is responsible for the transport of prostaglandin E2 in several tissues, including the lungs, kidneys, and intestine. Prostaglandins are essential mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever, and are responsible for many physiological and pathological processes.

## Related disease

Mutations in the SLCO2B1 gene have been linked to several diseases, including:

- Hypertension
- Pre-eclampsia
- Atherosclerosis
- Inflammatory bowel disease

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no known cure for diseases caused by mutations in the SLCO2B1 gene. However, treatments that target prostaglandin signaling pathways may be effective in managing some symptoms. The prognosis of these diseases varies widely depending on the specific condition and its severity.

## Drug response

Several drugs have been shown to interact with the SLCO2B1 transporter, including:

- Methotrexate
- Rifampicin
- Rosuvastatin
- Tenofovir
