## Gene BCKDK

### Genetic Position
The BCKDK gene is located on chromosome 16 at the position 16q12.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the BCKDK gene are associated with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which is an inherited disorder that affects the breakdown of certain amino acids. This results in a buildup of toxic byproducts that can cause neurological problems, developmental delay, and other health issues.

### Function 
The BCKDK gene encodes the branched-chain alpha-keto dehydrogenase kinase, which is an enzyme that regulates the activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. This complex is involved in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including valine, leucine, and isoleucine.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the BCKDK gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the BCKDK gene are associated with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which is an inherited disorder that affects the breakdown of certain amino acids. This results in a buildup of toxic byproducts that can cause neurological problems, developmental delay, and other health issues.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for MSUD typically involves dietary restriction of the branched-chain amino acids. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disease and how early it is diagnosed and treated.

### Drug response
There is currently limited information available regarding drug response for patients with mutations in the BCKDK gene.
