# Information about gene NPC1

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name**: NPC Intracellular Cholesterol Transporter 1 (NPC1)
- **Aliases**: Niemann-Pick C1 protein, NPC1L1 
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 18: 31,134,760-31,359,673 (+ strand)

## Function for gene
The gene NPC1 encodes a protein that functions as an intracellular transporter of cholesterol and other lipids. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of cholesterol in the body through its involvement in intracellular lipid trafficking.

## External IDs and External Sites 
- **HGNC**: HGNC:7685 
- **NCBI Entrez**:  NPC1
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000060971
- **OMIM**: 607623
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: O15118

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- **Mutation type**: Missense, splicing, nonsense, frameshift, deletion, duplication
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs1805081, rs1805082, rs1805084, rs1805085, rs137852769

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels with reported dbSNP IDs

## Related Disease
Mutations in the NPC1 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC).

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for NPC. However, treatments such as miglustat have been shown to delay the progression of symptoms in some cases.

## Drug Response
Miglustat, a substrate reduction therapy drug that decreases sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipid synthesis, has been shown to be effective in treating NPC.
