# Information about gene CDH17

## Genetic Position
The gene CDH17 is located on the chromosome 8 at the position 8q22.2.

## Pathology and Function
The CDH17 gene codes for the Cadherin-17 protein, which is a member of the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules. Cadherin-17 is primarily expressed in the liver and also in the stomach, pancreas, bile duct, and intestine. This protein plays a crucial role in tissue morphogenesis and development. Some studies suggest that CDH17 may be involved in tumor development, invasion, and metastasis.

## Related Disease
Research suggests that CDH17 plays a significant role in the development and progression of several diseases, including:

- Liver Cancer
- Pancreatic Cancer
- Gastric Cancer
- Biliary Tract Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no targeted therapy available for CDH17-related cancers. However, several studies suggest that CDH17 may serve as a potential prognostic marker for the progression and metastasis of liver and pancreatic cancer.

## Drug Response
Research is ongoing to identify therapeutic targets for CDH17-related cancers and to develop targeted therapies that help inhibit the function of this protein.
