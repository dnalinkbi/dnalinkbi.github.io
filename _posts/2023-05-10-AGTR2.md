## Gene: AGTR2

- **Function:** The AGTR2 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    * HGNC ID: 333
    * NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 186
    * Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000105835
    * Genomic Location: Chromosome Xq22.1

- **Aliases:** AT2, ATGR2

- **AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:**
    * p.L104H - missense mutation - rs140354541
    * p.A175V - missense mutation - rs749188764
    * p.T190M - missense mutation - rs45516033

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    * c.607C>T - missense mutation - rs147077610
    * c.875G>A - missense mutation - rs55900034

- **Related Diseases:**
    * Hypertension
    * Cardiac hypertrophy
    * Diabetes mellitus
    * Cancer

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    There is currently no specific treatment for AGTR2-related disorders. Prognosis depends on the severity of the associated disease.

- **Drug Response:**
    Studies have shown that AGTR2 is involved in the response to certain cardiovascular drugs, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors.
