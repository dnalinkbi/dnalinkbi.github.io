## Information about gene LRPPRC

**Genetic position:** The LRPPRC gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2p21.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the LRPPRC gene have been associated with French-Canadian Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

**Function:** The LRPPRC gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Not available.

**Related disease:** French-Canadian Leigh syndrome

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no known cure for French-Canadian Leigh syndrome and treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis is poor and often leads to death within a few years of onset.

**Drug response:** Not available.
