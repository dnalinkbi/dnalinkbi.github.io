Related diseases: Congenital disorder of glycosylation 2k (CDG2K)

Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no cure for CDG2K. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, which means that the symptoms are treated as they appear.

Drug response: There is no drug that is specific for CDG2K. However, certain drugs can be used to manage the symptoms of the disease.
