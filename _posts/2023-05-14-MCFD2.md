## Gene: MCFD2 

### Information

- **Position**: Chromosome 2 (2q33.2)
- **Pathology**: There is limited information on the pathology of MCFD2 gene mutation. 
- **Function**: MCFD2 plays a crucial role in Vitamin K-dependent protein maturation by forming a complex with LMAN1 which is associated with the anterograde transport of the proteins.
- **Aliases**: MCFD2L, MIDED, MDP, VRD
