## Gene FMO4

### Genetic Position
The FMO4 gene is located on chromosome 1q23.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the FMO4 gene have been associated with trimethylaminuria, which is a metabolic disorder that results in a fishy odor in the breath and body secretions.

### Function
The FMO4 gene encodes for the protein flavin-containing monooxygenase 4, which is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. 

### External IDs and Aliases

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Val155Met (rs61743763)
- His320Tyr (rs61747994)
- Leu344Phe (rs61750304)

All of the above mutations are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the FMO4 gene.

### Related Disease
Trimethylaminuria, also known as fish odor syndrome, is associated with mutations in the FMO4 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Trimethylaminuria is a chronic condition and there is no known cure for it. However, symptoms can be managed by reducing the intake of foods that contain precursors to trimethylamine, such as fish and eggs.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with mutations in the FMO4 gene.
