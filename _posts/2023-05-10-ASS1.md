# Gene: ASS1

## Gene Function
ASS1 (Argininosuccinate Synthase 1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate. It is a key enzyme involved in the urea cycle, which is responsible for the detoxification of ammonia in the liver. ASS1 is also involved in the biosynthesis of nitric oxide, proline, and glutamate.

## Related Disease
ASS1 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that leads to hyperammonemia and cognitive impairment. It has also been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for ASS1 deficiency involves dietary interventions, such as the restriction of protein and the supplementation of arginine. In some cases, liver transplantation may be necessary. 

The prognosis for ASS1 deficiency varies widely, but with early diagnosis and treatment, many individuals can lead a normal life. 

## Drug Response
Some studies suggest that ASS1 may be a predictive biomarker for the response to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as arginine-depleting agents.
