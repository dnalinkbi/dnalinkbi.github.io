## Gene Information
- **Gene symbol:** NME8
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 17q21.2
- **Aliases:** NDK8, NM23-H8, NME/NM23 family member 8

## Function
NME8 is a member of the NME/NM23 gene family that encodes nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), which is involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. Studies indicate that NME8 may have a role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in carcinogenesis.
