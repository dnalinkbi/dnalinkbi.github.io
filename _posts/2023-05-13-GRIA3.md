# Information about gene GRIA3

## Genetic Position
GRIA3 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p34.3.

## Pathology
GRIA3 gene is associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and intellectual disability.

## Function
GRIA3 gene encodes Glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 3 protein which plays an important role in the synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes.
