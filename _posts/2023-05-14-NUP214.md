# Gene: NUP214
---

## Genetic Position
The NUP214 gene is located on chromosome 9q34.11.

## Pathology
Abnormalities in the NUP214 gene have been associated with various types of cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and various solid tumors.

## Function
The NUP214 gene encodes for a nuclear pore complex protein that plays a critical role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, RNA transport, and mitosis.
