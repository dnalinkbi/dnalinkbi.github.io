## Gene SETBP1

### Genetic Position and Function
Gene: SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1) is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 18. It spans a length of 381,141 base pairs and has 8 exons. The protein encoded by this gene is a SET domain-containing protein that is involved in the regulation of gene expression.
