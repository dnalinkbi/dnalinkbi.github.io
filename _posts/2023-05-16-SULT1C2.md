# Gene Information for SULT1C2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- SULT1C2 is located on chromosome 22q13.33.
- This gene encodes a sulfotransferase enzyme, which catalyzes the transfer of a sulfonate group from a donor molecule to a substrate. 
- The function of SULT1C2 is to participate in the detoxification and metabolism of various xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous compounds. 

## Gene Function
- SULT1C2 participates in the metabolism of drugs, hormones, and other xenobiotics that are substrates for sulfonation.
