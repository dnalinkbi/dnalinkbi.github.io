# Information about gene PTGDR

## Genetic Position
PTGDR is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 14 (14q22.1).

## Pathology
PTGDR is associated with asthma and allergic diseases. Studies have shown that individuals with variations in the PTGDR gene have an increased risk of developing asthma and other allergic diseases.

## Function
PTGDR encodes the prostanoid DP receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to prostaglandins and plays a role in inflammatory responses.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 9600
- NCBI Entrez ID: 5730
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000100879
- OMIM ID: 601414
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P43116
- Aliases: CRTH2, GPR44

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations associated with the PTGDR gene. Here are four examples:
- Val158Ile: rs192999055
- Gly11Asp: rs755442126
- Glu298Lys: rs562364444
- Arg79Cys: rs140200865

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the PTGDR gene. Here are three examples:
- rs368590564
- rs578123088
- rs863224691

## Related Disease
Variations in the PTGDR gene have been associated with asthma and allergic diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no treatments specifically targeting PTGDR for asthma or allergic diseases. However, medications that target the prostaglandin pathway may be effective in reducing inflammation associated with these conditions.

## Drug Response
Variations in the PTGDR gene may impact an individual's response to medications targeting the prostaglandin pathway. For example, individuals with PTGDR variations may have a different response to prostaglandin inhibitors such as aspirin.
