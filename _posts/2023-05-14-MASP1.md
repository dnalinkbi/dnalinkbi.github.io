### Gene: MASP1

- **Function for gene**: 
MASP1 (mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1) encodes a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the complement system. It is involved in the activation of the lectin pathway of complement activation by cleaving complement factors C4 and C2. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: 
  - HGNC: 6912
  - NCBI Entrez Gene: 5649
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000121691
  - OMIM: 600521
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P48740
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 3q27.3

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
There are several AA (amino acid) mutations reported in MASP1 gene in the dbSNP database. Some of them are: 
  - rs4549 (p.Asp120Asn)
  - rs7073 (p.Thr500Ala)
  - rs199913158 (p.Asp544Gly)
  - rs55801134 (p.Ala569Val)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported in the dbSNP database for the MASP1 gene.

- **Related disease**: 
MASP1 gene mutations have been associated with disorders of the complement system such as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Some of the related diseases are: 
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

- **Treatment and prognosis**:
There are no specific treatments available for MASP1 gene mutations. Treatment options usually focus on managing the symptoms associated with complement-associated diseases. Prognosis depends on the severity and progression of the disease.

- **Drug response**:
There are no known drugs targeting MASP1 gene mutations. However, various drugs have been used to manage complement-associated diseases. For example, eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits complement protein C5 and is approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).
