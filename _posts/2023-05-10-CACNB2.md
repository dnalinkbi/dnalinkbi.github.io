# Gene information for CACNB2

## 1. Genetic position, pathology, and function

Gene CACNB2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q25.3). It is a member of the voltage-dependent calcium channel beta subunit family, which plays an essential role in calcium ion influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. Importantly, CACNB2 modulates the activation and inactivation kinetics of the alpha-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, ultimately influencing neuronal excitability.

## 2. Gene function

The primary function of the CACNB2 gene is to provide instructions for producing the beta-2 subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel. This subunit helps regulate the function of the calcium channel, which in turn modulates muscle, heart, and brain activity.

## 6. Related disease

Mutations or abnormalities in the CACNB2 gene have been found to be associated with several disorders, including epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Additionally, some studies have suggested that variants in CACNB2 may influence the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

## 7. Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment available for CACNB2-related disorders. However, some treatments can alleviate symptoms, such as antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy or antipsychotics for schizophrenia. The prognosis for individuals with CACNB2 mutations or disorders varies depending on the specific condition and severity.

## 8. Drug response

There is limited information available regarding drug response and CACNB2 mutations or disorders. Some studies have suggested that variants in CACNB2 may influence the response to certain antiepileptic drugs or antipsychotics.
