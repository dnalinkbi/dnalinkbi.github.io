# Gene: MURC
## Genetic Position

MURC (muscle-related coiled-coil protein) is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q42.13.

## Pathology and Function

MURC is a protein-coding gene that is involved in the regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle differentiation and hypertrophy. It is also known to be involved in the maintenance of cardiac function. There is evidence to suggest that MURC could play a role in the pathology of heart failure, although further research is required to establish a definitive link.
