# Gene: USP6

## **Location**
* Chromosome: 17
* Genomic Position: 57,091,711-57,101,227
* Strand: Plus strand

## **Pathology**
USP6 gene mutations are associated with disorders like aneurysmal bone cyst and nodular fasciitis.

## **Function**
The USP6 gene encodes for ubiquitin-specific protease 6. It acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme, mainly deubiquitinates TAK1, TAK1-binding protein TAB1 and TAB2 hence plays role in regulating the TNF-alpha signaling pathway, cell growth, and differentiation.

* Ensembl: ENSG00000122735
* OMIM: 602520
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y4P1
* Aliases: TRE2, TRE17, TUBA

## **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**
* p.Gln930Ter (rs778294975)
* p.N1050fs (rs80236021)

## **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
* c.41G>A (rs368543617)
* c.592G>A (rs139523783)
* c.562C>T (rs886037058)

## **Related Disease**
* Aneurysmal bone cyst
* Nodular fasciitis

## **Treatment and Prognosis**
Aneurysmal bone cyst may require surgical intervention but has a good prognosis. Nodular fasciitis is usually self-limiting, resolves on its own but may need surgical removal in some cases.

## **Drug Response**
There are no specific drugs or targeted molecular therapies that are approved to treat the disorders associated with USP6 gene mutations.
