## Gene MT-TE

### Genetic Position
MT-TE is located on the Mitochondrial Genome at the position 16,196-16,578.

### Pathology
Mutations in the MT-TE gene have been associated with various mitochondrial diseases, including Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON).

### Function
The MT-TE gene encodes for tRNA-Glutamic acid, which is involved in the mitochondrial translation process by carrying amino acids to the mitochondrial ribosome and assisting in the assembly of proteins.

- m.14693T>C (p.Leu22Pro) rs118204601
- m.14674T>C (p.Leu16Pro) rs118204602
- m.14694T>C (p.Leu22Pro) rs118204603

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the MT-TE gene.

### Related Disease
- Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for LHON, and treatment is limited to supportive measures. Some patients may experience spontaneous recovery or partial recovery of vision.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug available for the treatment of LHON.
