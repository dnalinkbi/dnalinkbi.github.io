# Information about Gene GSR

## Genomic Location 
Gene: GSR (Glutathione-disulfide Reductase), located on chromosome 8q21.13 

## Pathology 
GSR plays a key role in the reduction of glutathione-disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form GSH, which is necessary for the prevention of oxidative stress. Mutations in GSR can lead to an accumulation of GSSG and a decrease in GSH levels, leading to oxidative stress and possible pathological conditions. 

## Function 
The main function of GSR is the reduction of GSSG. Thereby a deficiency in GSR enzymatic activity can lead to multiple disorders, such as hemolytic anemia and metabolic diseases.
