## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported for the FUZ gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related disease
Mutations in the FUZ gene have been associated with neural tube defects, including spina bifida and craniorachischisis.

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for neural tube defects typically involves surgical intervention and ongoing supportive care. The prognosis can vary widely depending on the severity of the defect.

## Drug response
There is no known drug specifically targeting the FUZ gene.
