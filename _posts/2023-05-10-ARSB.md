# Information about gene ARSB

## Genetic position
The ARSB gene is located on chromosome 5q14.1.

## Pathology
The ARSB gene encodes for the enzyme arylsulfatase B, which is responsible for breaking down sulfate-containing molecules. Mutations in this gene lead to the accumulation of these molecules and cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI).

## Function for gene
The ARSB gene encodes for the arylsulfatase B enzyme, which breaks down sulfate-containing molecules.

- p.Asp90Asn - Missense - rs121908665
- p.Pro223Leu - Missense - rs121908666

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the ARSB gene.

## Related disease
Mutations in the ARSB gene cause mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI).

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for MPS VI typically includes enzyme replacement therapy and supportive care. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug response
Enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to be effective in treating MPS VI.
