## Information about gene DPYD

DPYD is a gene that provides instructions to produce an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. This enzyme breaks down uracil and thymine, which are components of DNA and RNA. DPYD is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p22.1. 

### Function for gene

The DPYD gene provides instructions for creating the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme. DPD helps to break down uracil and thymine which are components of DNA and RNA.

|c.1905+1G>A|rs75017182|

### Related disease

DPYD gene variations are associated with increased risk for toxicity associated with certain anti-cancer drugs, particularly 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine. Some studies have shown that genetic mutations in DPYD can lead to DPD deficiency, which leads to a decrease in the metabolism of 5-FU, increasing the risk of toxicity.

### Treatment and prognosis

Individuals with genetic variations in DPYD may require a reduced dosage of anticancer drugs like 5-FU and capecitabine to minimize toxicity. Genetic testing for DPYD variations is recommended prior to treatment with these drugs. 

### Drug response

Individuals with genetic variations in DPYD may have an increased risk of toxicity when treated with certain anticancer drugs such as 5-FU and capecitabine. DPD deficiency caused by DPYD mutations can lead to an accumulation of these drugs, which can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased white blood cell counts.
