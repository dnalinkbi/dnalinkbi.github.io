### Gene: PROCR

#### Function
PROCR, also known as endothelial protein C receptor, is a glycosylated transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating blood coagulation and inflammation. It acts as a cofactor for protein C activation, which in turn inhibits blood clot formation and promotes fibrinolysis. PROCR also has anti-inflammatory properties and regulates vascular permeability.

#### Related Disease
PROCR mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including thrombophilia, sepsis, and cardiovascular diseases.

#### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for PROCR-related diseases vary depending on the specific condition. In thrombophilia, anticoagulants may be used to prevent blood clot formation. In sepsis, early diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

#### Drug Response
Research suggests that anticoagulants like heparin and warfarin may be effective in treating PROCR-related thrombophilia. However, more studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment approach.
