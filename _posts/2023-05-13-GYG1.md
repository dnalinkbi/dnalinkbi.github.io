## Gene Information
The gene GYG1 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 3q24.3. It encodes the glycogenin-1 protein, which plays a key role in glycogen synthesis. 

## Function
Glycogenin-1 is a self-glucosylating protein that catalyzes the initial step in glycogen synthesis. It produces an oligosaccharide primer that is extended by glycogen synthase to form a glycogen particle.
