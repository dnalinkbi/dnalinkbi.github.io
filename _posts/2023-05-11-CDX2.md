## Information about Gene CDX2

### Genetic Position
CDX2 gene is located on chromosome 13q12.3. The genomic position of the gene is from 27,965,383 to 27,993,814.

### Pathology
CDX2 is involved in intestinal development and differentiation. Abnormalities in CDX2 expression have been linked to colorectal cancer.

### Function for Gene
CDX2 gene codes for a transcription factor that binds to the promoter regions of target genes involved in gut development and differentiation.

### Related Disease
CDX2 is involved in colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and several other cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis
CDX2 expression can be used to predict the survival of patients with colorectal cancer. High levels of CDX2 expression have been linked to better prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available about the drug response of CDX2 as a therapeutic target in cancer.
