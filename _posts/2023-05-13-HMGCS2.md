# Gene: HMGCS2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p36.22
- Strand: Plus (+) Strand

## Pathology and Function
- HMGCS2 encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, an enzyme involved in ketogenesis. Ketogenesis is the metabolic process by which ketone bodies are produced as a source of energy during fasting or low-carbohydrate diets.
