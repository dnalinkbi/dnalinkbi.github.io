# Information about Gene TMC8

## Genetic Position
- Gene name: TMC8 (Transmembrane Channel-Like 8)
- Chromosome: X
- Start position: 73,566,754 bp
- End position: 73,617,691 bp

## Pathology and Function
- TMC8 gene is associated with Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV)
- It is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin's ability to fight off certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV).
- TMC8 gene encodes transmembrane channel-like 8 protein which is responsible for the recognition and clearance of HPV from the skin.
- Mutations in TMC8 gene can result in functional impairment of the protein, leading to persistent HPV infection, the development of skin lesions, and an increased risk of skin cancer.

## Related Disease
- Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure or FDA-approved treatment for Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis.
- Treatment options include surgical removal of skin lesions, topical treatments, and antiviral medications.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the immune system's response to HPV infection.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information on drug response in Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis.
- Some studies suggest that Imiquimod cream, an immune response modifier, may be effective in treating skin lesions caused by HPV in EV patients.
