# Gene PSEN1

## Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 14q24.2
- **Pathology:** Mutations in PSEN1 are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), an early onset form of the disease.
- **Function for gene:** PSEN1 encodes Presenilin 1, which is a subunit of the gamma-secretase complex. This complex is involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to form amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptides, which accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

## External IDs and Aliases 

- **HGNC:** 9508
- **NCBI Entrez:** 5663
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000142192
- **OMIM:** 104311
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P49768
- **Aliases:** AD3, PS1, PSNL1

## Mutation Information

- **AA mutation list:** There are numerous mutations in the PSEN1 gene associated with FAD, some of the most common include: A79V, P117L, E120G, H163R, M146V, H163Y, G206A, A246E, and L282V. 
- **Mutation type:** Missense, Nonsense, Frameshift, Splice site, and Insertion/Deletion
- **dbSNP ID:** rs63750219, rs63749855, rs63750522, rs1061470, rs63751104, rs63751242 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- There are no recorded Somatic SNVs/InDels in the PSEN1 gene.

## Related Diseases

- Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no known cure for Familial Alzheimer's Disease, but patients may be treated with medications that help manage the symptoms of the disease, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.
- Prognosis for patients with FAD is poor, as the disease is progressive and ultimately fatal.

## Drug Response

- There is no known specific drug response associated with mutations in the PSEN1 gene.
