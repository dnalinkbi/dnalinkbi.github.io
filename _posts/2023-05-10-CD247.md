# Gene CD247

## Gene Information
- **Function:** The CD247 gene encodes a protein called CD3 zeta chain, which is one component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. This complex is involved in the recognition of an antigen when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. CD3 zeta chain is an important signaling molecule for T cell activation and plays a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of T cells.
- **Aliases:** T3Z, CD3Z
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 1703 
    - NCBI Entrez: 919
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000198981
    - OMIM: 186780
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P20963 

## Genetic Position
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 1 (1q21.3)
- **Exons:** The CD247 gene has 5 exons and spans about 10 kb of genomic DNA.

## Mutations
- **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):** Several SNPs have been reported in the CD247 gene, some of which are associated with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The dbSNP IDs for some of these SNPs are: rs11552708, rs11556419, rs3898999, rs7571379.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** Somatic mutations in the CD247 gene have been reported in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma. The dbSNP IDs for some of these mutations are: rs785202159, rs372798747, rs138372693.

## Related Diseases
- **Autoimmune diseases:** CD247 gene mutations have been associated with several autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
- **Cancer:** Somatic mutations in the CD247 gene have been reported in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for CD247 gene mutations. Treatment options for autoimmune diseases associated with CD247 mutations include immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. For cancers with CD247 mutations, treatment options depend on the type and stage of cancer.
- The prognosis for patients with CD247 gene mutations depends on the type and severity of the associated disease.

## Drug Response
- There is no information available on drug response specific to CD247 gene mutations.
