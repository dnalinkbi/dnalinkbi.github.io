## Gene NDN

### Genetic Position
Gene NDN (necdin) is located on the short arm of chromosome 15 (15q11.2-q12).

### Pathology
The loss of function or mutations in the NDN gene are associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic disorder that causes a wide range of physical, mental, and behavioral problems.

### Function
The NDN gene encodes a protein called necdin, which is involved in the development and maintenance of nerve cells in the brain.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7673
- NCBI Entrez: 4692
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169458
- OMIM: 602117
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O14578

Aliases: 
- Prader-Willi syndrome region candidate 1 protein
- PWS-regulated gene 1 protein
- Protein ND

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations and associated dbSNP IDs in the NDN gene, including:
- p.Thr29Ser (rs104894087)
- p.Gly56Arg (rs104894086)
- p.Thr142Ala (rs2395182)
- p.Ala180Thr (rs104894085)

All of these mutations are classified as benign or likely benign by ClinVar.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the NDN gene with dbSNP IDs.

### Related Disease
The NDN gene is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which is characterized by obesity, intellectual disability, and short stature. Other features of PWS can include hypotonia, poor feeding, behavioral problems, and sleep abnormalities.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for PWS, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and improving quality of life. This may include growth hormone therapy, special education, and behavioral therapy.

### Drug Response
There are no known drugs that specifically target the NDN gene or necdin protein.
