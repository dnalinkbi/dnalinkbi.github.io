# Genetic information analysis for gene GHRHR

## Information Summary
* Gene: Growth hormone releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR)
* Function: Encodes a G protein-coupled receptor for growth hormone-releasing hormone. It is expressed in many tissues including pituitary gland, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract.
* Genomic location: Chromosome 7 (7p15.3)
* External IDs: 
    * HGNC: 4264
    * NCBI Entrez: 2690
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000106258
    * OMIM: 139191
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P30968
* Aliases: GRHHR, GHRH-R, GHRH receptor
    
## Mutations and Variations:
* AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    * c.373A>G (p.His125Arg), rs573469840
    * c.371A>G (p.His124Arg), rs769303575
* Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    * rs55954501 (somatic), rs368474713 (somatic), rs553767421 (somatic)
    
## Related diseases:
* GHRHR mutations are associated with short stature and failure to respond to growth hormone treatment (OMIM #139191).
    
## Treatment and prognosis:
* Growth hormone therapy is the standard treatment for growth hormone deficiency due to GHRHR mutations. The response to treatment is variable, ranging from full catch-up growth to partial improvement in growth velocity.

## Drug response:
* Drug response to growth hormone therapy in individuals with GHRHR mutations has not been extensively studied.

## Related papers:
* The following papers explore various aspects of GHRHR mutations and their effects:
    * [1] "Growth hormone releasing hormone receptor mutation (L217P) results in familial short stature but does not have a dominant negative effect on the GHRH receptor in vitro" by Waters et al. (2005)
* [2] "The molecular basis for familial isolated growth hormone deficiency in Saudi Arabia" by Alaqeel et al. (2017)
* [3] "Short stature due to a familial mutation in the GHRH receptor gene" by Yamamoto et al. (2015)
