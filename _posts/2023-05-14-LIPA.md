## Gene: LIPA
- **Function for gene:** 
The LIPA gene encodes for Lysosomal acid lipase enzyme, which is essential for the breakdown of cholesterol in cells. This gene is involved in the metabolism of lipids, particularly cholesterol esters and triglycerides.

- **Related disease:** 
Variants in LIPA gene have been associated with:
    - Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD)
    - Wolman disease
    - Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy

- **Treatment and prognosis:** 
There is no cure for CESD and Wolman disease. The treatment of patients with CESD and Wolman disease is usually symptomatic and supportive.
