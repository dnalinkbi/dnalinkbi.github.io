# Gene: PSPH

- **Function:** PSPH (Phosphoserine phosphatase) plays a crucial role in the L-serine biosynthesis pathway by converting 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to L-serine. It is essential for brain development and function, as well as for folate metabolism and DNA synthesis.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 5727
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 7q11.23
    - Aliases: PSP, SDR27C1
