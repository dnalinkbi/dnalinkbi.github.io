# Gene PTH

## Genetic Position
The PTH gene is located on chromosome 11 in humans. Its specific genomic location is 11p15.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PTH gene have been associated with familial isolated hypoparathyroidism, a rare disorder characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone, low levels of calcium in the blood, and other related symptoms.

## Function
The PTH gene provides instructions for the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that helps regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the body. PTH accomplishes this by increasing the release of calcium from bones and increasing the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. It also reduces the reabsorption of phosphate in the kidneys.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known single amino acid mutations in the PTH gene, including:
- R15L (rs121912931)
- R18W (rs121912932)
- D22G (rs121912933)
- V49E (rs199779158)

These mutations are missense mutations, which means they result in a single amino acid change in the PTH protein sequence.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
The dbSNP database lists several somatic mutations in the PTH gene, including:
- rs139306814
- rs145281685
- rs139447350
- rs144896373

## Related Disease
As mentioned earlier, mutations in the PTH gene have been linked to familial isolated hypoparathyroidism, a rare inherited disorder. This condition can cause low levels of calcium in the blood, as well as muscle cramps, seizures, and other related symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for hypoparathyroidism typically involves increasing calcium levels in the blood through oral supplements or injections. Prognosis for those with familial isolated hypoparathyroidism is generally good with appropriate treatment.

## Drug Response
There are several drugs that can be used to treat hypoparathyroidism, including calcium supplements, vitamin D supplements, and recombinant PTH.
