## Information about gene SERPINA3

- **Genetic Position:** SERPINA3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at position 14q32.1-q32.13.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in SERPINA3 have been associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

- **Function:** SERPINA3 encodes a member of the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors. It has been shown to inhibit the activity of a variety of serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and thrombin.
