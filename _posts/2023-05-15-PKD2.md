# Gene Information

## Gene: PKD2

### Function
The PKD2 gene encodes for a protein called polycystin-2, which forms ion channels involved in cellular calcium signaling.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 8983
- NCBI Entrez: 5311
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109755
- OMIM: 173910
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13563
- Genomic location: Chromosome 4q22

### Aliases
- TRPP2
- MGC14216

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- R373W (missense) - rs113420316
- L703P (missense) - rs121918111
- P635L (missense) - rs113420317
- A514V (missense) - rs137853430

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- C > T at position 617 (missense) - rs1553777637

### Related Disease
Mutations in PKD2 have been linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for ADPKD, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

### Drug Response
There are a few drugs currently being studied for the treatment of ADPKD, including tolvaptan and octreotide. These drugs aim to slow cyst growth and preserve kidney function.
