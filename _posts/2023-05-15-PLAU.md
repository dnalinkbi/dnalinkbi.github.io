# Information about gene PLAU

## Genetic Position
- The gene PLAU is located on chromosome 10q22.1.
- The gene spans 16.27 kb in length.

## Pathology
- The PLAU gene is associated with various pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammation.

## Function for gene
- The PLAU gene encodes for the enzyme urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which plays a key role in the regulation of fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix remodeling.
- The uPA protein is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such as wound healing, tumor invasion, and metastasis.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 8728
- Entrez Gene: 5328
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000108654
- OMIM ID: 191840
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q03405
- Aliases: ATF, QPD, UPAR, URK

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are various mutations reported for the PLAU gene in the NCBI dbSNP database.
- Some of the mutations include missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and splicing mutations.
- One example of a missense mutation is rs2227564, which causes an amino acid change from valine to alanine at position 53 (V53A).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the PLAU gene in the NCBI dbSNP and COSMIC databases.
- Some of the somatic mutations are associated with various cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
- One example of a somatic mutation is rs886205614, which is a missense mutation that causes a change from cysteine to tryptophan at position 18 (C18W).

## Related Disease
- The PLAU gene is associated with various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease.
- PLAU gene expression has been found to be upregulated in many types of cancers, and this upregulation is associated with tumor growth and metastasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Targeting the uPA/uPAR system has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.
- Levels of uPA expression have been found to be an important prognostic factor in many types of cancer.

## Drug Response
- Several uPA inhibitors have been developed as potential anti-cancer drugs.
- One example of a uPA inhibitor is Uk-383,367, which has been found to inhibit uPA activation and suppress tumor growth in preclinical studies.
