## Information about gene MATR3

### Genetic position
- The gene MATR3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31.2)

### Pathology
- Mutations in the MATR3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), distal myopathy with vocal cord weakness, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.

### Function for gene
- The MATR3 gene encodes for the Matrin-3 protein, which is involved in DNA transcription, mRNA processing, and mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6941
- NCBI Entrez: 9782
- Ensembl: ENSG00000165655
- OMIM: 164015
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P43243
- Aliases: VCP-interacting membrane protein, Matrin 3, Matrin-3, MATRIN3

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.S85C (rs369980353) is a missense mutation in the MATR3 gene that has been associated with ALS
- p.P154S (rs201474368) is another missense mutation that has been linked to both ALS and distal myopathy with vocal cord weakness
- p.V358A (rs765296538) is a third missense mutation that is associated with ALS

### somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no known somatic mutations in the MATR3 gene at this time.

### Related disease
- Mutations in the MATR3 gene have been linked to several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), distal myopathy with vocal cord weakness, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.

### Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment for diseases associated with the MATR3 gene mutations is primarily supportive and symptom-based.
- Prognosis varies depending on the disease and severity of the mutation.

### Drug response
- There is limited information on drug response and effectiveness for diseases associated with MATR3 mutations.
