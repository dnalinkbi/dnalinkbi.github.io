# Information about Gene ELP4

## Genetic Position
ELP4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q13.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ELP4 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay and intellectual disability, as well as distal arthrogryposis and some forms of epilepsy. 

## Function
The ELP4 gene encodes the Elongator complex protein 4, which has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including transcription elongation, tRNA modification, and neurite outgrowth.
