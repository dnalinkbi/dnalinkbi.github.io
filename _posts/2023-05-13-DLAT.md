## Gene DLAT

- **Function:** The DLAT gene provides instructions for making the enzyme dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase that plays a crucial role in cellular energy production by catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl group from pyruvate to coenzyme A, leading to the formation of acetyl CoA. This is the initial step for the Krebs cycle (also called citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), a central energy-yielding pathway in aerobic organisms. 

- **External IDs:** Gene ID: 1737, Genomic location: Chromosome 11q13.1, Aliases: DLTA, E2K, E2KCT, LAT.

- **External sites:** [HGNC] ([Click](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:2965),) [NCBI Entrez] ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1737),) [Ensembl] ([Click](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000110395),) [OMIM] ([Click](https://www.omim.org/entry/608771),) [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot] ([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10515).)

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Several variants in the DLAT gene have been reported, some of which are associated with diseases. For instance, p.Glu126Lys (rs113994102) and p.Cys194Tyr (rs121917825) are both missense mutations that have been linked to maple syrup urine disease 2A (MSUD2A), a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of certain amino acids. Another missense mutation, p.Ile404Met (rs730880991), has been associated with combined D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D/L-2-HGAuria), an inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No somatic mutations for DLAT are currently reported in dbSNP.

- **Related disease:** In addition to MSUD2A and D/L-2-HGAuria, DLAT has been associated with other metabolic disorders such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDHC deficiency), a rare X-linked disorder that impairs energy-generating processes in cells, and Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial genes responsible for oxidative phosphorylation.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for metabolic disorders associated with DLAT mutations may involve a protein-restricted diet, supplementation with special formulas, and in some cases, liver transplantation. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease, but early diagnosis and proper management can improve outcomes.

- **Drug response:** No drug response information is currently available for DLAT.
