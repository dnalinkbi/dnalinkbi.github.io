# Information about Gene NME5

## Gene Position
The NME5 gene is located on chromosome 17 at position q21.33.

## Gene Function
The NME5 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called nucleoside diphosphate kinase 5 (NDPK5). This protein plays a role in regulating the production of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA and RNA. It is also involved in cell signaling and cell motility.
