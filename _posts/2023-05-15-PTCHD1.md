# Gene PTCHD1 Information

## Genetic Position

The PTCHD1 gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp22.11-p22.12. It spans 144,267 base pairs and contains 25 exons.

## Pathology

PTCHD1 is associated with several neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. PTCHD1 mutations have been identified in patients with these disorders.

## Function

The function of PTCHD1 is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in synaptic function and plasticity in the brain.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type

There are several AA mutations that have been identified in PTCHD1. Some of these include:

- p.R788*
- p.L1015*
- p.R848*
- p.R1107*

These mutations are all predicted to result in a premature stop codon.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in PTCHD1.

## Related Disease

PTCHD1 mutations have been associated with several neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for PTCHD1-related disorders. Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive, and may include behavioral and educational interventions, as well as medications for symptoms such as seizures and anxiety.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information on drug response specifically related to PTCHD1 mutations.
