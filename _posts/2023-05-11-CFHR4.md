## Gene: CFHR4

Function: The CFHR4Â gene encodes a protein that belongs to the complement factor H protein family. The complement system is a critical part of the immune response that helps to identify pathogens and neutralize them. The CFHR4 protein plays a role in regulating this system by binding to complement components and preventing their activation.

Somatic SNVs/InDels:

No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for CFHR4.

Related Disease:

Mutations in CFHR4 have been linked to atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), a rare genetic disease that causes damage to blood vessels and can lead to kidney failure.

Treatment and Prognosis:

There is currently no cure for aHUS, but treatment options vary depending on the severity of symptoms and may include plasma therapy, dialysis, and immunosuppressive drugs.

Drug Response:

There is limited information available on drug response specific to CFHR4 mutations.
