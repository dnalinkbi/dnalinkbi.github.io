# Gene: NAGLU

## Information
The NAGLU gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2 and encodes for the enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). Mutations in this gene can lead to the lysosomal storage disorder known as mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB).

## Function
The NAGLU enzyme is responsible for breaking down certain complex sugars in lysosomes. Mutations in NAGLU reduce or eliminate the activity of the enzyme, leading to accumulation of partially broken-down sugars in lysosomes.

## Related Disease
Mutations in NAGLU can lead to the lysosomal storage disorder MPS IIIB, which is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, behavioral abnormalities, and other symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for MPS IIIB. Treatment options are mainly supportive and aim to manage the symptoms of the disease. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is currently no targeted drug therapy for MPS IIIB. Enzyme replacement therapy is not effective for this disease due to the inability of the NAGLU enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier. Some drugs, such as genistein, have shown promise in preclinical studies.
