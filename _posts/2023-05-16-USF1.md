# Gene USF1

## Information

### Genetic Position
The USF1 gene is located on the chromosome 1 at the position 1q22.

### Pathology
The USF1 gene encodes for the Upstream Stimulatory Factor 1 protein which plays a role in regulating gene expression. Various studies have shown that mutations in the USF1 gene are associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes.

### Function
The USF1 protein acts as a transcription factor which binds to the DNA and modulates gene expression. It is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism as well as cell proliferation and differentiation.

- Metabolic syndrome

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for USF1 mutations. However, the risk of developing metabolic disorders can be mitigated by adopting a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise. The prognosis for individuals with USF1 mutations depends on the severity and extent of the associated metabolic disorders.

### Drug Response
The effect of USF1 mutations on drug response is currently unknown.
