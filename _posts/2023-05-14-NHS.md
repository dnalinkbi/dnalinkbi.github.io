# Information on Gene NHS

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

- *Genetic position*: The NHS gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp22.13.
- *Pathology*: Variants in the NHS gene are associated with Nance-Horan syndrome, which is characterized by congenital cataracts, dental anomalies, and facial dysmorphism.
- *Function*: The NHS protein is involved in the development of several tissues, including the eye and tooth.
