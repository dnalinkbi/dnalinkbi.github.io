# Information About Gene UNC93B1

### Genomic Position
UNC93B1 is located on chromosome 11q13.4.

### Pathology
Mutations in the UNC93B1 gene have been found to cause susceptibility to herpes simplex encephalitis and Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

### Function
The UNC93B1 gene encodes a protein that is responsible for transporting nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to endolysosomes for the activation of immune responses.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 21241
- NCBI Entrez: 81622
- Ensembl: ENSG00000168331
- OMIM: 607074
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86TI0

Aliases: KIAA0319, MGC23362

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Lys66Gln (rs61746678)
- p.Arg95Trp (rs61753871)
- p.Lys131Arg (rs35829420)
- p.Leu567Trp (rs367543003)
- p.Thr620Met (rs79704490)

All of the AA mutations occur on the UNC93B1 protein and are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no data available on somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in the UNC93B1 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Herpes simplex encephalitis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for herpes simplex encephalitis, but treatment can help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. SLE is a chronic condition that typically requires lifelong treatment with medications that suppress the immune system.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response for mutations in UNC93B1.
