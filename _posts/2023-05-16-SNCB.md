# Gene Information for SNCB

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 
- **Genetic Position**: SNCB is located on chromosome 5q35.2
- **Pathology**: SNCB has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) through its role in the aggregation of alpha-synuclein protein, which is a key feature of PD neuropathology.
- **Function**: SNCB encodes beta-synuclein, a protein that is primarily expressed in neurons and plays a role in synaptic function, neuronal plasticity, and neurotransmitter release. 

## Gene Information
- **Function for gene**: Encodes beta-synuclein protein
- **External IDs**:
    - Gene ID: 6621
    - Genomic Location: chr5:175,011,135-175,015,244
    - Aliases: beta-synuclein, SNCB
- **External Sites**: 
    - HGNC: 11195
    - NCBI Entrez: 6621
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000134108
    - OMIM: 602216
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O75884
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 
No pathogenic mutations have been identified in SNCB as of yet. 
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
No somatic variants in SNCB have been reported in the literature.
- **Related Disease**: Parkinson's disease
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: 
Treatment for Parkinson's disease primarily focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the individual and the progression of the disease. 
- **Drug response**: 
Studies have suggested that beta-synuclein may play a role in modulating the efficacy of certain Parkinson's disease treatments, such as dopamine agonists. However, more research is needed to fully understand the implications of this finding.
