## Gene: SIX5

### Genomic location: 
SIX5 is located on chromosome 19, at position 19q13.33.

### Pathology:
Mutations in SIX5 have been associated with various eye disorders, including glaucoma and myopia.

### Function:
SIX5 encodes a protein that belongs to the homeobox family of transcription factors, which are involved in regulating gene expression during development. Specifically, SIX5 is involved in eye development and maintenance.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Glu215Lys (rs750202798) - missense mutation
- p.Arg350Gln (rs1052755) - missense mutation 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for SIX5.

### Related disease:
Mutations in SIX5 have been associated with various eye disorders, including:
- Primary open angle glaucoma
- High myopia with cataract and vitreoretinal degeneration

### Treatment and prognosis:
Treatment for SIX5-associated eye disorders typically involves management of symptoms, such as controlling intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

### Drug response:
