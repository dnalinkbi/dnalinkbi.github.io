# Information about gene DAG1

## Gene Overview
- DAG1 stands for **dystroglycan 1**. 
- It is located on the **chromosome 3q29**. 
- DAG1 codes for a protein dystroglycan, which is a part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

## Function of Gene
- Dystroglycan protein plays a crucial role in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle function, as well as in the maintenance of neuronal and retinal integrity.
- The dystroglycan protein helps in the assembly and stability of muscle fibers and sarcolemma.

## External IDs and Aliases
- IDs: HGNC: 2708, NCBI Entrez: 1605, Ensembl: ENSG00000169371, OMIM: 128239, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14118
- Aliases: BDPLT11, DAG, DAG1A, DAG1B, DAG1C, DAG1D, DAG1E, DAG1F

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations that have been reported in DAG1:
- G364R missense mutation (rs61731485)
- T192A missense mutation (rs760644077)
- S329L missense mutation (rs137853312)
- T192A missense mutation (rs760644077)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels that have been recorded in DAG1:
- rs104894888
- rs104894889
- rs104894890
- rs104894891

## Related Disease
- Mutation in DAG1 results in various types of muscular dystrophies, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophy.
- Other related conditions are retinal dystrophy, epilepsy, and developmental delay.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- At present, there is no cure available for muscular dystrophy, and the treatment aims to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.
- Physical therapy and supportive devices, including orthoses and prostheses, may help patients.
- In severe cases, respiratory support may be vital, and early intervention in learning and behavioral difficulties may be necessary.

## Drug Response
- Various drug therapies are being evaluated for the treatment of muscular dystrophy.
- Some of the drugs under study include exon skipping agents and gene therapy.
