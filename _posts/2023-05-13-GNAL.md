# Gene GNAL

## Information
- **Function:** The GNAL gene encodes for the G protein subunit alpha L protein, which is involved in the regulation of dopamine and adrenergic signaling pathways.
- **External IDs:**
    - Gene ID: 57404
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 18q21.33
    - Aliases: G_Alpha_11, GNA11L, GNA117, Galpha11, GNA11
- **External Sites:**
    - HGNC: 4391
    - NCBI Entrez: [57404](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57404))
    - Ensembl: [ENSG00000172910](https://ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000172910;r=18q21.33))

    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: [Q9UIX4](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UIX4))
- **AA Mutation List:**

| AA Position | Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|:-----------:|:--------:|:----:|:--------:|
|     196     |   L -> F  | Missense |  rs2230054 |
|     197     |   A -> T  | Missense |  rs2230053 |
|     215     |   P -> A  | Missense |  rs2230055 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
    - No somatic mutations have been reported in GNAL.
- **Related Disease:**
    - GNAL mutations have been associated with primary torsion dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by muscle contractions and spasms.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - Treatment for primary torsion dystonia includes botulinum toxin injections, deep brain stimulation, and medications such as anticholinergics and dopamine-depleting agents. The prognosis for primary torsion dystonia varies depending on the severity and progression of symptoms.
- **Drug Response:**
    - Patients with primary torsion dystonia have shown response to botulinum toxin injections and dopamine-depleting medications.
