# Information about Gene EIF4E

### Genetic Position:
The gene EIF4E is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 at position 4q21.1.

### Pathology:
Mutations in the EIF4E gene have been associated with different diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

### Function:
The EIF4E gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. Specifically, eIF4E recognizes and binds to the 5' cap structure of mRNA, recruiting other translation initiation factors to begin the translation process.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- **HGNC**: 3295
- **NCBI Entrez**: 1977
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000167775
- **OMIM**: 133440
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P06730
- **Aliases**: EIF4E1, eIF-4E, F4E

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- p.R57H (rs61732910): This is a missense mutation found in the EIF4E gene that has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The mutation results in the substitution of a histidine residue for an arginine residue at position 57 of the eIF4E protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.325G>A (rs116059376): This somatic mutation has been identified in lung cancer patients and results in the substitution of a glutamic acid residue for a lysine residue at position 109 of the eIF4E protein.
- c.466G>A (rs148560825): This somatic mutation has been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and results in the substitution of a glycine residue for an arginine residue at position 156 of the eIF4E protein.

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the EIF4E gene have been associated with different diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with EIF4E mutations depend on the specific disease and the individual patient. In general, treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with EIF4E mutations may also vary, depending on factors such as the stage of the disease and the patient's overall health.

### Drug Response:
There is limited information on the drug response specifically related to EIF4E mutations. However, drugs targeting the translation initiation complex are currently being investigated for the treatment of different cancers.
