## Gene HSP90AA1

### Genetic Position
The gene HSP90AA1 is located on chromosome 14 at the position q32.33. 

### Pathology
HSP90AA1 has been linked to various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.

### Function
HSP90AA1 encodes for a member of the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) family, which is involved in the folding, assembly, and stabilization of a wide range of proteins in the cell. HSP90AA1 also functions in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and transcriptional regulation.
