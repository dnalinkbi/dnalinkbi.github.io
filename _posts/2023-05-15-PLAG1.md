## Gene: PLAG1

- Function: The PLAG1 gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues. It plays a crucial role in embryonic development, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis.

- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 5324 
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 8q12.1 
    - Aliases: PLAG, ZAC1, ZNF912

    - HGNC: 9089 
    - NCBI Entrez: 5324 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000147889 
    - OMIM: 603044 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6GZX4

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: There are several germline and somatic mutations reported in PLAG1 gene. Some of the common mutations are:
    - p.E69K (rs397514651) Missense mutation 
    - p.R74C (rs59634309) Missense mutation 
    - p.R73H (rs79676337) Missense mutation 
    - p.P44L (rs781602743) Missense mutation

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Various somatic SNVs and InDels have been reported in PLAG1 gene in different types of cancers. Some of them are:
    - c.1588C>T (rs397514652) Missense mutation 
    - c.1588C>G (rs121912751) Missense mutation

    - Pleomorphic adenoma 
    - Salivary gland tumors 
    - Breast cancer 
    - Ovarian cancer 
    - Adenoid cystic carcinoma 
    
- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment and prognosis of PLAG1-related diseases vary according to the type and stage of cancer. Surgery is the primary treatment option for most of the tumors, and adjuvant therapies like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy may be used as per the clinician's recommendation.

- Drug response: There are no specific drugs available for PLAG1-related tumors. However, some targeted therapies like imatinib and sorafenib have been used in the treatment of advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma.
