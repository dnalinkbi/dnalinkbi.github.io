# Information about Gene HNRNPA2B1 

## Gene Information 

**Function**: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1) is a RNA-binding protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and regulation of alternative splicing. It also plays a role in RNA stability, transport, and translation. 

**External IDs**: HGNC:5038, NCBI Entrez: 3181, Ensembl: ENSG00000105383, OMIM: 600220, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P22626

**Aliases**: HNRPA2B1, HNRNPA2, SNRNPB, hnRNP core protein A2, A2/B1, HNRPA2, MGC104329

## Mutations 

**AA Mutation List**:
- p.Gly154Asp (rs138227940)
- p.Arg225Trp (rs146024259)
- p.Arg252Ser (rs74728934)

**Mutation Type**: Missense mutation 

**dbSNP ID**: rs138227940, rs146024259, rs74728934

## Somatic SNVs/InDels 

**dbSNP ID**: No known somatic mutations reported in dbSNP 

## Pathology and Related Diseases 

- HNRNPA2B1 mutations have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and multisystem proteinopathy (MSP). 
- Dysregulation of HNRNPA2B1 expression has also been observed in various types of cancer.
