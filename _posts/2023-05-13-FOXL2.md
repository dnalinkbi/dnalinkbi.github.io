### Gene Information

Gene: FOXL2

Pathology: Mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been associated with Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) and Ovarian Dysfunction (OD)

Function: The FOXL2 gene encodes a forkhead transcription factor that plays a critical role in ovarian development and function. It is also involved in eyelid and facial development.

### Related Disease

- Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) – a rare genetic disorder characterized by drooping of the eyelids, a narrowed eye opening, and reduced width of the eye opening.
- Ovarian Dysfunction – a condition that affects the function of the ovaries, resulting in irregular menstrual cycles and reduced fertility.

### Treatment, Prognosis, and Drug Response

There is currently no cure for BPES and Ovarian Dysfunction and treatment is based on managing the symptoms associated with these conditions. Hormone therapy may be used to treat the infertility associated with ovarian dysfunction. Gene therapy or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing may be potential future treatments for patients with FOXL2 mutations.
