## Gene PRPF3

* **Function for gene**: PRPF3 (Pre-mRNA Processing Factor 3) encodes a protein that is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing.

* **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: HGNC: PRPF3, NCBI Entrez: 9129, Ensembl: ENSG00000178763, OMIM: 607597, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60231. Aliases include RP18, PRP3, PRP6, HPRP3.

* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: A missense mutation (p.Asp220His) in PRPF3 has been reported in a patient with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP18) (dbSNP ID: rs121909230).

* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Not available.

* **Related disease**: PRPF3 mutations have been associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP18), an inherited eye disorder that leads to progressive vision loss.

* **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for RP18 is mainly supportive and includes low-vision aids and orientation and mobility training. The prognosis varies among individuals and depends on the severity of the disease.

* **Drug response**: Not available.
