# Gene CD5

## Information
- **Gene:** CD5
- **Aliases:** T1, LEU1, Ly-1
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 11 (11q23)
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 1678
    - NCBI Entrez: 921
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000116760
    - OMIM: 153340
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P06127

## Function
The CD5 gene encodes for a protein known as CD5 antigen, which is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in signal transduction and T cell activation. It has been shown to interact with other proteins such as CD6, TCR/CD3 complex and Lck, and play an important role in mediating cellular responses to antigens.

## Related diseases
The CD5 gene has been associated with various diseases, such as:
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- B cell lymphoma
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus

## Treatment and prognosis
CD5 expression has been suggested as a marker for prognosis and response to therapy in certain diseases. In CLL, for example, high expression of CD5 has been associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, several therapies targeting CD5 have been developed for CLL and B cell lymphoma treatment.

## Drug response
The monoclonal antibody Rituximab, which specifically targets CD20, has been used as a CD5-targeting therapy in CLL and B cell lymphoma treatment.
