# Information about gene AKT2

## Genetic Position
The AKT2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.2 (19q13.2).

## Pathology
AKT2 is a gene that encodes for a protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling pathway. Genetic mutations in AKT2 have been associated with various conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancers, and microvascular complications of diabetes.

## Function
AKT2 plays a critical role in the insulin signaling pathway by regulating glucose metabolism in the body. It helps in the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface, which enables glucose uptake in adipose and muscle tissues. AKT2 also promotes cell growth and inhibits cell apoptosis by activating various downstream signaling pathways.

## Related Disease
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Breast cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Different treatment options are available depending on the disease. In the case of type 2 diabetes, lifestyle modifications, oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin therapy are used for treatment. For some cancers, AKT inhibitors are used as a targeted therapy. The prognosis varies depending on the type and stage of the disease.

## Drug Response
Several drugs that target AKT2 protein kinase activity have been developed and tested in clinical trials. The response to these drugs depends on the patient's genetic profile, disease progression, and other factors.
