# Information about Gene PCCA

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location
Gene PCCA, also known as propionyl-CoA carboxylase gene, is located on chromosome 13q32.3. The genomic coordinates are from 98,967,233 to 99,072,433 bp.

## Pathology and Function
The PCCA gene encodes the alpha subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. Mutations in this gene can lead to propionic acidemia, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of propionic acid in the blood and tissues. This can cause metabolic acidosis, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and other complications.

- p.R410Q: missense mutation, rs758903406
- p.E510X: nonsense mutation, rs41289499
- p.G462V: missense mutation, rs137853032

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels of the PCCA gene.

## Related Disease
PCCA mutations are associated with propionic acidemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that affects about 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for propionic acidemia involves a low-protein diet, supplementation with L-carnitine, and emergency treatment of metabolic crises. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the timing of diagnosis and treatment.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs that specifically target the PCCA gene or propionic acidemia. Treatment is primarily supportive and aimed at managing symptoms.
