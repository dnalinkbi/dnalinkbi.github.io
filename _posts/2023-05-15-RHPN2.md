# Gene Information for RHPN2 

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** RHPN2 gene is situated on chromosome 14q11.2.
- **Pathology:** Abnormal levels of RHPN2 have been linked to cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma.
- **Function:** RHPN2 gene codes for Rhophilin-2, a GTP-binding protein that plays a role in actin dynamics, cell shape, and motility.
