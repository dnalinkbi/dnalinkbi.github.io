# Gene CHRM2

## Gene Information
- **Function**: The CHRM2 gene encodes a member of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides, and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins.
- **External IDs**: The gene CHRM2 is located on chromosome 7 at the location 7q31.1. The external IDs for the gene are as follows:
    - HGNC: 1952
    - NCBI Entrez: 1128
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000174775
    - OMIM: 118493
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08172
- **Aliases**: HM2, M2R

## Genetic Variations
- **AA mutation list**: 
    - p.Arg87Cys
    - p.Ile90Val
    - p.Ser113Phe
- **Mutation type**: Missense
- **dbSNP ID**: rs1809978, rs2060417, rs2060418

## Somatic Variations
- **dbSNP ID**: rs363050

## Related Disease
The CHRM2 gene has been associated with various diseases such as:
- Alzheimer's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Major Depressive Disorder
- Substance dependence

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for diseases associated with the CHRM2 gene. Treatment usually involves managing the symptoms and may include the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other medications. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and its severity.

## Drug response
Drug response to medications that affect the CHRM2 receptor may vary depending on the specific drug and the individual's genetic makeup.
