## Gene Information
- **Gene Symbol:** SLC37A4
- **Gene Name:** Solute Carrier Family 37 Member 4
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11q23.3

## Function
The SLC37A4 gene encodes for a transmembrane protein that is responsible for the transport of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) from the cytoplasmic side to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein plays an important role in regulating glucose homeostasis and glycogen metabolism.

- **OMIM ID:** 602671
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** O43826
- **Aliases:** G6PT1, G6PT2, G6PTS

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the SLC37A4 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SLC37A4 gene are associated with Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1B (GSD1B), also known as von Gierke disease. This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability to produce glucose from glycogen due to the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. The symptoms include hypoglycemia, growth retardation, hepatomegaly, and lactic acidosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of GSD1B includes frequent feeds, nocturnal nasogastric feeds, and a diet rich in complex carbohydrates. Cornstarch therapy is an effective treatment that maintains euglycemia and prevents hypoglycemia. Long-term prognosis is good with appropriate management.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that targets the SLC37A4 gene directly. However, cornstarch therapy has been shown to be effective in managing GSD1B.
