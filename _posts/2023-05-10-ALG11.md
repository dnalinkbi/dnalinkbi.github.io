# Gene: ALG11

## Information

### Gene Position:

ALG11 is located on chromosome 13q14.3.

### Function:

The ALG11 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the initial steps of protein N-linked glycosylation, which is the process by which a carbohydrate molecule is attached to a protein. Specifically, the ALG11 protein is responsible for the transfer of the first glucose residue to the growing oligosaccharide chain during N-linked glycosylation.

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 28804
- NCBI Entrez: 340587
- Ensembl: ENSG00000120948
- OMIM: 611091
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86WK3

### AA Mutation List:
There are several AA mutations associated with the ALG11 gene, including:
- p.Thr269Ala
- p.Lys264fs
- p.Arg475Trp
- p.Leu409Ser

### Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:
The p.Thr269Ala mutation is a missense mutation and has dbSNP ID rs137852150. The p.Lys264fs mutation is a frameshift mutation and has dbSNP ID rs113994090. The p.Arg475Trp mutation is a missense mutation and has dbSNP ID rs146905291. The p.Leu409Ser mutation is a missense mutation and has dbSNP ID rs138115447.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the ALG11 gene.

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the ALG11 gene have been associated with Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ip (CDGIp), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Symptoms of CDGIp can vary, but typically include developmental delays, seizures, liver dysfunction, and abnormal blood clotting.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no cure for CDGIp, and treatment options are limited. Management of symptoms may include physical, occupational, and speech therapies, as well as medications to control seizures and liver dysfunction.

### Drug Response:
There is currently no information on drug response specific to mutations in the ALG11 gene.
