# Analysis of Gene CFHR1

## Gene Information

- Function: The CFHR1 gene encodes for a complement factor H-related protein that is involved in the regulation of the complement system, which is responsible for the innate immune response.
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 3077
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 1; 109,561,901-109,578,209
    - Aliases: AHUS4, FHR1, CFHL3, HRF, STG

## Genetic Variants

- AA Mutation List:
    - p.Ile208Thr (rs121912785)
    - p.Arg155Trp (rs121912786)
- Mutation Type: Missense Mutation
- Somatic SNVs/InDels:
    - None reported in dbSNP

## Related Diseases

Mutations in CFHR1 have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
- Age-related macular degeneration
- IgA nephropathy
- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for diseases associated with CFHR1 mutations is primarily supportive, and may include dialysis or kidney transplant for those with kidney disease. The prognosis for individuals with CFHR1-associated diseases varies depending on the severity and progression of the condition.

## Drug Response

There is limited information on how CFHR1 mutations affect drug response.
