## Gene: CBR1

CBR1 gene is located on chromosome 21q22.13. It encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme carbonyl reductase which belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family.

### Function
The CBR1 gene plays a crucial role in metabolizing xenobiotics and endogenous molecules such as anthracyclines, ketones, and prostaglandins. It catalyzes the reduction of carbonyl and prostaglandin H2 to their respective alcohols.

### Related diseases
Mutations in the CBR1 gene have been linked to the development of certain types of cancer such as colorectal and prostate cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for individuals with CBR1 gene mutations may vary depending on the specific mutation and associated disease.

### Drug response
Mutations in the CBR1 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism and response to certain drugs such as anthracyclines and tamoxifen.
