# Genetic Information Analysis Report

## Gene: DHX37

### General Information
- **Function:** DHX37 encodes a member of the DEAH-box RNA helicase family that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism. The encoded protein is involved in splicing, mRNA nuclear export, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
- **Aliases:** DEAH-box helicase 37, G3BP-interacting protein, DHX97, DDX37, G3BP-interacting protein 1, G3BP1, DEAD box protein 37
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 16038
    - NCBI Entrez: 9786
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000143354
    - OMIM: 609795
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96FC9

### Genomic Location
- **Chromosome:** 17
- **Genomic Position:** 17q25.3

### Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are currently no known amino acid mutations for DHX37.
- **Mutation Types and dbSNP IDs:** There are currently no known mutations in DHX37 listed in the dbSNP database.

### Related Diseases
- **Disease:** Perrault Syndrome 4
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive 
- **Symptoms:** This disease is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysfunction in females caused by mutations in genes that affect the maintenance and function of mitochondria.
- **DHX37 Specifics:** DHX37 has been found to be a causative gene for Perrault Syndrome 4.

### Treatment and Prognosis
