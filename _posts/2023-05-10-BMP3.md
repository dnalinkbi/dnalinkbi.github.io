# Gene BMP3

## Information

BMP3 is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family. This gene is located on chromosome 4q22.1 and encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 47.4 kDa. BMP3 is also known by several aliases including Osteogenin, OSGN, and ORF-6. 

## Function

BMP3 functions as a negative regulator of bone formation and plays an important role in bone remodeling. It inhibits the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, leading to reduced bone density. BMP3 also acts as an antagonist of the BMP signaling pathway, which regulates a variety of cellular processes including embryonic development, tissue differentiation, and regeneration.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported mutations in BMP3, including missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and nonsense mutations. Some of the variants with their dbSNP IDs are:

- rs61756798: c.316G>A (p.Arg106Gln)
- rs147509784: c.253delC (p.Gln85fs)
- rs767055562: c.671G>A (p.Trp224Ter)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported in BMP3. Some of the variants with their dbSNP IDs are:

- rs121913449: c.53C>T (p.Arg18Ter)
- rs149019119: c.286A>G (p.Thr96Ala)

## Related disease

BMP3 mutations have been associated with several bone-related diseases. These diseases include:

- Osteogenesis imperfecta type XV: A rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low bone density, multiple fractures, and deformities.
- Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine: A condition in which the spinal ligaments thicken and calcify, leading to compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no specific treatment for BMP3 mutations. However, management of bone-related symptoms such as fractures and deformities can be done using standard approaches. The prognosis for individuals with BMP3 mutations depends on the severity of the associated bone disorder. 

## Drug response

There is currently no information available on drug response for BMP3 mutations.
