# Gene SHROOM4

## Genomic location and aliases
- External ID: SHROOM4 (HGNC: 21533)
- Genomic location: Chromosome Xq22.1
- Aliases: KIAA1090, KIAA1758, SHM4

## Function
The SHROOM4 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the SHROOM family of actin-binding proteins. It is involved in the regulation of cell shape and motility, particularly during neural tube closure and brain development. SHROOM4 interacts with other proteins to promote actin filament assembly and regulate the formation of cell junctions. 

## Mutation information
- AA mutation list: p.Cys1042Tyr, p.Arg1102* 
- Mutation type: Missense, Nonsense
- dbSNP ID: rs150641324, rs137853351

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: rs4141364, rs75306069, rs77099787, rs200871446, rs143919238, rs1201802, rs13034211, rs13072881

## Related disease
SHROOM4 mutations have been associated with spina bifida and other neural tube defects. Additionally, variations in the gene have been linked to various psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for spina bifida involves surgical repair of the spinal defect, as well as ongoing care to manage associated complications. The prognosis for individuals with spina bifida depends on the severity of the defect and any additional health problems.

## Drug response
There is currently no specific drug therapy for SHROOM4-associated disorders, but various treatments may be used to address symptoms and complications.
