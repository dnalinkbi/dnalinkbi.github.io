# Information about Gene PPP1CB

## Genetic Position

Gene PPP1CB is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 31.1.

## Pathology

A number of studies have suggested that PPP1CB plays a key role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. PPP1CB has been shown to be overexpressed in a range of cancer types such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function

PPP1CB encodes for a protein called Protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta isoform. This protein belongs to the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family and functions as a major regulator of protein dephosphorylation. PPP1CB plays a crucial role in many cellular processes including cell division, DNA damage repair, and glycogen metabolism.
