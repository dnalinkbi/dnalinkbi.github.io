# Gene BUB1 Information

## Genetic Position
The BUB1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q13).

## Pathology
Mutations in the BUB1 gene have been associated with several malignancies, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and glioma. These mutations may contribute to chromosomal instability and impaired DNA repair mechanisms.

## Function
The BUB1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell division. Specifically, the protein is a mitotic checkpoint kinase that helps ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.
