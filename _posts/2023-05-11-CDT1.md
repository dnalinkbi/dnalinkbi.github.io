## Information about gene CDT1

CDT1 is a gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.3). It encodes for a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell division and DNA replication. Aberrations in the CDT1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including cancer.

### Function for gene 
CDT1 is an essential component of the pre-replication complex, which is required for DNA replication. It plays a critical role in the initiation of DNA replication by recruiting other proteins to the site of DNA replication.
