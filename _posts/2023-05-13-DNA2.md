## Gene: DNA2

### Genetic Position
The DNA2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q21.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the DNA2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and mitochondrial diseases.

### Function
The DNA2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. It is involved in the removal of RNA primers during DNA replication, as well as in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks.
