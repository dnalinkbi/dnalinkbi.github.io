# Gene: SND1
## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: 7q21.3

## Pathology
Mutations in the SND1 gene have been associated with multiple diseases, including cancer, liver cirrhosis, and neurological disorders.

## Function
The SND1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called staphylococcal nuclease and Tudor domain-containing protein 1. SND1 is involved in several cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and protein translation.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and the severity of SND1 mutations.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug available for SND1 mutations. Treatment options depend on the associated disease and its drug response.
