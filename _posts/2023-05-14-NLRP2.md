# Information about Gene NLRP2

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function
- **Genetic Position**: NLRP2 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.42
- **Function for Gene**: NLRP2 encodes a protein belonging to the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, involved in the innate immune system as a sensor of pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns. NLRP2 also plays a role in early development and embryo implantation.
- **Pathology**: Alterations in NLRP2 expression have been associated with several pathological conditions including pregnancy complications, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.
