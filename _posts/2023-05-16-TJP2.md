# Information about Gene TJP2

## Genetic Position
The TJP2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 at position 9q21.13.

## Pathology and Function
TJP2 encodes the protein ZO-2, which is a tight junction protein involved in regulating the permeability of cell layers and maintaining cell polarity. ZO-2 has been found to play a role in cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Mutations in TJP2 have been associated with various diseases such as deafness, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer.
