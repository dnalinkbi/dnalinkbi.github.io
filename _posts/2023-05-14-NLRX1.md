## Gene NLRX1

### Position
The gene NLRX1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5).

### Pathology
Studies have shown that NLRX1 modulates immune responses and may play a role in various diseases, including viral and bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

### Function
NLRX1 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of innate immune responses. NLRX1 has been shown to negatively regulate the production of type-I interferons and inflammatory cytokines, and to inhibit the activation of NF-ÎºB signaling pathways.
