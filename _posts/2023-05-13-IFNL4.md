## Gene name: IFNL4

### Function
IFNL4 (Interferon lambda 4) is a cytokine that belongs to the family of type III interferons. It plays a vital role in the innate immune response to viral infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV).

- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 101017516
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000275900
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 19p13.2

### Aliases
- IFN lambda 4
- IFN-Lambda-IV
- Interferon lambda 4

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known AA Mutations found for IFNL4.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
