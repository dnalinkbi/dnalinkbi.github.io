# Gene: ACACA

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Start Position: 44,773,866 bp
- End Position: 44,980,328 bp

## Pathology
ACACA gene mutations have been associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

## Function
The ACACA gene encodes the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, which is responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids required for energy storage. This enzyme is primarily expressed in liver, adipose tissue, and lactating mammary glands.  

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 87
- NCBI Entrez: 31
- Ensembl: ENSG00000026508
- OMIM: 200350
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13085
- Aliases: ACAC, ACC, ACC1, ACCL, KIAA0132

## AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
Here are some of the ACACA gene mutations reported in humans along with their mutation types and corresponding dbSNP IDs:
- p.Ala2029Val (missense mutation) - rs2229177
- p.Ser2219Gly (missense mutation) - rs118204029
- p.Asn2217Ser (missense mutation) - rs61751923

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations of ACACA gene reported in cancer, including:
- c.7317C>A (missense mutation) - rs1553578996
- c.7001A>G (missense mutation) - rs146622954

## Related Disease
ACACA gene mutations have been linked with several disorders, including:
- Obesity
- Insulin Resistance
- Type 2 diabetes

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disorder developed due to ACACA mutations. For example, weight management, and maintaining the glucose level within the range can be beneficial for individuals with diabetes.

## Drug Response
ACACA is a potential target for the treatment of obesity, and some drugs, like soraphen A and ND-630, have shown to reduce body fat and improve glucose tolerance.
