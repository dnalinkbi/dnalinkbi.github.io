# Gene POF1B
## Genomic Information
- **Location:** Chromosome 12; 112,429,307 - 112,482,505 bp
- **Aliases:** ZFR, FLJ21910, Zfp191, dJ857M17.2, Znf310
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 25289
    - NCBI Entrez: 79084
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000110963
    - OMIM: 612535
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6PJP8

## Function
POF1B encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell morphology. Specifically, it plays a role in the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are several missense mutations reported in the POF1B gene, including:
    - p.Arg800His
    - p.Asn503Asp
    - p.Arg134Cys
    - p.Ala533Val
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs200752594, rs201869526, rs281865631, rs200687323

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the POF1B gene.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in POF1B have been linked to several genetic disorders, including:
- Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)
- Ovarian Dysgenesis 7 (ODG7)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for the genetic diseases associated with POF1B mutations. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and addressing complications, including infertility.

## Drug Response
There are currently no known drugs that directly target the POF1B gene.
