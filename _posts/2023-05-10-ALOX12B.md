# Gene Information for ALOX12B

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The ALOX12B gene is located on chromosome 17q25.3 and encodes for a protein called arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, which is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. Mutations in this gene are known to cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder called nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE), which is characterized by dry, scaly skin. 

## Function for Gene
The encoded protein plays a critical role in the formation of the skin barrier by metabolizing fatty acids into lipids that are then incorporated into the stratum corneum of the skin. It is also involved in the production of eicosanoids, molecules that play significant roles in inflammation and immune responses.

Currently there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the ALOX12B gene are associated with nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE), an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for NCIE, but treatment is supportive and aims to improve the symptoms. This may involve topical emollients, keratolytics, and oral retinoids. The prognosis for NCIE varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There are currently no known drugs that specifically target ALOX12B mutations in NCIE.
