# Information about gene RTN2

## Genetic Position
The RTN2 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2, from base pair 39,196,153 to 39,407,083.

## Pathology
Studies have suggested that RTN2 gene may play a role in several pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.

## Function
The RTN2 gene encodes for a protein called Reticulon-2, which is involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure, shape, and function. It plays a key role in the formation and maintenance of tubular ER networks and the interaction of the ER with other cellular components.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Spastic Paraplegia 12. The treatment mainly focuses on managing the symptoms and reducing the progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is little information regarding drug response for RTN2 gene associated diseases.
