## Gene ENO3

The ENO3 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.31 and its genomic location is from 43,623,017 to 43,628,329. The gene is also known by its aliases beta-enolase 3 and enolase 3 (muscle). 

### Function

The ENO3 gene encodes for the protein enolase 3, which is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis. Specifically, enolase 3 catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate.

### External IDs

The external IDs for the ENO3 gene are as follows:

- HGNC: 3359
- NCBI Entrez: 2026
- Ensembl: ENSG00000074800
- OMIM: 131370
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13929
