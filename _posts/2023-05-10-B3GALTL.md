## Gene: B3GALTL

### Genetic Position:
B3GALTL is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q12.3).

### Pathology:
B3GALTL is associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Peters-plus syndrome (PPS). PPS is characterized by developmental abnormalities of the eye, including Peters anomaly, as well as short stature, limb abnormalities, and developmental delay.

### Function:
B3GALTL encodes an enzyme called beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase that is responsible for synthesizing a complex sugar structure called the type 1 chain on glycoproteins and glycolipids.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for B3GALTL.

### Related Disease:
B3GALTL mutations are associated with Peters-plus syndrome (PPS).

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for Peters-plus syndrome, and treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the individual's symptoms.

### Drug Response:
There are currently no drugs available that specifically target B3GALTL or Peters-plus syndrome.
