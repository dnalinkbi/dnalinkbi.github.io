# Genetic information analysis of the TLR9 gene

## Gene Information

- Function for gene:
  - The TLR9 gene encodes a type of toll-like receptor (TLR) that recognizes DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs. This recognition leads to the production of cytokines and activation of immune cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells.

- External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:
  - Gene ID: 54106
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 3, 47,360,922-47,368,918 (GRCh38.p13)
  - Aliases: toll-like receptor 9, TLR-9, UNQ312/PRO353

- External sites:
  - HGNC: 11858
  - NCBI Entrez: 54106
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000186810
  - OMIM: 608368
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NR96

## Mutations

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
  - p.Asp299Gly (rs187084)
  - p.Leu412Phe (rs352140)
  - p.Val602Ile (rs5743836)
  
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for TLR9.

## Related Disease

- TLR9 mutations have been linked to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

## Treatment and Prognosis

- The treatment and prognosis for TLR9-related diseases depend on the specific disease and severity of symptoms. Current treatments include immunosuppressive drugs, biologic therapies targeting cytokines, and anti-inflammatory agents.

## Drug response

- TLR9 agonists and antagonists are being developed as potential therapies for various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases.
