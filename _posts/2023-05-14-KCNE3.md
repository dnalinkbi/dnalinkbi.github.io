## KCNE3 Gene Information

- **Function:** The KCNE3 gene encodes for a protein that is a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit. It plays a role in regulating the activity of potassium channels in the heart, colon, and other tissues.
- **External IDs:** KCNE3 is also known as Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily E Member 3. Its genomic location is on chromosome 11 at locus 11q13.2. Other aliases of KCNE3 include MiRP2 and MIRPL2.

### Related Diseases

KCNE3 mutations have been associated with several diseases including:

- Long QT Syndrome
- Atrial fibrillation
- Hypertension
- Colorectal cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

There are currently no specific treatments for KCNE3-related diseases. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and reducing the risk of complications. Prognosis depends on the specific disease and its severity.

### Drug Response

Studies have shown that KCNE3 may play a role in the response to certain drugs used to treat arrhythmias. However, more research is needed to fully understand this relationship.
