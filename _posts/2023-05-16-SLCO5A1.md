# Genetic Information for gene SLCO5A1

## Gene Overview
SLCO5A1 is a gene that is located on chromosome 11q13.5. Its official symbol according to HGNC is "SLCO5A1". It has several aliases including "OATP5A1", "LST2", "OATPL", and "OATP-L". The gene encodes a solute carrier organic anion transporter family member. This transporter is involved in the transport of various organic compounds between extracellular and intracellular plasma membranes. The function of this transporter in humans is not completely understood.
