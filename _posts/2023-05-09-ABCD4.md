# Gene: ABCD4
### Function:
The ABCD4 gene is involved in the transport of vitamin B12 into the cells. It encodes a protein that is localized to the lysosomal membrane and is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 51
- NCBI Entrez: 5821
- Ensembl: ENSG00000058404
- OMIM: 603214
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P28037

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg735Ter (stop-gain mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs121908630
- p.Arg584His (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID: rs1235723540

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the ABCD4 gene.

### Related Disease:
- Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblJ type

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment involves supplementation of vitamin B12 and betaine. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent or ameliorate the developmental delay and neurological symptoms.

### Drug Response:
