## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome X (Xq28)
- **Pathology:** XK gene mutations lead to the McLeod Syndrome, a rare X-linked recessive disorder.
- **Function:** The XK gene encodes a protein that is involved in the formation of the Kell blood-group antigens on the surface of red blood cells.

## External IDs

- **Gene ID:** 7505
- **Genomic Location:** NC_000023.11 (147,260,574...147,310,027)
- **Aliases:** KX, Kx1, McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome protein

## Related Disease

- **McLeod Syndrome:** McLeod syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by muscular and neurological abnormalities, such as chorea, dystonia, and Parkinsonism, and blood abnormalities, such as acanthocytosis, anemia, and reduced red blood cells.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for McLeod Syndrome. Treatment consists of managing symptoms such as psychological counseling, medications to manage movement disorders, botulinum injections to reduce muscle spasms, and blood transfusions to manage anemia.

## Drug Response

There is no currently approved drug treatment for McLeod Syndrome.
