# Gene DHCR24
## Genetic Position
The DHCR24 gene is located on chromosome 1q23.3.

## Pathology
Variants in DHCR24 gene have been associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.

## Function
The DHCR24 gene encodes a protein called 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase which plays a key role in cholesterol synthesis by catalyzing the reduction of desmosterol to cholesterol.
