# Genetic Information for Gene TAC3

## Genomic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genomic Position:** TAC3 gene is located on the chromosome 1 at region 1q43. It spans about 6.5 kb of DNA and contains 3 exons.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the TAC3 gene have been implicated in the development of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a disorder that is characterized by delayed puberty and infertility due to a lack of sex hormone production.
- **Function:** The TAC3 gene encodes a protein called neurokinin B (NKB) which belongs to a family of neuropeptides called tachykinins. NKB acts as an important regulator of reproductive function by affecting the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.

## Gene Information
- **Function:** Neurokinin B (NKB) precursor
- **Aliases:** TAC2, NKB, NKBN, HBK4
- **External IDs:**
  - HGNC: 11539
  - NCBI Entrez: 6870
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000143110
  - OMIM: 162330
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P0C0P6

## Mutations of TAC3 Gene
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:** Several variations of AA have been reported in TAC3 gene such as R16H and N50T substitution in exon 1, resulting in frame shift mutation, which is responsible for idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. 
- **dbSNP ID:** rs7968605, rs45401496, and rs7968613 are some of the dbSNPIDs associated with TAC3 gene mutations.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** There are no reports of somatic SNVs/InDels associated with TAC3 gene.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in TAC3 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of IHH is aimed at restoring fertility and sexual function. Gonadotropin therapy is often used to stimulate the production of sex hormones. Prognosis for infertility is generally good.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available regarding drug response of TAC3 gene.
