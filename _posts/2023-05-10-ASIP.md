# Gene: ASIP

## Information
- Function: ASIP (Agouti Signaling Protein) is involved in the regulation of pigmentation and energy homeostasis. It acts as an antagonist of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and blocks the production of eumelanin, which leads to the production of yellow and red pigments in hair, skin, and eyes. The protein also plays a role in the control of energy homeostasis by regulating the activity of adipocytes.
