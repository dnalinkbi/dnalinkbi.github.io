## Gene NUP98

### Genetic Position and Genomic Information
- Gene: Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98)
- Chromosome: 11
- Locus: 11p15.5
- Alias: NUP98NS, ADIR2, NUP98H
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 8038
    - NCBI Entrez: 4928
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000102054
    - OMIM: 601494
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P52948

### Function
NUP98 is a gene that codes for a nucleoporin protein, which helps to form the nuclear pore complex that regulates transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It has also been shown to have a role in chromosomal organization and gene expression.

### Related Disease
- Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
- Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML)
- Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)
- Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
- Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for NUP98-related leukemias and MDS usually involves chemotherapy and sometimes stem cell transplantation. Prognosis varies depending on many factors including age, type of leukemia, and other health conditions. 

### Drug Response
- Preclinical studies have suggested that inhibitors of the protein menin may be effective in treating NUP98-related leukemias. 
- Additionally, various chemotherapeutic drugs have been used to treat these diseases, although responses vary.
