# Genetic Information Analysis Report for Gene HOXD11

## Basic Information

- **Gene ID:** HOXD11
- **Gene location:** Chromosome 2p15-p14.1
- **Aliases:** HOX4, HOX4B

## Function for Gene

The HOXD11 gene encodes a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors. Homeobox genes are known to play crucial roles in regulating development processes including cell differentiation, pattern formation, and morphogenesis. The HOXD11 gene is involved in the formation and patterning of the limbs during embryonic development.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are some single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (InDels) reported in the HOXD11 gene. Here are a few examples:

- p.Gly204Cys missense variant (dbSNP ID: rs138288506)
- p.Arg176Cys missense variant (dbSNP ID: rs201637954)
- c.-69C>T single nucleotide variant (dbSNP ID: rs796789895)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in the HOXD11 gene are rare in cancer. However, there are a few reports of somatic SNVs and InDels in various types of cancers, including breast cancer and liver cancer. One example is:

- p.Val195Ile missense variant (dbSNP ID: rs77334730)

## Related Disease

The HOXD11 gene has been linked to several developmental disorders including:

- Hand-foot-genital syndrome
- Brachydactyly-syndactyly syndrome
- Polydactyly syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment or cure available for genetic disorders caused by mutations in the HOXD11 gene. Treatment is generally supportive and focuses on managing symptoms. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response

Currently, there are no approved drugs targeting the HOXD11 gene.
