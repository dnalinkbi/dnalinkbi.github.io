## Gene AGRP

- Function: The AGRP gene encodes for Agouti-related protein, which is a neuropeptide involved in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis.

- External IDs: 
  - Gene: AGRP
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 16, position 28.2-28.3
  - Aliases: AGRT, ART, AGRT1 

- External sites:
  - HGNC: 358
  - NCBI Entrez: 181
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000103090
  - OMIM: 602454
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00253

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
  - c.386G>A (p.Arg129His), rs200792967
  - c.227C>T (p.Gln76*), rs770882248
  
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - c.386G>A (p.Arg129His), rs200792967

- Related disease: AGRP mutations have been associated with early onset obesity and hyperphagia.

- Treatment and prognosis: AGRP mutations are rare and no specific treatment is available. Patients with AGRP mutations may benefit from lifestyle modifications and supportive care.

- Drug response: There are no known drugs that specifically target AGRP. However, drugs that target other neuropeptides involved in food intake regulation may potentially be beneficial.
