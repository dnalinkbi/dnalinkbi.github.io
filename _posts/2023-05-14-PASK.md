# Gene PASK

## Information
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 2 (NC_000002.12) 
- **Pathology**: PASK is associated with type 2 diabetes, regulation of glucose metabolism, obesity, and insulin sensitivity.  
- **Function for gene**: PASK encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a vital role in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, glucose-stimulated insulin gene transcription regulation, and pancreatic Î²-cell function.
- **External IDs**:     
    - HGNC ID: 21319
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 23198
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000115075
    - OMIM ID: 606512
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q86YC2
- **Aliases**: PAS domain-containing serine/threonine-protein kinase, PASKIN, STK37

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List**:
    - c.1198C>T (p.Arg400Ter)
    - c.667G>A (p.Arg223Gln)
    - c.773A>G (p.Glu258Gly)
    - c.802G>C (p.Glu268Gln)
- **Mutation Type**: Missense, Nonsense
- **dbSNP ID**: rs143237400, rs1556215, rs11021954, rs3753023

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No reported somatic mutations

## Related Disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Obesity
- Insulin resistance
- Metabolic syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Studies suggest that PASK inhibition could prevent hepatic glucose production and improve insulin sensitivity, indicating that PASK could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.
- Further research is needed to establish the significance of PASK as a drug target.

## Drug response
- No drugs have been approved to target PASK specifically.
