# Information about gene PAX6

## Genetic position

The PAX6 gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and has a length of about 22 kilobases. It spans from the base pair position 30,902,304 to 30,924,182.

## Pathology

Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been found to be associated with a variety of ocular disorders, such as aniridia (a congenital absence of the iris), Peters anomaly (a malformation of the eye that affects the cornea), and Foveal Hypoplasia (incomplete development of the eye's fovea).

## Function

The PAX6 gene is involved in the development of various tissues and organs, including the eye, brain, and pancreas. It is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the normal embryonic development of the eye and is necessary for the formation of normal ocular structures, such as the cornea, lens, and retina.

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for ocular disorders caused by PAX6 mutations varies with the specific condition. For example, treatment for aniridia may involve the use of contact lenses, glasses, or intraocular lenses to correct vision problems. Prognosis also varies depending on the condition and the severity of the mutations.

## Drug response

There are currently no drugs specifically designed to target PAX6 mutations. However, certain therapies, such as stem cell therapy, may hold promise for treating ocular disorders caused by these mutations in the future.
