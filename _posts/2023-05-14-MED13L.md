# Information about gene MED13L

## Genetic Position
The gene MED13L (Mediator Complex Subunit 13-Like) is located on chromosome 12q24.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in MED13L have been associated with intellectual disability, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and other neurological abnormalities. 

## Function
MED13L encodes a protein that is a component of the mediator complex, which acts as a transcriptional coactivator for RNA polymerase II.
