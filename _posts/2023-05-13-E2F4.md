# Information about Gene E2F4

## Genetic Position
The gene E2F4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q21) in humans.

## Pathology
Mutations or dysregulation of the E2F4 gene have been associated with several types of cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer.

## Function
The E2F4 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation. E2F4 binds to DNA and associates with other proteins to either activate or repress gene expression.

## External IDs

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported AA mutations in the E2F4 gene, including:
- p.Gly134Glu (rs774719298)
- p.Ser373Thr (rs113169176)
- p.Pro457Leu (rs201007661)

These mutations are missense mutations, which alter a single amino acid in the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several reported somatic mutations (SNVs and InDels) in the E2F4 gene, including:
- c.1340C>G (rs141087103)
- c.1424G>A (rs55883331)
- c.1608_1609insTC (rs758436650)

## Related Disease
Various types of cancer have been associated with E2F4 gene mutations, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
As of now, there is no targeted treatment available for E2F4 mutations. However, studies are ongoing to explore the potential of E2F4 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Drug Response
No specific information is available about the drug response of E2F4 mutations.
