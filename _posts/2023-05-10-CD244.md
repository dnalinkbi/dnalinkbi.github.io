## Gene CD244

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position**: CD244 is located on human chromosome 1p36.33. It spans 10,308 base pairs and consists of 7 exons.
- **Pathology**: CD244 is associated with various immune-mediated diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
- **Function**: CD244 is a cell surface receptor protein that plays a crucial role in regulating immune system function. It belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family of proteins and is expressed on various immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and some CD4+ T cells. CD244 binds to ligands on target cells and regulates the activation, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of immune cells.
