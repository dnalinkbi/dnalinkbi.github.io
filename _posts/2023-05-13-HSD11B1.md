# Gene Information: HSD11B1

## Information in brief:
- **Gene Name:** HSD11B1
- **Aliases:** 11-beta-HSD1, 11-beta-HSD type 1, HSD11, SRD5A1, DHRS1
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 1 (1q32.1)
- **External IDs:** 
  - HGNC: 5163 
  - NCBI Entrez Gene: 3290 
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000134200 
  - OMIM: 600713 
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P28845

## Function for gene:
The HSD11B1 gene encodes the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-beta-HSD1) enzyme, which is primarily involved in the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol in cells. This enzyme is primarily found in liver and adipose tissues.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- rs121912625: p.Arg329Cys (R329C) - Polymorphism 
- rs4845741: p.Arg456His (R456H) - Polymorphism 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- rs28591012: c.1258C>G (p.Phe420Leu) - Somatic variant
- rs201430505: c.371-326G>A - Somatic variant

## Related disease:
HSD11B1 mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with various diseases such as hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoporosis, depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline.

## Treatment and prognosis:
There is no specific treatment available for HSD11B1 gene mutations. However, some studies have suggested that targeting the activity of the 11-beta-HSD1 enzyme can be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases associated with HSD11B1 mutations.

## Drug response:
Some drugs such as carbenoxolone, glycyrrhetinic acid, and their derivatives are known inhibitors of 11-beta-HSD1 enzyme and have shown potential therapeutic effects in animal models and humans.
