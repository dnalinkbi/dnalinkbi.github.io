# Information about Gene CYP11A1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 15
- Start position: 74,001,886 bp
- End position: 74,037,249 bp

## Pathology 
- CYP11A1 is associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Mutations in this gene can cause 46,XX disorder of sex development (DSD) and adrenal insufficiency. 

## Function
- CYP11A1 (Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) is a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. It converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is a precursor for several other steroid hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens.

## Related Disease
- Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)
- Adrenocortical Insufficiency

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for CAH typically involves hormone replacement therapy.
- The prognosis for CAH depends on the severity of the disease and how early it is diagnosed and treated.

## Drug Response 
- No information found for drug response.
