## Gene CLRN1

- Function: The CLRN1 gene encodes a protein called clarin-1, which is found in the retina of the eye and is involved in the development and maintenance of sensory cells called hair cells.

- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 18577
    - NCBI Entrez: 7401
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000138379
    - OMIM: 606397
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UHD9

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: There are several reported variants in the CLRN1 gene, some of which include:
    - c.501T>C, p.Leu167Pro (rs766045097)
    - c.1044A>G, p.Ile348Val (rs139121186)
    - c.1111G>A, p.Ala371Thr (rs142065689)
    
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the CLRN1 gene.

- Related disease: Mutations in the CLRN1 gene are associated with a rare inherited disorder called Usher syndrome type III (USH3), which is characterized by progressive hearing loss and vision impairment.

- Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no known cure for Usher syndrome type III. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and may include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and vision aids. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

- Drug response: There is currently no known drug that targets CLRN1 specifically. However, various therapeutic approaches are being explored for treating Usher syndrome, including gene therapy and stem cell therapy.
