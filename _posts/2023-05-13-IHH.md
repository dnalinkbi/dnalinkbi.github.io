# Gene IHH

## Genetic Position and Function
The IHH (Indian hedgehog homolog) gene is located on chromosome 2q33.3 and encodes for a secreted protein that is a member of the hedgehog signaling pathway. The hedgehog signaling pathway plays an essential role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.

## Pathology and Related Disease
Mutations in the IHH gene have been associated with various skeletal dysplasias, including brachydactyly type A1, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by shortened fingers and toes. In addition, IHH mutations have been identified in patients with acrocapitofemoral dysplasia, a rare autosomal recessive skeletal disorder that affects bone growth and development.

## Function for Gene
The IHH protein plays a crucial role in bone growth and development, particularly in the regulation of endochondral ossification. It signals through the smoothened receptor and leads to the activation of the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) family of transcription factors.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known Somatic SNVs/ InDels for the IHH gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for skeletal dysplasias caused by IHH mutations. Treatment is typically symptomatic and focused on managing the specific symptoms and complications associated with the disorder.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to IHH mutation.
