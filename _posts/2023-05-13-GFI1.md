## Gene Information
- Gene: GFI1 
- Alias: ZNF163, Gfi-1B, Gfi1b, ZBP-89, KOX21
- Location: Chromosome 1q21.3
- Function: GFI1 encodes a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that plays a vital role in regulating hematopoiesis by controlling stem cell differentiation and maintaining immune cell homeostasis
