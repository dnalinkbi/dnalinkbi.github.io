## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** DOCK8

**Function:** DOCK8, also known as dedicator of cytokinesis protein 8, is a member of the DOCK family of atypical Rho GTPases regulators. It plays a crucial role in regulating the function of T and B lymphocytes, with an essential role in immune system function.

**Aliases:** DCDC2, DOCK8A, FCALC1, FLJ40569, KIAA0580  

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 3768
- NCBI Entrez: 81704
- Ensembl: ENSG00000205213
- OMIM: 611432
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NF50

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 9, 9p24.3

**Related Disease:** DOCK8 Deficiency: An autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent viral and bacterial infections, severe atopy, and an increased risk of malignancy.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, the only treatment for DOCK8 deficiency is bone marrow transplantation. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy can improve outcomes for those with DOCK8 deficiency.

**Drug response:** No drugs have been approved for the treatment of DOCK8 deficiency specifically.
