## Gene Information

**Gene:** UBIAD1

**Aliases:** TERE1, HEAB, CYP2B7

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1q42.2

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 17256
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 51669
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116791
- OMIM: 610066
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5Z9

**Function:** The UBIAD1 gene encodes a protein known as "ubiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein 1," which is involved in the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a molecule that is essential for mitochondrial function and energy production.

## Genetic Variations

**AA Mutation List:**

|AA Position|AA Change|dbSNP ID|Mutation Type|
|-----------|---------|--------|--------------|
|27|Ile to Thr|rs3812718|Missense|
|92|Met to Ile|rs140532|Missense|
|102|Val to Ile|rs12451551|Missense|
|121|Leu to Ile|rs61749084|Missense|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

No somatic mutations have been reported in UBIAD1.

## Pathology and Related Diseases

Mutations or dysregulation of the UBIAD1 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions including cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degeneration, and type 2 diabetes. A rare genetic disorder known as Schnyder corneal dystrophy is caused by mutations in the UBIAD1 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific disease or condition associated with UBIAD1 dysregulation. Some treatments for cardiovascular disease, such as statins, may indirectly affect CoQ10 levels.

## Drug Response

Certain drugs, such as statins, can affect CoQ10 levels in the body, which may have implications for drug response and side effects.
