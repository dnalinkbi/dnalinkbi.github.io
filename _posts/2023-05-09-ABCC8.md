##Gene Information

###Gene: ABCC8

- **Function:** The ABCC8 gene encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily of proteins, which plays a crucial role in regulating insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cells. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene can result in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia 1 (HH1), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by prolonged and recurrent severe hypoglycemia, particularly during fasting periods and stresses.
- **External IDs:** Gene ID: 6833, Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q13.1, Aliases: HI/KATP channel subunit SUR1, PHHI, SUR, TNDM2

###Mutation Information

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** The following is a list of some of the amino acid (AA) changes which have been reported in the ABCC8 gene, along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID where applicable:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S1191F | Missense | rs118203849 |
| V187D | Missense | rs587776767 |
| V222D | Missense | rs587776768 |
| R301Q | Missense | rs199473176 |
| G662S | Missense | rs199473170 |
| N540K | Missense | rs199473169 |
| R494W | Missense | rs199473168 |
	
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There is currently no known association of somatic SNVs/InDels in the ABCC8 gene.

###Related Diseases

- Mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
	- Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin secretion in the pancreas leading to recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), often beginning in infancy
	- Diabetes mellitus (DM), a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period of time
	
###Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia 1 (HH1) typically involves glucose infusion during hypoglycemic episodes, but may also involve the use of medications like Diazoxide, which helps to reduce insulin secretion.
- The prognosis for individuals with mild forms of HH1 is typically good, with resolution of symptoms during childhood. However, for those with severe forms of HH1, surgery may be required to remove a portion of the pancreas.

###Drug Response

- ABCC8 mutations have been shown to have variable responses to medical therapies, depending on the specific mutation and severity of the condition.
- Diazoxide, which helps to reduce insulin secretion, is commonly used to treat HH1. However, some ABCC8 mutations may be refractory to this therapy.

####Instructions
Write a brief report on the information about the ABCC8 gene. Provide an overview of the gene's function and known mutations, including amino acid changes and associated diseases. Also, include information about the external IDs and sites related to the ABCC8 gene. Lastly, explain the treatments/therapies and the prognosis for individuals with ABCC8 mutations, as well as drug response.
