# Information about Gene HAS3

## Gene Function
The HAS3 gene encodes an enzyme called hyaluronan synthase 3 which catalyzes the formation of a glycosaminoglycan called hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is involved in various biological processes such as tissue hydration, wound healing, and cell migration.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for tumors overexpressing HAS3 involves targeting hyaluronan synthesis with hyaluronidase or RNA interference which could potentially reduce tumor growth. However, further research is needed for the development of effective therapies. Prognosis and treatment may change depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug Response
There is no significant data on drug response related to HAS3 gene.
