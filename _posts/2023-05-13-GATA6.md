# Gene Information for GATA6

## Gene Position

- The GATA6 gene is located on chromosome 18q11.2.

## Gene Pathology and Function

- The GATA6 gene is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis and has been associated with various developmental disorders. It plays a role in the development of the heart, lungs, and pancreas.
- Mutations in the GATA6 gene have been linked to several diseases such as Diaphragmatic hernia, Atrioventricular septal defect, Biliary atresia with splenic malformation syndrome, and more.
