**Gene:** TNFRSF17

Function:
TNFRSF17 is a cytokine receptor that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It is also known as BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) and CD269. TNFRSF17 is primarily expressed in mature B cells and it plays a role in regulating the survival and differentiation of B cells. It binds to its ligands, including BAFF (B-cell activating factor), APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), and TALL-1 (TNF and TNFR-related protein). This interaction activates signaling pathways that promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.

AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

- No pathogenic variation is available for TNFRSF17.

Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

- No somatic mutations have been reported for TNFRSF17.

Related disease:
TNFRSF17 has been implicated in several autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. In addition, overexpression of TNFRSF17 has been observed in various types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and breast cancer.

Treatment and prognosis:
Several drugs that target TNFRSF17 are currently under investigation for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and cancer. For example, belimumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BAFF and blocks its interaction with TNFRSF17, is approved for the treatment of SLE. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted CAR T cell therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

Drug response:
Studies have shown that polymorphisms in the TNFRSF17 gene can affect the response to therapy in autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and SLE. In addition, the expression levels of TNFRSF17 have been used as a predictive marker for the response to certain cancer treatments.
