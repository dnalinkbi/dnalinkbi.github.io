## Gene KCNJ2

- **Function:** The KCNJ2 gene encodes a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family. This channel plays a crucial role in regulating potassium ionic currents across the plasma membrane of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, which is important for the maintenance of proper electrical signaling and normal heart function.

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 3767
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q24.3
    - Aliases: BIR1, HIR, IRK1, KATP1, LQT7, SQT3

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - A list of all known mutations in KCNJ2 can be found in the [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) database. Some examples of disease-causing mutations in KCNJ2 with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:
        - R67W (rs199473051)
        - G80R (rs199473052)
        - D172N (rs199472669)
        - V93I (rs199472822)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - For information on somatic mutations in KCNJ2, see the [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) database.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in KCNJ2 have been associated with several cardiac disorders, including:
    - Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS)
    - Short QT Syndrome (SQTS)
    - Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment strategies for KCNJ2-associated disorders vary depending on the specific condition. In some cases, beta blockers and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) may be recommended. Prognosis also varies by condition and individual patient factors.

- **Drug Response:** There is limited information on drug response in patients with KCNJ2-associated disorders. Some studies have suggested that beta blockers may be less effective in patients with SQTS, while sodium channel blockers may be more effective.
