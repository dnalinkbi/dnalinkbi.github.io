# Information about Gene DOK1

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Position**: Chromosome 2q33.1
- **Pathology**: DOK1 mutations have been linked to several types of cancer, including breast and lung cancer.
- **Function**: DOK1 encodes for a docking protein that plays a role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways. It is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It also acts as a negative regulator of various tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor.
