# Gene HOXA13

## Genetic Position
* Chromosome: 7
* Location: 7p15.2
* Strand: Plus
* Alias: HOX1, HOX1E 

## Function
The HOXA13 gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in limb development and patterning. It belongs to the HOX gene family that plays a crucial role in embryonic development and differentiation. HOXA13 is responsible for the proper formation of fingers, toes, and genitalia during development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
No significant somatic structural variations have been reported for the HOXA13 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HOXA13 gene cause a rare genetic disorder called hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and affects the development of hands, feet, and genitalia.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for hand-foot-genital syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Regular monitoring of patients is mandatory to detect and manage complications early.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug for this syndrome; treatments may involve anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics, and steroid injections.
