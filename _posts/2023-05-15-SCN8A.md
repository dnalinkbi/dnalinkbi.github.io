## Gene SCN8A

### Genetic Position and Pathology

- SCN8A is located on chromosome 12 (12q13.3).
- Mutations in SCN8A have been associated with various neurological disorders such as:
    - Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIEE)
    - Intellectual Disability
    - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- SCN8A mutations can lead to both gain-of-function and loss-of-function effects on the sodium channel resulting in changes in neuronal excitability.

### Function for Gene

- SCN8A encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, which is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and plays a critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons.

### External IDs and Aliases

- External IDs: HGNC:10589, NCBI Entrez: 6334, Ensembl: ENSG00000118046, OMIM: 600702, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UQD0
- Aliases: Nav1.6, NAC1, PN1

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There is no information available on somatic mutations in SCN8A.

### Related Disease

- SCN8A mutations have been associated with various neurological disorders such as:
    - Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIEE)
    - Intellectual Disability
    - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for diseases associated with SCN8A mutations are largely supportive and symptomatic, as there are no targeted therapies available.
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and resulting clinical features.

### Drug Response

- There is currently no information available on drug response in individuals with SCN8A mutations.
