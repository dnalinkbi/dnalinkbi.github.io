# Gene Information for WRAP53

## Gene Location and Aliases

**Gene Name:** WRAP53

**Chromosome Location:** 17q12

**Aliases:** WDR79, TCAB1

## Gene Function
The WRAP53 gene encodes for the WD repeat containing protein 79 (WDR79), also known as the telomerase Cajal body protein 1 (TCAB1). TCAB1 is important in the assembly of Cajal bodies, which are nuclear structures involved in the maturation and processing of small nuclear RNAs.
