## IL1B Gene Information
The IL1B (Interleukin 1 Beta) gene is located on chromosome 2q14 and encodes for a pro-inflammatory cytokine protein. It is involved in the immune response and plays a role in various pathways such as inflammation, cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.

### Function
The IL1B gene produces a cytokine protein that activates the immune system in response to infection, injury, or stress. It also plays a role in various diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory disorders.

### Mutation Information
- AA Mutation List: The IL1B gene has several reported amino acid mutations that can result in altered protein function. These include:
    - p.Asp20Asn (rs1143634)
    - p.Val117Met (rs1143633)
    - p.Ser38Ala (rs16944)
- Mutation Type: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
- dbSNP ID: rs1143634, rs1143633, rs16944

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: There are several reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the IL1B gene. However, there is no database available for somatic mutations currently.
 
### Related Diseases
The IL1B gene has been associated with various diseases and conditions including:
- Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease
- Cancer
- Alzheimer's Disease
- Periodontitis

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment or prognosis related to IL1B gene mutations. However, some drugs that target IL1B are currently being used to treat certain inflammatory disorders.

### Drug Response
Several drugs have been developed that target the IL1B protein, including:
- Anakinra (Kineret)
- Canakinumab (Ilaris)
- Rilonacept (Arcalyst)
