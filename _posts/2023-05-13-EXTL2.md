# Information about gene EXTL2

## Genetic Position
- Gene symbol: EXTL2
- Genomic location: Chromosome 1 (1p36.11)
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): 34,013,326 - 34,048,551

## Pathology and Function
- Function: EXTL2 encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which are both glycosaminoglycans that play important roles in cell signaling and communication.
- Pathology: Variations in EXTL2 have been associated with various diseases including multiple synostoses syndrome, osteoarthritis, and prostate cancer.

## Related Disease
- Multiple synostoses syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects skeletal development, causing fused joints among other symptoms.
- Osteoarthritis: EXTL2 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects millions of people worldwide.
- Prostate cancer: Variations in EXTL2 have been associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no targeted treatments for diseases caused by variations in EXTL2. Treatment and prognosis for patients with multiple synostoses syndrome and osteoarthritis depend on various factors, including the severity of symptoms and the presence of other medical conditions. Treatment for prostate cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy depending on the stage of the cancer.
