## Information about gene MSMO1:

### Pathology
MSMO1, also known as Methylsterol monooxygenase 1, is associated with cholesterol biosynthesis, conversion of dietary sterols and biosynthesis of steroid hormones. Mutations or dysregulation of MSMO1 can lead to diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and metabolic disorders.

### Function
MSMO1 is a member of the P450 family and is involved in the oxidation of the carbon-carbon double bond present in sterols. This gene is responsible for the conversion of methylsterol to +Î”7-cholesterol, which is a crucial step in the production of cholesterol.
