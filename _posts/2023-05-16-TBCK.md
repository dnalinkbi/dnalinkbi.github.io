- Function: TBCK encodes the TBCK kinase, which is known to regulate cellular processes such as mRNA splicing, cell division, and cell migration.
- Genomic location: Chromosome 4q24-q25
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 27186
    - NCBI Entrez: 23085
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000138691
    - OMIM: 616850
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86U86
- Aliases: TBC1 domain containing kinase
