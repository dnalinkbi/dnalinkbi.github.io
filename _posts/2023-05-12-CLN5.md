## Information about Gene CLN5

### Genetic Position

Gene CLN5 is located on chromosome 13q22.3 and spans about 35,109 bases.

### Pathology

CLN5 is a gene that codes for a transmembrane protein that is involved in lysosomal function. Pathogenic variants in this gene lead to defects in lysosomal function, which results in the accumulation of proteins and lipids inside lysosomes. These accumulations lead to neurodegenerative diseases known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), which are also referred to as Batten disease.

### Function

The CLN5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the transport of proteins and lipids into lysosomes for degradation. The protein also regulates calcium homeostasis within lysosomes. Lysosomes are organelles responsible for breaking down cellular waste, including proteins and lipids.

- rs1588188965 with an A to C substitution
- rs1487094139 with a T to A substitution
- rs1595190155 with a G to A substitution

### Related Disease

Pathogenic variants in CLN5 result in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 5 (CLN5 NCL), which is a neurological disorder that affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain to function properly. This disorder typically begins in childhood and progresses over time, leading to blindness, seizures, movement problems, and dementia.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for CLN5 NCL, and the treatment options are mainly focused on managing the symptoms associated with the disorder. The prognosis for this disorder is poor, and most individuals with CLN5 NCL will have a shortened lifespan.

### Drug Response

There is currently no approved drug therapy for CLN5 NCL. However, there are several experimental therapies under investigation, including gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy.
