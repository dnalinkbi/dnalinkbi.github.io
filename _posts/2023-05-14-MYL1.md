### Gene: MYL1

- Function: MYL1 (Myosin Light Chain 1) encodes a protein that is involved in muscle contraction by functioning as a calcium-binding subunit of myosin. It is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a crucial role in muscle contraction.

- External IDs: HGNC:7560, NCBI Entrez:4635, Ensembl:ENSG00000106631, OMIM:160781, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P05976

- Aliases: MLC1SA, MLC1SB, MLC1SM, MLC3NM, MLC3SA, MLC3SB, MLC3SC, MLC3SM

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: Some of the amino acid (AA) mutations reported in MYL1 gene are:
  - p.Ala53Ser, Missense, rs1048101
  - p.Leu58Pro, Missense, rs1048102
  - p.Asp140Asn, Missense, rs200763375
  - p.Thr149Met, Missense, rs1048103

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: There are several somatic SNVs/InDels (Single Nucleotide Variations/Insertions and Deletions) reported in MYL1 gene with dbSNP IDs, some of them are:
  - rs863223033
  - rs148717456
  - rs764605723
  - rs750130176

- Related disease: Mutations in MYL1 gene are associated with multiple diseases such as primary hypogonadism, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and inclusion body myositis.

- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with MYL1 gene mutations depend on the specific disease and the nature of the mutation. Genetic counseling and symptomatic treatment are the typical approaches for most of these diseases.

- Drug response: There is currently no specific drug available to target MYL1 gene mutations, but research is ongoing to develop targeted therapies.
