# Gene IL10 

## Genomic information
- Gene symbol: IL10
- Gene ID: 3586
- Chromosome location: 1q32.1
- Aliases: CSIF, GVHDS, IL-10, TGIF

## Function
The interleukin 10 (IL-10) gene encodes a cytokine that plays an important role in immune regulation. IL-10 is produced mainly by immune cells such as macrophages, T-cells, and B-cells. It acts on various immune cells to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 itself. This anti-inflammatory function of IL-10 helps to prevent excessive immune responses that could lead to tissue damage.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported for the IL10 gene. Here is a list of some common ones:

| AA change | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| :-------:|:------------:| :-------:|
| Gln98Leu | Missense     | rs1800896|
| Ala114Thr| Missense     | rs1800890|
| Asp95Ala | Missense     | rs3024505|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs/InDels are also reported for the IL10 gene in various cancers. Here is a list of some common ones:

| Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
|:------------:| :-------:|
|SNV           | rs1800871|
|InDel         | rs12103337|
|SNV           | rs3024495|

## Related disease
The IL10 gene has been implicated in various diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer. Some of the diseases associated with IL-10 are:
- Multiple sclerosis
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Asthma
- Cancer

## Treatment and prognosis
The role of IL-10 in disease pathogenesis is complex, and its therapeutic potential varies depending on the disease. In some cases, treatment with IL-10 or IL-10 agonists can be beneficial for reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair. However, in other cases, IL-10 blockade could be more effective for enhancing immune responses against cancer cells.

## Drug response
IL-10-targeted therapies are under clinical investigation for various diseases. For example, a humanized anti-IL-10R monoclonal antibody, called BMS-986256, is being evaluated for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and cancer.
