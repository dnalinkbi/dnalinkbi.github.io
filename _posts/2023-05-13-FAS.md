# Gene FAS

## Information Summary

**Gene Name:** FAS

**Aliases:** CD95, APT1, FAS1

**External IDs and Genomic Location:** 
- HGNC: 11925
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 355
- Ensembl: ENSG00000026103
- OMIM: 134637
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P25445

**Function:** FAS is a cell surface protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. It plays a vital role in apoptosis, and its signaling pathway contributes to immune system regulation and efferocytosis.  

**Associated Pathology:** Mutations in the FAS gene have been linked to various autoimmune and immunodeficiency syndromes, such as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Ala230Val (rs1800682)
- p.Ala307Ser (rs1800683)
- p.Cys194Arg (rs361525)
- p.Cys193Ser (rs1800684)
- p.Cys276Tyr (rs1800685)
- p.Gly279Asp (rs1258763)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs1800686
- rs75740779
- rs267607145

**Related Disease:** Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, mevalonic aciduria, and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome. 

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for ALPS includes immunosuppressive therapy, lymphocytapheresis, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The prognosis for ALPS varies depending on the severity and duration of the disease. 

**Drug Response:** FAS is a target in cancer therapy, and there are drugs targeting FAS receptor and its signaling pathway. Currently, there are several clinical trials investigating FAS agonists and antagonists in cancer therapy.
