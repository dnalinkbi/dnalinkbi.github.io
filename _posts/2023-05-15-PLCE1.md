## Gene: PLCE1

- Function: Plays a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, including calcium signaling and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. It acts as a signal transducer for G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.

- Related disease: 
    - Autosomal recessive disorders associated with mutations in the PLCE1 gene include nephrotic syndrome type 3.

- Treatment and prognosis:
    - Treatment typically involves the management of symptoms, such as proteinuria and edema, and the prevention of complications such as infections and thromboembolism. In severe cases, kidney transplantation may be required.
    - Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and response to treatment.

- Drug response: 
    - Currently, there is no specific drug treatment for nephrotic syndrome type 3 associated with mutations in the PLCE1 gene.
