# Information about Gene ICAM1

## Genetic Position
ICAM1 is located on the **chromosome 19** at the genetic position **p13.2**.

## Pathology
ICAM1 gene is associated with **inflammation**, **infection**, and **cancer**.

## Function for gene
ICAM1 encodes for a cell surface glycoprotein that's involved in **cell adhesion** and **cell signaling**. ICAM1 plays a major role in the immune response as it binds to its receptor, LFA-1, on T-cells and leukocytes, and facilitates their migration to the site of inflammation. ICAM1 also serves as a receptor for some pathogens.
