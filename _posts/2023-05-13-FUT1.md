# Gene: FUT1

## Genetic Position
The FUT1 gene is located on chromosome 19 and spans roughly 8.71 kilobases of DNA.

## Pathology
The FUT1 gene encodes for an enzyme called alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase, which adds a fucose sugar molecule to other sugars and proteins. Defects in this gene can result in the lack of expression of the H antigen on red blood cells, which is associated with the rare Bombay blood group phenotype.

## Function
The FUT1 gene encodes for the alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase enzyme, which adds a fucose sugar molecule to other sugars and proteins. It plays a crucial role in the production of the H antigen on red blood cells.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for the genetic defects that affect the FUT1 gene. Patients with the Bombay phenotype typically do not require any special treatment unless they require blood transfusions. 

## Drug Response
Not applicable
