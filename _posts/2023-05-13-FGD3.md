# Information about Gene FGD3
## Genetic Position
- FGD3 gene is located on chromosome 1, position 1p36.33.

## Pathology and Function
- FGD3 gene encodes for a protein that acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). 
- It plays a crucial role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell migration, and cell adhesion.
- FGD3 has been implicated in developmental disorders such as mental retardation, craniofacial defects, and abnormal brain development.
- Studies have shown that FGD3 also plays a role in cancer progression and metastasis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic SNVs/InDels in FGD3 gene have been reported in various types of cancer, such as breast, colon, and lung cancer. 
- Some of the common somatic mutations in FGD3 gene are:
   - c.2578C>T (rs764380088)
   - c.2951G>A (rs774711525)
   - c.2986A>G (rs770413914)

## Related Disease
- Mutations in FGD3 gene have been associated with developmental disorders such as 
    - 3-M syndrome 2 
    - Neuropathy, Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic, Type VI
- Studies have also shown that FGD3 gene is involved in 
    - Cancer progression and metastasis 
    - Neurodegenerative disorders 
    - Cardiovascular diseases 

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment available for FGD3 gene-related disorders.
- The prognosis and treatment of FGD3-associated disorders depend on the specific manifestation and severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is no known specific drug that targets FGD3 gene, but targeting the downstream signaling pathways may be useful in the treatment of disorders associated with FGD3.
