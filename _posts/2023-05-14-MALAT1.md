# Information about gene MALAT1

## Genetic Position
The gene MALAT1 (also known as NEAT2) is located on chromosome 11q13.1. It spans a genomic region of approximately 8 kb and consists of 23 exons.

## Pathology
MALAT1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. In particular, overexpression of MALAT1 has been observed in various cancer types and is associated with poor prognosis.

## Function
MALAT1 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that plays a role in several cellular processes, including splicing regulation, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. It has also been linked to the regulation of alternative splicing and metastasis in cancer cells.

- OMIM: 611974
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: A0FGR8
- Aliases: NEAT2, PRO2853

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported missense mutations in MALAT1, including:
- c.2644C>T (p.Pro882Ser) rs2235875
- c.2744C>T (p.Ala915Val) rs2235876
However, their functional significance is not well understood.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations have been identified in MALAT1 in cancer samples, including:
- c.3190G>A (p.Glu1064Lys) rs730882085
- c.545G>A (p.Glu182Lys) rs104894803

## Related Diseases
MALAT1 has been implicated in several diseases, including:
- Cancer (breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, etc.)
- Cardiovascular Disease
- Neurological Disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting MALAT1 is a potential strategy for cancer therapy, and several studies have shown promising results in preclinical models. However, further research is needed to determine its efficacy and safety in humans. MALAT1 expression levels have also been shown to be a prognostic indicator for disease outcome in cancer patients.

## Drug Response
There is limited information regarding drug response related to MALAT1.
