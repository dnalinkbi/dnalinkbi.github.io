## Related Diseases

- KYNU has been associated with various diseases, including:
    - Schizophrenia: A study found that KYNU expression was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls.
    - Alzheimer's disease: A study found that decreased KYNU activity was associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
    
## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no specific treatment for KYNU-related diseases at this time.
- Prognosis varies depending on the disease and individual factors.

## Drug Response
