## Gene: MLLT6

### Genetic Position
- MLLT6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q27.2).

### Pathology and Function for Gene
- MLLT6 encodes a protein called AF17, which is a transcriptional coactivator and is involved in the regulation of gene expression.
- Aberrations in MLLT6 have been associated with various types of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and breast cancer.
