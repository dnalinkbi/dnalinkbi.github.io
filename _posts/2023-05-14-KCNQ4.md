## Gene Information for KCNQ4 Gene

### Genetic Position
- Chromosomal Location: 1p34.2
- Gene ID: 9132
- Genomic Coordinates: NC_000001.11|chr1:42573225-42691551
- Other aliases: DFNA2, DFNA2A, Kv7.4, KVLQT4

### Function
- KCNQ4 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium ion channel which plays a critical role in maintaining the function of hair cells in the inner ear. It is essential for the regulation of the potassium ion flow in the membrane of hair cells and helps in the proper functioning of the auditory pathway.
- This gene is involved in the formation of tinnitus, which is a recurring perception of sound in the absence of an acoustic stimulus.

### Related Diseases
- DFNA2 (Deafness, autosomal dominant 2) - caused by mutations in the KCNQ4 gene.
- DFNB2 (Deafness, autosomal recessive 2) - caused by mutations in the DFNB2A gene which is closely related to KCNQ4.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for hearing loss caused by DFNA2 and DFNB2.
- Cochlear implants and hearing aids can be used for treating hearing impairment.

### Drug Response
- No drug therapies are available for hearing loss caused by KCNQ4 gene mutations.
