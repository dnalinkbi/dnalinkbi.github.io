## Gene RFC2 information

### Genetic position
RFC2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 at position 13.33. 

### Pathology
Variations in RFC2 have been associated with different types of cancer such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. RFC2 mutations have also been related to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Function
RFC2 encodes for a protein that is part of the Replication Factor C (RFC) complex. This complex is involved in DNA replication and repair by catalyzing the loading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA. PCNA acts as a clamp that enhances the processivity of DNA polymerases during replication.
