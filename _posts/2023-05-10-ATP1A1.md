# ATP1A1 Gene Information

## Genetic Position
- Gene: ATP1A1
- Chromosome: 1 
- Location: 1q23.3 
- Strand: Plus 

## Pathology
Mutations in ATP1A1 gene are associated with various diseases including familial hemiplegic migraine, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism.

## Function
The ATP1A1 gene encodes a protein called Na+/K+ transporting ATPase alpha-1 subunit. This protein is involved in maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane, which is important for many physiological processes including cardiac muscle contraction, neural transmission, and kidney function.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not available

## Related Disease
- Familial hemiplegic migraine
- Alternating hemiplegia of childhood
- Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for diseases caused by ATP1A1 mutations. Treatment can only manage symptoms. The prognosis for patients varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response
- Quetiapine has been reported to improve symptoms in some patients with rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism caused by ATP1A1 mutations.
- Flunarizine has been shown to be effective in preventing attacks of hemiplegic migraine caused by ATP1A1 mutations.
