## Gene Information

**Gene:** CARD11

**Function of the gene:** The CARD11 gene encodes a protein primarily responsible for the regulation of immune cell activation and development. It is involved in the formation of a protein complex that activates a cellular signaling pathway, leading to the production of cytokines (molecules involved in immune response) and immunoglobulins (antibodies). 

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, aliases:** 

- **HGNC ID:** 13829
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 84433
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000162441
- **OMIM ID:** 607210
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9BXL7

**Genomic location (GRCh38):** Chromosome 7q34

**Aliases:** CARMA1, BIMP3, IMD12, MTB, CARD11L, hRIP2-ICC, RDD, CARM11

## Mutation Information

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are various AA mutations reported in the CARD11 gene. Some of the notable ones are:

- p.Cys49Tyr (rs199947090)
- p.Glu54Lys (rs61810824)
- p.Gln175* (rs387906281)
- p.Trp174Arg (rs587780983)

These mutations are mainly missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. They are reported in the dbSNP database with the indicated rsIDs.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the CARD11 gene. Some of them are:

- rs774753513
- rs72930277
- rs312262933

These mutations are reported in the dbSNP database with the indicated rsIDs.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CARD11 gene are associated with various immune disorders such as:

- Immunodeficiency 11 (IMD11)
- B cell lymphoma

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for patients with mutations in the CARD11 gene can vary depending on the severity of the disease. Patients with IMD11 may require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with B cell lymphoma may require chemotherapy, radiation therapy or stem cell transplantation. 

## Drug Response

There is no specific drug response information available for mutations in the CARD11 gene.
