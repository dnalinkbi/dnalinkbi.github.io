## Gene SMOC1

### Genetic Position
* **Chromosome:** 14
* **Genomic Coordinates:** GRCh38: 14q24.2
* **Transcription Start Site (TSS):** 74,837,719 bp
* **Transcription End Site (TES):** 74,936,798 bp

### Pathology 
Mutations in the SMOC1 gene have been associated with Liver Fibrosis, Renal Fibrosis, Marfan Syndrome and Asthma.

### Function
The SMOC1 gene encodes for a member of the BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin family of proteins. SMOC1 protein is involved in extracellular matrix synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, and tissue remodeling.
