# Gene: SLC2A10

SLC2A10 is a gene that is located on chromosome 20q13.12 and produces the protein glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). This protein is responsible for transporting glucose across the cell membrane in various types of cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells.

### Function
The primary function of SLC2A10 is to regulate glucose homeostasis in the body by facilitating glucose transport across the cell membrane. It is expressed in various types of tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations listed in the dbSNP database associated with SLC2A10. Some of the most notable are:

- p.Arg93Cys: rs61752722
- p.Ile157Thr: rs121912580
- p.His256Arg: rs121912581
- p.Arg303His: rs121912582

The mutation type for all of these is missense, which means that a single nucleotide change results in a different AA being inserted into the protein sequence.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels associated with SLC2A10 listed in the COSMIC database. Some notable examples include:

- c.1972C>T: COSM9557701
- c.121G>A: COSM2705998
- c.1706G>A: COSM9557138

Each of these SNVs results in a different AA being inserted into the protein sequence.

### Related Diseases
SLC2A10 mutations have been associated with several diseases, including arterial tortuosity syndrome, early-onset familial atherosclerosis, and preeclampsia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options and prognosis for diseases associated with SLC2A10 mutations vary depending on the specific condition. In general, treatment may involve managing symptoms and preventing complications. Early detection and management may improve long-term outcomes.

### Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to SLC2A10 mutations.
