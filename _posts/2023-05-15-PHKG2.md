# Information about gene PHKG2

## Genetic Position
- The PHKG2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 16 at position 12.2.
- It spans about 12.3 kilobases and contains 17 exons.

## Pathology
- Mutations in the PHKG2 gene have been associated with liver glycogen storage disease.
- The disease is characterized by low levels of the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the liver.
- This can cause hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

## Function for gene
- The PHKG2 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the liver form of the glycogen phosphorylase kinase enzyme.
- This enzyme is involved in the regulation of glycogen breakdown in the liver.

## External IDs
- Gene ID: 5261
- Genomic location: NC_000016.10 (25397791..25410248)
- Aliases: PHKgamma, PHKG

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.1970G>A - p.Arg657Gln (rs61731608)
- c.1043C>T - p.Ala348Val (rs61731607)
- c.836A>G - p.Glu279Gly (rs2079074)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the PHKG2 gene.

## Related disease
- Liver glycogen storage disease (OMIM #610455)

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment options for liver glycogen storage disease include dietary modifications and liver transplantation.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and how early it is diagnosed.

## Drug response
- There is limited information on drug response in relation to PHKG2 mutations.
