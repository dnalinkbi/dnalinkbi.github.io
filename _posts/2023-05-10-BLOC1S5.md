# Gene BLOC1S5

## Information
Gene BLOC1S5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 at position 6q24.2. It is also known as biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex-1, subunit 5 (BLOC1S5). The gene has an external ID of HGNC:10278 and NCBI Entrez Gene: 90627. It has aliases such as BLOS5, BLOC1S5, KIAA1775, and MGC26519.

## Function
BLOC1S5 is a subunit of BLOC-1 which plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. It is involved in protein trafficking, especially for cargo transport from endosomes to different organelles.

## Mutations
There are various mutations present in the BLOC1S5 gene. Some of the well-known AA mutations in the gene are Gly200Arg, Cys382Phe, and Ser407Thr. These mutations are linked with the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 9 (HPS-9) and cause defects in organelle formation and trafficking. The dbSNP IDs for these mutations are rs61752861, rs114425632, and rs113993934, respectively.

## Related Diseases
BLOC1S5 mutations are associated with some genetic disorders, including Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and pulmonary fibrosis. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 9. The treatment of this disease is focused on managing the symptoms of bleeding and respiratory issues. The prognosis of this syndrome is difficult to predict due to its complexity and rarity.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs available that specifically target the BLOC1S5 gene or its related disorders.
