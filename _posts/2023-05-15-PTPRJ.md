# Gene: PTPRJ

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11p11.2

## Pathology
PTPRJ gene is involved in various pathologies such as certain types of cancer, including colon, lung, and ovarian cancer.

## Function
PTPRJ (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type J) encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase and is involved in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, cell adhesion, and cell-cell communication.
