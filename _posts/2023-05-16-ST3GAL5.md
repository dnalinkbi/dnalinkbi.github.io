## Information about Gene ST3GAL5

### Genetic Position

- Gene: ST3GAL5
- Genomic Location: 2p11.2
- Chromosome: 2
- Arm: p
- Band: 11.2

### Pathology

- Gene ST3GAL5 is associated with the pathology of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.
- ST3GAL5 is suggested to play a role in tumor growth and metastasis.

### Function

- ST3GAL5 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of gangliosides.
- Gangliosides are a type of glycosphingolipid found on the surface of cells and play a role in cell communication, adhesion, and signaling.
- ST3GAL5 is involved in the biosynthesis of several types of gangliosides, including GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b.

### External IDs and Aliases

- External IDs: HGNC:11305, NCBI Entrez:6480, Ensembl: ENSG00000163910, OMIM:600568
- Aliases: SIAT9, sialyltransferase 9, GD1alpha synthase

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- No amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for gene ST3GAL5 in dbSNP (build 155).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Somatic mutations in gene ST3GAL5 have been reported in several cancer types including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in dbSNP (build 155).

### Related Disease

- Breast cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Colorectal cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

- ST3GAL5 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment as it is suggested to play a role in tumor growth and metastasis.
- However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of targeting ST3GAL5 for cancer treatment.

### Drug Response

- No drugs have been approved specifically targeting ST3GAL5.
- However, several drugs targeting gangliosides are currently in clinical trials for various cancer types.
