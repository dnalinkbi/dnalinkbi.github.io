## Gene Information
**Gene Name:** PAK3 - p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 3

### Function
PAK3 gene codes for a protein called p21-activated kinase 3, which is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and apoptosis.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000100526
- OMIM ID: 300142
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O75914

### Genomic Location
The PAK3 gene is located on chromosome Xq 23.

### Aliases
- MRX30 (Mental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic 30)
- RP11-1224M8.1

### AA Mutation List
| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There is currently no available information on somatic SNVs/InDels in PAK3 gene.

### Disease
Mutations in the PAK3 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), including non-specific intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and developmental delay. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for intellectual disability caused by PAK3 mutations. However, early interventions and therapies can improve a patient's quality of life.

### Drug Response
There is no available information on drug response related to PAK3 mutations.
