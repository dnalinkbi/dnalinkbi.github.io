## Gene Information: USH1E

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 21: 46,362,902 - 46,381,728

**Function:** The USH1E gene encodes a protein called ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1A (UBL1A), which is believed to play a role in the maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the eye.

**Related Disease:** Usher syndrome type 1E (USH1E), which is a rare genetic disorder that affects both hearing and vision.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for Usher syndrome type 1E, and treatment options are limited. Hearing aids, cochlear implants, and communication therapy may be used to manage hearing loss, while vision loss may require the use of low-vision aids, such as magnifying lenses or night-vision devices. The prognosis for individuals with Usher syndrome type 1E varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no known drug treatments for Usher syndrome type 1E.
