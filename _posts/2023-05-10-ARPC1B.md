## **Gene:** ARPC1B

**Genetic Position:** The ARPC1B gene is located on chromosome 7 at position q22.1.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the ARPC1B gene are associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) which is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disorder that affects multiple systems in the body. Patients with WAS have increased risk of developing infections, eczema, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies.

**Function for gene:** The ARPC1B gene encodes a subunit of the Arp2/3 protein complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization. 

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
- HGNC: 706

- Ensembl: ENSG00000106211
- OMIM: 602851
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15145
- Alias: ARC41, p41-ARC

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- c.127A>G (p.Ile43Val); rs61732513
- c.86C>T (p.Arg29Trp); rs775981117

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Related Disease:** Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The prognosis for patients with WAS is usually poor, however, the disease severity can vary widely from patient to patient. 

**Drug Response:** There is currently no drug specifically approved for the treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome however, some therapies like immunoglobulin replacement, prophylactic antibiotics, and antivirals can help in managing the symptoms of the disease.
