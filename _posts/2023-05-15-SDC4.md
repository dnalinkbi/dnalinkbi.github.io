# Gene SDC4

## Genetic Position
The gene SDC4 is located at the chromosome 20q13.12 region.

## Pathology
Different studies have suggested that mutations in the gene SDC4 can be related to several types of cancers, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bladder cancer. Moreover, it has been reported that the overexpression of SDC4 is significantly associated with a poor prognosis in some cancer types.

## Function
The gene SDC4 encodes for syndecan-4, a transmembrane proteoglycans involved in the extracellular matrix composition, cell adhesion, and signal transduction.
