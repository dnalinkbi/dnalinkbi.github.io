## Gene: SARS2

### Function
SARS2 gene encodes an RNA processing enzyme that plays an essential role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It processes the 5'-end of the RNA precursor of mitochondrial leucine tRNA and cleaves RNA molecules at specific sites during maturation of mitochondrial mRNAs.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for SARS2 gene.

### Related diseases
Mutations in the SARS2 gene have been linked to Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate (LTBL).

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for LTBL caused by SARS2 mutations. Treatment is supportive and includes physical and occupational therapy, gastrostomy tube placement for feeding difficulties, and management of seizures.

### Drug response
No drug response or targeted therapies have been developed for SARS2 mutations.
