# Information about Gene MAN1A2
## Genetic Position
The MAN1A2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q24.2). It spans 38,205 base pairs and is oriented in the forward direction.

## Pathology and Function
The MAN1A2 gene encodes for an alpha-mannosidase enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. The enzyme is responsible for cleaving alpha-linked mannose residues from glycoproteins. The encoded protein is primarily expressed in the liver, however, it is also expressed in other tissues including the spleen, brain, and kidney.

## Related Diseases
Altered MAN1A2 activity has been associated with several disorders including:
- Congenital disorders of glycosylation
- Liver cirrhosis
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for diseases caused by mutations in the MAN1A2 gene, however, treatment for symptoms and complications may be available. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available regarding drug response for MAN1A2-related disorders.
