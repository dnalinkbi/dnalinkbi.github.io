# Information about Gene KCNQ2
## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Position:** KCNQ2 is located on chromosome 20 at position p13.3
- **Pathology:** Mutations in KCNQ2 gene have been associated with rare diseases called the epileptic encephalopathies. 
- **Function:** The KCNQ2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2. This protein is involved in the transport of potassium ions across cell membranes. It plays a critical role in the stabilization of neuronal excitability, which makes it important for the function of the nervous system.

## Additional Information
- **Function for Gene:** The KCNQ2 gene codes for the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2 protein, which helps to regulate the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes in neurons.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations or variation in the KCNQ2 gene can cause benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS), early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), or other rare epileptic encephalopathies.
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment of the seizures due to KCNQ2 mutations includes medications like anti-seizure medications, such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or valproic acid. The prognosis varies depending on which specific mutation is present. 
    
- **Drug Response:** Some antiepileptic medications, such as phenobarbital and retigabine, have been found to be effective in treating seizures associated with KCNQ2 mutations.
