# Information on Gene DRD3

## Gene Information
- Function: The DRD3 gene encodes a dopamine receptor and is involved in the regulation of dopamine-mediated behaviors such as motivation and reward. It plays a role in the dopaminergic system, which has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorder.

    - HGNC:2925
    - NCBI Entrez:1814
    - Ensembl:ENSG00000121889
    - OMIM:126451
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P35462
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 3q13.3-q23
- Aliases: D3DR, DRD3R, ETM1

## Mutations and Variations
- AA mutations: The DRD3 gene has various point mutations that result in amino acid changes. Some examples include:
    - A9G (rs6280)
    - Ser9Gly (rs6283)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: There are various somatic single nucleotide variations and insertions/deletions recorded in the DRD3 gene. Some examples include:
    - rs12175676
    - rs12578055

## Related Diseases
- SCHIZOPHRENIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO (SCZD): The DRD3 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to schizophrenia, a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairments.
- BIPOLAR DISORDER (BD): There is some evidence to suggest that the DRD3 gene may be associated with bipolar disorder, a mental disorder characterized by manic and depressive episodes.
- PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET (PD): Some studies have implicated the DRD3 gene in the development of late-onset Parkinson disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, and impaired movement.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: There is no specific treatment for DRD3-related disorders. However, different medications available in the market work by targeting dopamine receptors.
- Prognosis: The prognosis for patients with DRD3-associated disorders varies depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- There is some evidence to suggest that DRD3 genetic variants may influence an individual's response to certain medications targeting dopamine receptors. For example, an association has been found between the rs6280 variant and the response to antipsychotic medication in patients with schizophrenia.
