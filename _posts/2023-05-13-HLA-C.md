# Information about gene HLA-C

## Genetic Position
The gene **HLA-C** is located on chromosome 6p21.33. It spans a genomic region of about 275 kilobases and consists of 8 exons.

## Pathology and Function
The HLA-C gene encodes for a major histocompatibility complex Class I (MHC-I) molecule expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells. The HLA-C protein plays a crucial role in immune system recognition of self and foreign antigens, presenting antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes for destruction. Abnormalities in HLA-C expression or function have been associated with various autoimmune and infectious diseases, including psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis C.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 4937
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 3107
- Ensembl: ENSG00000206503
- OMIM: 142840
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P10321

Aliases for HLA-C include MHC class I antigen C and major histocompatibility complex, class I, C.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA-C gene, resulting in various amino acid changes. Some of these SNPs and their associated amino acid changes include:

|Mutation Type|Amino Acid Change|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|Missense|Pro→Leu|rs9264942|
|Missense|Thr→Ala|rs2303283|
|Missense|Ser→Asn|rs1264457|
|Missense|Asp→His|rs9296009|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
A study published by Cortes and colleagues in Nature Genetics in 2013 reported somatic SNVs found in HLA-C in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. The following somatic SNVs were detected:

|Mutation Type|Amino Acid Change|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|Missense|Gly→Asp|rs200233544|
|Missense|Pro→Ser|rs116690715|
|Missense|Val→Ile|rs199707117|
|Missense|Thr→Ala|rs555985645|

## Related Disease
Abnormalities in the HLA-C gene have been associated with various autoimmune and infectious diseases, including psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis C.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment targeting HLA-C gene abnormalities. Prognosis and treatment vary depending on the associated disease.

## Drug Response
Studies have suggested that genetic variations in the HLA-C gene can affect the response to certain drugs, such as abacavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. The presence of the HLA-C*05:01 allele has been associated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir.
