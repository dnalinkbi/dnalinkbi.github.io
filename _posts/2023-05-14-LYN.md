# Gene Information: LYN

## Gene Position
LYN is located on chromosome 8 at the position 8q12.1.

## Pathology
Mutation in the LYN gene is associated with many diseases such as autoimmune disease, leukemia, and cancer.

## Gene Function
LYN encodes a protein tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in transmitting signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeted therapy is the typical treatment for LYN-related cancers. The prognosis varies depending on the type and stage of the cancer.

## Drug Response
Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown efficacy in the treatment of cancers with LYN mutations.
