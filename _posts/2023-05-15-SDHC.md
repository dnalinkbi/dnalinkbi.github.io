# Information on Gene SDHC

## Gene Position and Alias
- **Gene:** SDHC
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1 (1q23.3)
- **Aliases:** CYBL, PGL3, QPs3

External IDs:
- HGNC: 10606
- NCBI Entrez: 6392
- Ensembl: ENSG00000143384

## Function of Gene SDHC 
The SDHC gene encodes for part of an enzyme complex called the succinate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolic process of the cell. It catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the Krebs cycle and it plays a key role in the electron transfer chain. 

## Mutations 
The following are AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID for SDHC gene:
- D38N - Missense - rs1800624
- R31C - Missense - rs1800625

## Related Disease
Mutations on the SDHC gene have been linked to hereditary paragangliomas. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for hereditary paragangliomas include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy when necessary. The prognosis for people with paragangliomas depends on factors such as the size and location of the tumor, the severity of the symptoms, and the patient's overall health.

## Drug Response 
The SDHC gene is not currently known to have any drug responses.
