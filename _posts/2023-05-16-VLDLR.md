## Information about Gene VLDLR

### Genetic Position
- Gene: VLDLR (Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor)
- Chromosome: 9
- Location: p24.2
- Strand: -
- Molecularly defined regions: NG_009154.1
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): 7,600,462 - 7,648,835

### Pathology and Function
- Pathology: VLDLR mutations are associated with the autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia known as VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia (VLDLRCH).
- Function: VLDLR is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and neuronal migration in the brain.
