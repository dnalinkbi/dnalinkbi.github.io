## Gene: ADAM10
### Genetic Position: 
ADAM10 gene is located on chromosome 15 at the position 15q21.3.

### Pathology:
ADAM10 mutations have been associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and asthma.

### Function:
ADAM10 gene encodes a protein called "A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain 10" (ADAM10). This protein has been shown to play a critical role in multiple processes including cell adhesion, cell signaling, and proteolysis. It is also involved in the cleavage of cell-surface proteins, such as the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP).

### Related disease:
ADAM10 mutations have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, Breast cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer, and Asthma.

### Treatment and prognosis:
There is no cure for ADAM10 related diseases, but some drugs can help to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and asthma.

### Drug response:
Some drugs that target ADAM10 can be used to treat Alzheimer's disease and Cancer. For example, Î±-secretase activators have been shown to enhance ADAM10 activity, which results in reduced amyloid plaque and tumor growth.
