# Gene: DNMT1

DNMT1 is a gene that encodes the DNA methyltransferase 1 protein. This protein is responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication and repair, thus playing an essential role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Dysregulation of DNMT1 has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders.

## Function 

DNMT1 adds a methyl group to the cytosine nucleotide in the context of CpG dinucleotides, which leads to gene silencing. This process is critical for normal development, differentiation and cellular homeostasis.

|Mutation Type|AA Change|dbSNP ID|
|-------------|---------|--------|
|Missense|G→A (p.Arg770His)|rs587776854|
|Missense|G→C (p.Arg882Pro)|rs863224127|
|Frameshift|c.3109dupT (p.Thr1037Ilefs*4)|rs764016565|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in DNMT1 have been reported in various cancer types. Some of the reported somatic mutations in DNMT1 with their dbSNP ID are as follows:

|Mutation Type|AA Change|Cancer Type|dbSNP ID|
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
|Missense|G→A (p.Arg831Gln)|Gastric Cancer|rs786200975|
|Missense|C→T (p.Arg882Cys)|Lung Cancer|rs768236616|
|InDel|c.2057_2060del (p.Thr686Metfs*41)|Colorectal Cancer|rs755889980|

## Related Disease

Mutations or alterations in DNMT1 have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, immunodeficiency, and Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no targeted therapy available specifically for DNMT1-related diseases. However, DNMT inhibitors such as 5-azacytidine and decitabine have been used in cancer treatment due to their ability to inhibit DNMT1.

## Drug Response

Variations in DNMT1 have been reported to affect drug response. For instance, DNMT1 mutations were found to be associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands, leading to resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy drugs in ovarian cancer patients.
