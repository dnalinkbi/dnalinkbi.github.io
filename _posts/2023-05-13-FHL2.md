# Information about Gene FHL2

**Genetic Position**: FHL2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 at position 14.2 (2p14.2).

**Function**: FHL2 is a member of the four and a half LIM protein family, which plays a crucial role in cell differentiation, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. Moreover, FHL2 regulates the activities of various signaling pathways, including TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB.

**External IDs and Aliases**:

- HGNC: 3771
- NCBI Entrez: 2275
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115977
- OMIM: 602423
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q53T94

*Aliases:* FHL-2, DRAL, SLIM3, SLIM-3, SLMO2, SLIMMER

**AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Currently, there are more than 100 reported mutations in the FHL2 gene. Some of them are:

- rs141909625: c.515C>T (p.Arg172*), nonsense mutation
- rs137854073: c.267G>A (p.Arg89Gln), missense mutation
- rs757881502: c.382T>C (p.Leu128Ser), missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: The FHL2 gene is frequently mutated in various types of cancers, including liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Some of the somatic mutations reported in these cancers are:

- rs587782154: c.146A>G (p.Lys49Glu), missense mutation
- rs878853553: c.1009C>T (p.Arg337*), nonsense mutation

**Related Disease**: Mutations in the FHL2 gene have been associated with a range of diseases, including cancer, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and skeletal and cardiac muscle development defects.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no specific treatment available for FHL2 gene mutations. However, early diagnosis and proper management can improve the prognosis of the associated diseases.

**Drug Response**: The FHL2 gene has been identified as a potential target for cancer therapy. Some studies have reported that FHL2 inhibition can sensitize cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents.
