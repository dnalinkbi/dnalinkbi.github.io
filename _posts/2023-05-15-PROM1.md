# Information about gene PROM1

## Genetic position 
The PROM1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 4 at position 12.2.

## Pathology
The PROM1 gene has been associated with various pathologies, including retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and several types of cancer.

## Function 
PROM1 (Prominin-1), also known as CD133, is a glycoprotein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of various tissues. It is particularly important for the functioning of stem cells, where it serves as a marker for their identification and isolation.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for PROM1-related diseases. Treatment options are often limited to supportive therapy, such as vision aids or chemotherapy. The prognosis for PROM1-related diseases varies depending on the specific condition and disease stage.

## Drug response
Studies have identified various drugs that could potentially target PROM1, including anti-cancer drugs such as lapatinib and cisplatin.
