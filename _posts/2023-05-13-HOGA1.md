## Information about gene HOGA1

### Genetic position, pathology, and function
- **Genetic position:** HOGA1 gene is located on chromosome 10 at the position 10q24.31.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the HOGA1 gene have been associated with primary hyperoxaluria type III (PH3), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive production of oxalate leading to calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys and other organs.
- **Function:** The HOGA1 gene encodes for the enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase which plays a critical role in the catabolism of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of hydroxyproline to pyruvate and glyoxylate, which is then further metabolized to carbon dioxide and water in the liver and kidneys.

### Additional information

    - p.Ala193Val - Missense variant - rs149799413
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.
- **Related disease:** Primary Hyperoxaluria Type III.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** PH3 is a chronic disease without a curative treatment. Management strategies include dietary oxalate restriction, high fluid intake, and medications. In severe cases, liver or combined liver-kidney transplantation may be considered. Untreated PH3 can lead to end-stage renal disease and systemic oxalosis.
- **Drug response:** No specific drug response data is presently available.
