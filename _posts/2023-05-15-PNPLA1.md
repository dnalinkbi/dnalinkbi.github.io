# Information on Gene PNPLA1

## Genetic Position and Function
- Gene: PNPLA1
- Chromosome: 1
- Genomic Location: chr1:43,808,082-43,852,227
- Function: PNPLA1 encodes for a patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein that is primarily expressed in hair follicles. It is involved in the metabolism of glycerolipids and is essential for the proper formation of the epidermal barrier in the skin.

None reported.

## Related Disease
- Autosomal Recessive Woolly Hair/Hypotrichosis
  - PNPLA1 mutations have been found to cause this hair disorder characterized by sparse hair with tightly curled or twisted hair shafts. Mutations in PNPLA1 have also been linked to other hair disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment:
  - Currently, there is no cure for hair disorders caused by PNPLA1 mutations. However, symptomatic treatment can be given for associated scalp problems such as dryness and itching.
- Prognosis:
  - Individuals with PNPLA1 mutations can live a normal life but have a cosmetically concerning hair phenotype.

## Drug Response
- There is no information available on drug response for PNPLA1 mutations.
