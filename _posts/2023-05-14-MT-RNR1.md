## Gene MT-RNR1

- **Genetic Position:** MT-RNR1 is a gene that is located on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in humans.

- **Function for Gene:** This gene encodes for a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) which is essential for protein synthesis in the mitochondria.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC ID: 7475
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 4558
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000198712
    - OMIM ID: 561000
    - Genomic Location: MT:572-16023 

- **Aliases:** MTRNR1, RNR1, 12S rRNA, MT-RNR, and RPNS1

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID:** There are several mutations identified in the MT-RNR1 gene. Some of the important ones are:
    - m.1555A>G (rs267606617), associated with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss
    - m.827A>G (rs200165736), associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy
    - m.961delT, associated with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There is limited information available on the somatic mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including hearing loss, optic neuropathy, and diabetes.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options for MT-RNR1-associated diseases are limited to managing the symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the affected individual's age and health.

- **Drug Response:** The effectiveness of treatment with aminoglycosides can be influenced by mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene.
