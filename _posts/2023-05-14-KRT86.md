# Gene KRT86

## Gene Information
- **Function:** The KRT86 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 86, which is a member of a group of tough, fibrous proteins called keratins. Keratins form the structural framework of certain cells, including cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails.

- **External IDs:**
    - Gene ID: 3137
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 12q13.13
    - Aliases: KRT5B, hHb1, K86, KRTHB1, KRTA1

## Related Diseases
- Monilethrix
- Netherton syndrome-like disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for monilethrix and Netherton syndrome-like disorder. Treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms, such as hair loss.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and individual response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- No drugs specifically targeting KRT86 mutations have been developed yet.
- However, some drugs, such as minoxidil and finasteride, can be used to treat hair loss caused by certain conditions.
