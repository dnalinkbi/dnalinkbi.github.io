# Information about Gene ALOX5AP

## Genetic Position
ALOX5AP (*arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein*) gene is located on chromosome 13q12.12.

## Pathology and Function
ALOX5AP plays an important role in the synthesis of leukotrienes. It has been found to be associated with various diseases including atherosclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. ALOX5AP is also known to affect platelet function, vascular function, and inflammation.
