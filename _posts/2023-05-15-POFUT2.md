## Gene Information for POFUT2

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 20: 38,603,027 - 38,610,794

**Pathology:** Mutations in POFUT2 gene have been associated with Dowling-Degos disease, a skin disorder that causes dark, pigmented spots on the skin and can be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder.

**Function of Gene:** POFUT2 gene encodes for the enzyme protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins by the addition of O-fucose monosaccharides to serine or threonine residues. This modification is important in the Notch signaling pathway which is essential for cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.

- c.802-4T>A, rs148199369
- c.860G>A (p.Ser287Asn), rs200608240

**Related Disease:** Dowling-Degos disease

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for Dowling-Degos disease. Treatment mainly involves managing the symptoms and reducing the appearance of pigmented spots on the skin. Prognosis of the disease is usually good, as it is not life-threatening.

**Drug Response:** There is no specific drug therapy available for treating Dowling-Degos disease.
