## Gene KCNE1
- **Function:** The KCNE1 gene encodes a protein that is a regulatory subunit of potassium ion channel. It associates with KCNQ1 to form the slow delayed rectifier potassium ion channel, which plays a role in the repolarization of cardiac action potentials and in cardiac arrhythmogenesis.
- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
  - HGNC: 6254
  - NCBI Entrez: 3753
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000134954
  - OMIM: 176261
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P15382
  - Genomic Location: Chromosome 21:33,506,008-33,513,592
- **Aliases:** JLNS1, DFNA8, LQT2
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A30T | Missense | rs199472876 |
| G60D | Missense | rs121912636 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.
- **Related Disease:** KCNE1 gene mutations have been associated with Long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment of KCNE1-associated diseases typically involves beta-blockers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and lifestyle changes. The prognosis for Long QT syndrome depends on the severity of the condition, with some individuals experiencing sudden cardiac death. 
- **Drug Response:** Beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in managing Long QT syndrome in patients with KCNE1 mutations.
