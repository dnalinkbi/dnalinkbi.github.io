# Information about gene NR5A1 

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- Gene: NR5A1
- Genomic location: Chromosome 9q33.3 [1]
- Pathology: Mutations in NR5A1 gene have been associated with several developmental disorders, including disorders of sex development (DSD), premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), and adrenal insufficiency [2].
- Function: NR5A1 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 5 Group A Member 1), also known as SF1, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of genes important for the development and function of the adrenal gland, gonads, and ventromedial hypothalamus [3].
