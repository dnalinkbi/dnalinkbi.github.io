# Gene Information for RNF168

## Genetic Position
- **Gene Name:** RNF168 (Ring Finger Protein 168)
- **Chromosome:** 3
- **Start Position:** 104954411 bp
- **End Position:** 105082698 bp
- **Strand:** Plus (+)

## Pathology
- RNF168 has been implicated in various biological pathways, including DNA damage response, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling. Mutations in RNF168 have been associated with predisposition to breast cancer, which highlights the importance of its role in maintaining genomic stability.

## Function
- RNF168 encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of DNA damage response. It plays an important role in the recruitment of repair factors to DNA damage sites by ubiquitinating histones, which stimulates the recruitment of downstream repair factors and promotes the resolution of DNA damage. 

## External IDs and Aliases
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:22221
- **Entrez Gene ID:** 56850
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000114270
