# Gene: CHRNA5

## Basic Information
- Chromosome: 15
- Genomic Position: 78,804,981 - 78,839,123
- Alias: nAChRα5, CHRNA5, NACHRA5, AChRα5, Acra5, FDA25

## Function 
- The CHRNA5 gene provides the instructions for making a protein called nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-5(nAChRα5). This protein is a subunit of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is located in the cell membrane and plays a key role in chemical communication between nerve cells.

## Related Disease
- Lung Cancer, Nicotine Dependence, Schizophrenia, Panic Disorder, Alzheimer Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parkinson Disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Nicotine replacement therapy in smokers with high-risk CHRNA5-A3-B4 genotypes can improve smoking cessation outcomes.

## Drug Response
- Variations in the CHRNA5 gene have been associated with varying levels of smoking behavior, response to nicotine replacement therapy, and response to cessation drugs such as varenicline and bupropion.
