# Gene: NODAL

## Information:

- **Function:** NODAL is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily that plays an important role in embryonic development, specifically in the formation of anterior/posterior axis and left/right symmetry. It is involved in the development of heart, pancreas, and the nervous system.

- **External IDs:** 
    - **Gene ID:** 4846 
    - **Genomic Location:** Chr10:124034243-124041791
    - **Aliases:** NDAL, TGFb-related activin receptor, Taram-A, TDGF1

- **AA Mutation List:**
    - p.Gly56Val (rs61749377)
    - p.Pro412Ser (rs72666186)
    - p.Asp309Gly (rs115794052)

- **Mutation Type:** Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** There are several somatic SNVs in NODAL, including:
    - c. 1253G>A (p.Cys418Tyr) (rs149628311)
    - c.1081A>G (p.Asn361Ser) (rs531564862)
    - c.256G>A (p.Arg86His) (rs536766996)

- **Related Diseases:** NODAL has been linked to several diseases, including:
    - Heterotaxy syndrome
    - Tetralogy of Fallot
    - Atrial Fibrillation

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no known treatment for NODAL mutations. Prognosis depends on the specific disease associated with the mutation.

- **Drug Response:** There is no known drug that specifically targets NODAL.
