# Gene: ICK

- **Function:** ICK (intestinal cell kinase) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation, and differentiation. 

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**

  - **Aliases:** MAK, MAPKAPK5 
  - **HGNC ID:** 6844
  - **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 55606
  - **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000134247
  - **Genomic location:** Chromosome 2q33.3


- **Mutation and Variant:**

  - **AA mutation list along with mutation type and dbSNP ID:**
    - c.869T>C (p.Cys290Arg) - missense mutation - rs374540744
    - c.634C>T (p.Pro212Leu) - missense mutation - rs3212396
    - c.1321C>A (p.Asn441Lys) - missense mutation - rs370735095

  - **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.632C>A - rs200731422
    - c.764A>C - rs111313168
    - c.1468C>A - rs201915398


- **Related Disease:** ICK mutations have been associated with a few rare genetic disorders such as nemaline myopathy, osteopenia, impaired fracture healing, and lymphopenia. 

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with ICK mutations depend on the specific symptoms and severity of the disorder. 

- **Drug Response:** No drug has been specifically designed to target ICK kinase yet.
