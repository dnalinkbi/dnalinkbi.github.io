# Genetic Information of Gene WWTR1

## Gene Overview
- Gene name: WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 (WWTR1)
- Function: WWTR1 encodes a transcriptional co-activator that acts downstream of the Hippo pathway in promoting gene expression of various target genes, including those involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. 
- Genomic location: Chromosome 3q25.1
- Aliases: TAZ (Transcriptional Co-Activator With PDZ Binding Motif)

## Related Disease
- WWTR1 has been implicated in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and mesothelioma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Research is ongoing to identify potential therapeutic targets involving WWTR1 for cancer treatment. Currently, there are no established treatments that target WWTR1.
- The prognosis for individuals with WWTR1-associated cancers can vary depending on the specific type and stage of the cancer.

## Drug Response
- Research is needed to determine if targeting WWTR1 could lead to improved drug responses for individuals with cancer.
