# Gene: NT5E

## Information

- **Pathology:** NT5E gene, also known as CD73, is involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and tissue regeneration. Aberrant expression of CD73 has been associated with several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders. 

- **Function:** CD73 is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP to adenosine. Adenosine has potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and promotes tissue repair and regeneration.

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 8042
    - NCBI Entrez: 4907
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000139567
    - OMIM: 129190
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P21589
    - Aliases: 5'-nucleotidase, NT5, CD73, E5NT, NT5ALPHA

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs17881723: p.Asn192Asp (missense mutation)
    - rs56016088: p.Asp23Asn (missense mutation)
    - rs34324107: p.Gln205Arg (missense mutation)
    - rs35658476: p.Thr200Ala (missense mutation)
    - rs587776820: p.Arg132Gln (missense mutation)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs869019065: c.803A>G (p.Thr268Ala) (in melanoma)
    - rs367732974: c.620G>C (p.Asp207His) (in melanoma)
    - rs1422316146: c.822C>A (p.Asp274Glu) (in melanoma)

- **Related Disease:** 
    - Cancer (colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma)
    - Cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, hypertension)
    - Autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis)

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** 
    - CD73 inhibitors are currently under clinical development as potential cancer therapies. 
    - The presence of CD73 in tumors has been associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients.

- **Drug Response:**
    - Anti-CD73 antibodies are being evaluated as cancer immunotherapies.
