## Information about Gene GUCY2D

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17: 74,505,151 - 74,552,840 

**Pathology:** Mutations in the GUCY2D gene are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), which is an inherited retinal dystrophy that leads to blindness in infancy or early childhood.

**Function:** The GUCY2D gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called retinal guanylyl cyclase-1 (GC1), which is found in rod and cone cells in the retina. GC1 is involved in the visual transduction cascade, which is the process in which light is converted into neural signals that are sent to the brain. GC1 catalyzes the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), which is a key molecule in the process of visual transduction.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no reported somatic mutations for the GUCY2D gene.

**Related Disease:** Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for LCA. Treatment options are limited and generally focus on management of symptoms. Gene therapy is a promising approach for treating LCA caused by mutations in the GUCY2D gene.

**Drug Response:** There is no known drug therapy specifically targeted to mutations in the GUCY2D gene.
