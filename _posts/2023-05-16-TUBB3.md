# Information about Gene TUBB3

## Genetic Position
The TUBB3 gene is located on chromosome 16 at the position 16q24.3.

## Pathology and Function
The TUBB3 gene codes for the protein Beta-tubulin 3, which is a member of the microtubule family. Beta-tubulin 3 is involved in the formation of microtubules which are necessary for cell division, intracellular transport, and organization of cytoskeleton. Mutations in the TUBB3 gene have been associated with various neurological disorders including congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Cortical dysplasia with focal epilepsy.
