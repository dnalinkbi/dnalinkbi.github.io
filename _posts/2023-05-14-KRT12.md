# Gene KRT12

**Function:** The KRT12 gene encodes a protein known as keratin 12. The protein is involved in the formation of the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye. Keratin 12 provides structural support for cells in this tissue.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 6445
- NCBI Entrez: 3858
- Ensembl: ENSG00000146457
- OMIM: 148190
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q99456

**Aliases:** 
- CK12
- K12
- MECD2

**AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID:**
- R62W, missense, rs121908156

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.375C>T, missense, rs587776825
- c.290delA, frameshift, rs587776824
- c.152C>T, missense, rs587776827

**Related disease:** Mutations in KRT12 can cause various corneal diseases, including cornea plana, Meesmann corneal dystrophy, and various forms of epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy (ERED).

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for corneal diseases caused by KRT12 mutations varies depending on the specific disease and its severity. In some cases, lubricating eye drops or ointments can help manage symptoms. In more severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. Prognosis also varies depending on the specific disease and its severity.

**Drug response:** There is currently no specific drug known to target KRT12 mutations or related corneal diseases.
