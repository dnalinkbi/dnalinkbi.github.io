# Information about Gene IYD

## Genetic Position
- **Chromosome**: 6
- **Genomic Position**: 34,107,792 - 34,123,463
- **Strand**: Plus

## Pathology
- **Disease**: Hypothyroidism
- **Pathway**: Thyroid hormone metabolism

## Function
The IYD gene encodes a dioxygenase enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of thyroid hormones. It catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, which is necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones.

- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000112195
- **OMIM**: 617350
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: Q6PJP8
- **Aliases**: DEHAL1, HPDI2

## Related Disease
- Congenital hypothyroidism
- Thyroid dyshormonogenesis

## Treatment and Prognosis
Congenital hypothyroidism caused by IYD gene mutations can be treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Early detection and treatment usually result in normal growth and development. However, if left untreated, the condition can lead to intellectual disability and other health problems.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response specific to IYD gene mutations.
