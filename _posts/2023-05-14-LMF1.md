## Gene: LMF1

### Function:
The LMF1 gene is believed to play a crucial role in lipid metabolism and its dysfunction has been linked to dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders. The protein encoded by LMF1 is involved in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC ID: HGNC:16513
- Entrez ID: 29975
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000130704
- OMIM ID: 611760
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6ZWL3
- Aliases: Lipase Maturation Factor 1, B7S811, UNQ772/PRO1554

### AA mutation list and mutation types with dbSNP ID:
- There are several mutations identified in the LMF1 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations.
- Some of the reported mutations in LMF1 gene with dbSNP ID are:
    - c.346C>T (p.Arg116*)
    - c.1A>G (p.Met1?)
    - c.932G>C (p.Arg311Pro)
    - c.925G>A (p.Gly309Ser)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the LMF1 gene. Some of them with dbSNP ID are:
- rs148660136
- rs193302173 
- rs142143946

### Related Disease:
LMF1 gene mutations have been associated with lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD), hypertriglyceridemia, and other metabolic disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for LMF1 gene-related disorders. Treatment mainly aims to manage the symptoms and underlying conditions. Early diagnosis and intervention can improve the prognosis in some cases.

### Drug response:
There is no known drug response specifically for LMF1 gene-related disorders.
