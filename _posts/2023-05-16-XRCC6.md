## Gene XRCC6

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 22
- Location: 22q13.2

### Pathology 
Mutations in XRCC6 gene have been implicated in various types of cancer including breast, prostate, lung, liver, and colon cancer. 

### Function 
The XRCC6 gene encodes for the protein Ku70 which is involved in DNA damage repair and maintenance of genomic stability.

- Lung cancer
- Liver cancer
- Colon cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for cancers associated with mutations in XRCC6 gene include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with these cancers is generally poor, with a high risk of recurrence and metastasis.

### Drug Response
Studies have suggested that mutations in the XRCC6 gene may affect the response to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin and etoposide.
