## Gene XPA

### Function
The XPA gene is involved in the process of DNA repair. It plays a crucial role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing certain types of DNA damage, including UV-induced damage.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- Gene ID: 7507
- Genomic location: Chromosome 9: 37,432,947-37,460,561
- Aliases: XPAC, XPACD, ERCC1, RAD16

### Related Disease
Mutations in XPA have been associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XP-A), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight and an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for XP-A, and treatment mainly consists of avoiding exposure to sunlight and regular skin cancer screening. The prognosis for individuals with XP-A is variable and depends on the severity of their symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug treatment for XP-A. Some studies have suggested that certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, may be less effective in individuals with NER defects.
