## Gene Information for IL4R

### Function for gene
The IL4R gene encodes for the interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain which is a receptor for interleukin 4 (IL-4). IL-4R plays a role in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
Gene name: IL4R
Aliases: CD124, IL4RA
Genomic location: Chromosome 16q12.1

Several somatic Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) and Insertions/Deletions (InDels) have been reported for IL4R gene in various cancers with dbSNP ID. Some of them are:
- rs796345138
- rs60544808
- rs587782600

### Related Disease
Abnormal expression or mutations in the IL4R gene have been linked to various diseases such as allergic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.

### Treatment and prognosis
Targeting the IL4R gene/protein with monoclonal antibodies or other therapies is being explored as a treatment option for allergic asthma and cancer. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in the IL4R gene may vary depending on the severity and associated medical conditions.

### Drug response
Some drugs targeting IL-4 and IL-4R are under investigation for the treatment of allergic diseases and cancers.
