## Gene Information

**Gene Symbol:** PRNP

**Gene Name:** Prion Protein

**Genomic Position:** Chromosome 20: 46,316,256 - 46,325,684 

**Aliases:** CJD, PRIP, GSS, CD230, PRP27-30

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: HGNC:PRNP
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 5621
- Ensembl: ENSG00000253253
- OMIM: 176640
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04156

## Function

The PRNP gene encodes for the prion protein that is mainly expressed in the brain and helps to maintain neural homeostasis. It is also involved in signal transduction, neuronal differentiation, and cell adhesion.

## Mutations and Variations

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

No known somatic variations for the PRNP gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the PRNP gene have been associated with several prion diseases, including:
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease 
- Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome 
- Fatal Familial Insomnia

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known cure for prion diseases caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, and treatment is primarily supportive care.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug that can directly treat prion diseases caused by mutations in the PRNP gene.
