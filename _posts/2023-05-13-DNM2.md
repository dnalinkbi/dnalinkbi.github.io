# Information on Gene DNM2

**Function:** The DNM2 gene encodes a protein called Dynamin-2, which regulates endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal reorganization.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 2943
- NCBI Entrez: 1785
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137445
- OMIM: 602378
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P50570

**Aliases:** Centaurin, Diaphanous-interacting protein, DYNAMIN2, DYN2

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- c.1522G>A (p.Glu508Lys) - rs104894116 
- c.1878G>A (p.Arg626Gln) - rs104894117
- c.1960C>T (p.Arg654Trp) - rs104894118
- c.2044C>T (p.Pro682Leu) - rs104894119
- c.2084T>C (p.Trp695Arg) - rs104894120

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the DNM2 gene have been linked to several disorders including:
- Centronuclear myopathy 
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2M
- Spinal muscular atrophy, distal, X-linked 2

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for diseases caused by DNM2 mutations, and treatment is supportive. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of symptoms.

**Drug Response:** No information available.
