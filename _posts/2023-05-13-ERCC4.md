## Gene Function
ERCC4 encodes for a protein involved in DNA repair mechanisms such as nucleotide excision repair and DNA interstrand cross-link repair.

## Mutations
### AA Mutation List:
- p.Arg84Gln (R84Q)
- p.Arg415Trp (R415W)
- p.Lys546Thr (K546T)

### Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:
- Missense: rs113994072, rs148937760
- Nonsense: rs1048940261

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

## Related Disease:
- Xeroderma pigmentosum
- Fanconi anemia

## Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment and prognosis are highly dependent on the specific mutation and associated disease. Some approaches may include photoprotection, skin cancer screening, and stem cell transplantation in severe cases of Fanconi anemia.

## Drug Response:
ERCC4 mutations could confer altered drug response and increased susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin.
