# Gene: TCL1A

## Information

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 14q32.13

**Pathology:** TCL1A gene has been found to be associated with a variety of cancers, including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

**Function:** The TCL1A gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. It also plays a role in the development of B-cells.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 11551
- NCBI Entrez: 8115
- Ensembl: ENSG00000119699
- OMIM: 186995
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P56279

**Aliases:** TCL1, TCL-1, TCL1L

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Lys44Arg (missense variant) with dbSNP ID: rs72542413
- p.Ser67Gly (missense variant) with dbSNP ID: rs727504160

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.264delA (frameshift deletion) with dbSNP ID: rs786203542
- c.259G>T (missense variant) with dbSNP ID: rs771125108

**Related Disease:** TCL1A mutations have been found in various cancers, including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis vary according to the type and stage of cancer.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no specific drug that targets TCL1A. However, some drugs have been shown to affect the activity of TCL1A.
