## Gene MPHOSPH8

- Function: MPHOSPH8 (M-phase phosphoprotein 8) plays a role in microtubule organization and spindle assembly during mitosis. It is also involved in cytokinesis, which is the process of cell division after mitosis.

- Related disease: There are currently no diseases directly associated with MPHOSPH8 mutations. However, recent studies have suggested that MPHOSPH8 may play a role in the development and progression of certain cancers, including lung cancer and breast cancer.

- Treatment and prognosis: There are currently no targeted therapies available for MPHOSPH8 mutations. Treatment options would depend on the specific disease or cancer associated with the mutation. Prognosis would also depend on the stage and severity of the disease.

- Drug response: There is currently no information available on whether MPHOSPH8 mutations affect drug response.
