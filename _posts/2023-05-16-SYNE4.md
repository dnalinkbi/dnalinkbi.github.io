# Gene SYNE4

## Genetic Position
The SYNE4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 19p13.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in SYNE4 have been associated with various pathologies, including muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and some forms of cancer.

## Function
The SYNE4 gene codes for nesprin-4 protein, which is required for proper nuclear positioning and migration in muscle cells.
