## Gene Information

Gene Name: CAPN3

### Function for gene
CAPN3 encodes calpain-3, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that is located within the sarcomere of skeletal muscle. It plays a role in muscle development, maintenance, and tissue remodeling through proteolysis of various substrates.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There have been several reported somatic mutations in CAPN3 in various cancers, but there are currently no SNPs found in CAPN3. 

### Related disease

CAPN3 mutations have been associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), a progressive muscle-wasting disease that affects primarily the pelvic and shoulder girdles. 

### Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for LGMD2A, but treatment options aim to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Physical therapy, braces and assistive devices, respiratory support, and medications to manage pain, inflammation, and other symptoms may be recommended. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and age of onset, but most individuals with LGMD2A have a shortened lifespan and progressive loss of mobility.

### Drug response

There are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for LGMD2A, but several drugs have been investigated for their potential to improve muscle function and slow disease progression, including corticosteroids, creatine, and gene therapy.
