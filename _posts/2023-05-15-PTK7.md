## Gene: PTK7

- **Function:** PTK7 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is also involved in several signaling pathways, including the Wnt, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways.

- **Related Disease:** PTK7 has been associated with several cancer types, including breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. It has also been linked to developmental disorders, such as neural tube defects.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** As PTK7 is involved in several signaling pathways related to cancer progression and metastasis, it has been considered as a potential target for cancer therapy. However, more research is needed to determine its exact role in different cancer types and its therapeutic potential.

- **Drug Response:** There are currently no drugs specifically targeting PTK7, but several compounds have been identified as potential inhibitors of its activity.
