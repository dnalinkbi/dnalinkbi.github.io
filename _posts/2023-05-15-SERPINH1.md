# Gene SERPINH1

## Information about gene
SERPINH1 gene encodes for a heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), which is a collagen-specific molecular chaperone. The HSP47 assists in proper folding and stability of procollagen molecules in endoplasmic reticulum.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: 8851
- NCBI Entrez ID: 871
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000144751
- OMIM ID: 600943
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P50454
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q13.5

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- No non-synonymous mutations are recorded in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations are recorded in the dbSNP database.

## Related disease
Mutations or polymorphisms in SERPINH1 are associated with various disorders, including osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and Cystic Fibrosis-related disorders. 

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment may vary depending on the underlying disorder. For OI, supportive care and bisphosphonate treatment has shown some benefit in reducing fractures. For CF-related disorders, management includes treating the respiratory symptoms and infections, and nutritional support. 

## Drug response
No drug response information is available for SERPINH1.
