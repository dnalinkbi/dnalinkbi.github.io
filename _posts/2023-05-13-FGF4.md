# Gene FGF4

## Genetic Position
The FGF4 gene is located on chromosome 11q13.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FGF4 gene can lead to various diseases including certain cancers, skeletal disorders, and craniosynostosis.

## Function
The FGF4 gene is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and migration during embryonic development and plays an important role in limb formation.
