## Information about gene ACACB

### Genetic Position
ACACB gene is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q23.3.

### Pathology
Variations in ACACB gene are associated with various disorders such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and obesity.

### Function
ACACB gene encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta which plays a key role in fatty acid synthesis and energy metabolism. It catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA which is the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of fatty acids.
