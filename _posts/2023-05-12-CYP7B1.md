# Gene: CYP7B1

## Genetic Position
CYP7B1 is located on chromosome 8q21.3 and consists of 10 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in CYP7B1 have been associated with a variety of diseases including metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Function
CYP7B1 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of cholesterol and sterol hormones, as well as in the regulation of bile acid synthesis. In addition, CYP7B1 is involved in the catabolism of neuroactive steroids and may play a role in myelin synthesis.
