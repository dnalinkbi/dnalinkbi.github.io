# Information about gene NPHP4

## Gene position, pathology, and function
NPHP4 is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.31. This gene encodes for a protein called nephrocystin-4, which is localized in the primary cilia and is involved in the development and maintenance of the renal tubules. Mutations in NPHP4 are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called nephronophthisis (NPH), which is characterized by cystic renal disease and usually leads to end-stage renal failure.

## Function for gene
The encoded protein is involved in protein-protein interactions, participating in the formation of protein complexes that regulate ciliary transport and signaling, as well as cell cycle progression and DNA repair.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic variants of NPHP4 have been reported in the dbSNP database.

## Related disease
Mutations in NPHP4 have been associated with nephronophthisis (NPH), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cystic renal disease that usually leads to end-stage renal failure.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for nephronophthisis, and treatment is mainly supportive. Patients with NPH may require support from dialysis or kidney transplant. The prognosis for NPH varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug response
There is no known drug that targets NPHP4 specifically. Treatment for NPH typically involves controlling hypertension and anemia and addressing other symptoms as they arise.
