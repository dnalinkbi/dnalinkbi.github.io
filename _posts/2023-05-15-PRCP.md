## Gene PRCP

### Genetic Position
The gene PRCP is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q13.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the PRCP gene have been associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

### Function
The PRCP gene encodes for the enzyme prolylcarboxypeptidase which cleaves the carboxy-terminal amino acid from peptides containing proline residues.
