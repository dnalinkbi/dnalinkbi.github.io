## Gene NRTN

### Genetic Position
- The NRTN gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.3).

### Pathology
- The NRTN gene is associated with the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Mutations in this gene have been linked to Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

### Function
- The NRTN gene encodes for a protein called Neurturin, which belongs to the family of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors (GDNF). Neurturin plays a critical role in the development of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and their survival during adulthood.

### Related Disease
- Parkinson's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Major depressive disorder

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Neurturin protein therapy is being developed as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease. Clinical trials have shown promising results in improving motor function in patients.
- However, the long-term prognosis of Parkinson's disease remains unclear.

### Drug Response
- Neurturin has been shown to enhance the efficacy of levodopa, a common medication for Parkinson's disease.
