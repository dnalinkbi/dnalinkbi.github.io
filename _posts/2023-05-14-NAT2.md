# Information about gene NAT2

## Genetic Position
The NAT2 gene is located on chromosome 8 in humans at position 8p22. It is composed of 8 exons and spans about 33 kilobases.

## Pathology
NAT2 gene encodes an enzyme called N-acetyltransferase 2, which is involved in the detoxification and metabolism of a variety of drugs, carcinogens, and other xenobiotic substances. Genetic variations in the NAT2 gene can affect the activity of the enzyme, leading to differences in drug response and susceptibility to certain diseases.

## Function for gene
The NAT2 gene plays an important role in the metabolism and elimination of drugs and toxins from the body. Specifically, it catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A to the amino group of arylamine and hydrazine substrates, resulting in their detoxification and elimination through urine and bile.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several variations or mutations in the amino acid sequence of NAT2, some of which have been associated with drug metabolism and toxicity. Some examples include:
- p.Arg64Gln (rs1801280)
- p.Arg197Gln (rs1799929)
- p.Ile114Thr (rs1799930)
- p.Met1Val (rs1495741)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations or SNVs/InDels have been reported in the NAT2 gene, including:
- c.109-17C>T (rs1801280)
- c.191-17T>C (rs1799930)
- c.282T>G (rs1799929)

## Related disease
Variations in the NAT2 gene have been associated with the risk and progression of several diseases, including:
- Bladder cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Parkinson's disease
- Tuberculosis
- And more

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for diseases related to NAT2 gene variations depend on the specific condition and the severity of the mutations. In some cases, drugs may need to be adjusted or avoided to prevent toxicity or side effects.

## Drug response
Variations in the NAT2 gene can affect drug response and toxicity by altering the activity and expression of the N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme. For example, slow acetylators may be at increased risk of toxicity from drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine, and procainamide.
