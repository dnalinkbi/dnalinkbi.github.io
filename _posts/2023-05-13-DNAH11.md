## Function of the Gene
The DNAH11 gene is involved in the production of dynein, a motor protein that plays an important role in cilia and flagella movement. Specifically, DNAH11 provides instructions to make a protein that forms a part of dynein called the "heavy chain." Dynein is responsible for moving organelles and other cargo using microtubules, and it aids in the movement of cilia and flagella to propel substances along cell surfaces.
