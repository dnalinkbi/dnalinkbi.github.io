# Gene Information for RNASEH2B

## Gene Position 

The RNASEH2B gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 13, specifically at 13q14.3.

## Pathology 

Mutations in the RNASEH2B gene have been associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), which is an autosomal recessive neuroinflammatory disorder with symptoms similar to those of congenital viral infection.

## Function

The RNASEH2B gene encodes for an endoribonuclease enzyme that is involved in RNA metabolism. It specifically cleaves RNA-RNA duplexes and RNA-DNA hybrids, and plays a role in the removal of ribonucleotides from chromosomal DNA.
