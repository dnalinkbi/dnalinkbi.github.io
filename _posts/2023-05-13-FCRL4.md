# Information on Gene FCRL4

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p36.13
- Strand: Negative

### Pathology
- FCRL4 variants have been found to be associated with susceptibility to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

### Function
- FCRL4 encodes a member of the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily and is involved in the regulation of B-cell activation and differentiation.
- The protein functions as a modulator of immunoglobulin secretion and may inhibit the function of certain immunomodulatory receptors such as CD40 and CD86.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:17067
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 83416
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000125952
- OMIM ID: 609702
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q96P31
- Aliases: FCRH4, IFGP4

### AA Mutation List
- No AA mutations have been reported for FCRL4.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
- Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for FCRL4 with dbSNP IDs rs1171059730, rs372815099, and rs759503171.

### Related Disease
- FCRL4 variants have been associated with the susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no targeted treatment for FCRL4-related diseases, but it is generally expected that treatments for the underlying autoimmune or inflammatory disease will also benefit patients with FCRL4 variants.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no reported drug response specifically related to FCRL4 variants.
