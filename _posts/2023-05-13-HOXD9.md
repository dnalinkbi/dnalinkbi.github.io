# Information on Gene HOXD9

## Gene Information
- **Function:** This gene provides instructions for producing a protein that plays a role in the regulation of the development and growth of limbs, spinal column, and other tissues during embryonic development.
- **External IDs:** HOXD9, homeobox D9; located on chromosome 2q31.1. 
- **Aliases:** HOX4, HOX4D, HOX-4.4
