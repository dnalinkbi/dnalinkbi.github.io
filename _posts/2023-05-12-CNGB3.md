## Gene CNGB3

CNGB3 is a gene located on chromosome 8 at the position 8q21.3. It encodes for a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta-3 subunit. 

### Function

The CNGB3 gene encodes for a subunit of the rod photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. The CNG channels are responsible for converting light signals into electrical signals in the retina. The beta-3 subunit plays a crucial role in the function and localization of the CNG channel in the photoreceptor outer segments.

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.

### Related Diseases

Mutations in CNGB3 are associated with several retinal diseases such as achromatopsia type 2, retinitis pigmentosa type 45, cone-rod dystrophy, and oligocone trichromacy. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no curative treatments for CNGB3-associated retinal diseases. Management usually involves supportive measures such as low vision aids and genetic counseling. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and age of onset.

### Drug Response

There is no known drug response for CNGB3-associated retinal diseases.
