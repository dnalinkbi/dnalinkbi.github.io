# Gene FAAH

### Function 

The FAAH gene encodes an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which is responsible for degradation of a class of signaling molecules called endocannabinoids. These molecules play a role in various physiological and pathological processes in the body, including pain sensation, appetite regulation, and inflammation.

- rs1800828
- rs184192444
- rs3727619
- rs145108347

### Related Disease

Previous studies have suggested that FAAH dysfunction may be involved in the regulation of pain, mood, addiction, and other neurological processes. Mutations or altered expression of FAAH have been associated with various types of diseases, including: 

- Depression
- Anxiety disorders
- Substance use disorders
- Neuropathic pain
- Inflammatory diseases
- Epilepsy

### Treatment and Prognosis

Current research is exploring the potential for FAAH inhibitors as therapeutic agents for certain conditions that involve endocannabinoid signaling dysfunction. However, more research is needed to understand the full therapeutic potential of targeting FAAH.

### Drug Response

Several FAAH inhibitors have been developed and tested in preclinical and clinical studies, including: 

- URB597
- PF-3845
- JNJ-42165279
- BIA 10-2474

However, clinical trials of some FAAH inhibitors have been halted due to unexpected toxicity.
