### Related Disease
The deregulation of the TXNIP gene has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Due to its involvement in various diseases, TXNIP regulation is being explored as a therapeutic target. Nevertheless, the development of drugs targeting TXNIP is still in its infancy and requires further investigation.

### Drug Response
Numerous compounds have been described to affect TXNIP expression/function, including small molecules, peptides, and natural compounds. Some of these compounds include butein, curcumin, kaempferol, resveratrol, and sulforaphane.
