# Gene: TMPRSS3

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 21
- Location: 21q22.3

## Pathology
- TMPRSS3 gene encodes for type II transmembrane serine protease 3 protein.
- Mutations in this gene are associated with nonsyndromic deafness.
- TMPRSS3 mutations have been shown to cause congenital hearing impairment by affecting the development or function of inner ear hair cells.

## Function
- TMPRSS3 gene plays an important role in the maintenance of inner ear hair cells.
- It is involved in the maturation and maintenance of stereocilia bundles in the inner ear.
- TMPRSS3 is involved in the proteolytic processing of proteins on the cell surface.
