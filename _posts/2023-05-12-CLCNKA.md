## Gene: CLCNKA

### Gene function
The CLCNKA gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms a chloride channel in the kidneys. The channel helps regulate the balance of salt and water in the body, which is important for maintaining blood pressure, pH balance, and overall health.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations for CLCNKA.

### Related disease
Mutations in the CLCNKA gene can cause Bartter syndrome type 4B, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects kidney function. The condition is characterized by low levels of potassium, chloride, and sodium in the blood, leading to symptoms such as dehydration, weakness, and fatigue.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for Bartter syndrome type 4B, but treatment can help manage the symptoms. Treatment options include medication to replace lost electrolytes and fluids, as well as high-calorie diets to maintain weight.

### Drug response
There is currently no known drug response for CLCNKA mutations.
