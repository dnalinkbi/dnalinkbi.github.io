## Gene MCM9 Information

### 1. Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

Gene MCM9 is located on chromosome 6 (6q21) in human genome and encodes for minichromosome maintenance complex component 9 protein. This protein plays a significant role in DNA replication and DNA damage repair processes. MCM9 protein also interacts with other proteins involved in meiotic recombination and homologous recombination repair.

Mutations in MCM9 gene have been associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by early depletion of ovarian follicles and resulting infertility. Additionally, MCM9 mutations have been implicated in the development of breast and ovarian cancers.

### 2. Function for Gene

The primary function of MCM9 gene is DNA replication and DNA damage repair processes. MCM9 protein also plays a role in meiotic recombination and homologous recombination repair.

### 4. AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in MCM9 gene database. Some of the significant amino acid (AA) changes with their mutation type and dbSNP ID are mentioned below:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Arg42Gln | Missense | rs113169107 |
| Pro266Leu | Missense | rs538147114 |
| Gly423Asp | Missense | rs587777434 |

| Trp1387Ter | Nonsense | rs137853222 |

### 5. Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in MCM9 gene database. However, dbSNP ID information is not available for these variations.

### 6. Related Disease

MCM9 gene mutations have been associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), which causes infertility due to the early depletion of ovarian follicles. Additionally, MCM9 mutations have been implicated in the development of breast and ovarian cancers.

### 7. Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific drug or therapy available for MCM9 gene mutations or related diseases. However, ovarian insufficiency can be managed with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), while cancer treatment options depend on the stage, type, and location of the cancer.

### 8. Drug Response

There is no available information about drug response for MCM9 gene mutations or related diseases.
