## Gene Information

**Gene Symbol**: TENM3

**Function for Gene**: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. It is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration during development, and its aberrant expression has been implicated in various cancers.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000137671
- OMIM: 604985
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95998


**Aliases**: 

- BRICHOS domain-containing protein 8
- ODZ3
- Ten-m3

**Genomic Location**: Chromosome 5 (5q14.3)
