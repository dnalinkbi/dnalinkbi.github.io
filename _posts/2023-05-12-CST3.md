# Information about Gene CST3

## Summary
The CST3 gene, also known as cystatin C, is located on chromosome 20 and encodes a protein that functions as a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteases. Mutations in CST3 have been associated with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis.

## Function
The CST3 gene encodes cystatin C, a protein that functions as an inhibitor of cysteine proteases. Specifically, cystatin C inhibits the activity of cathepsin B, H, and L, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as protein degradation, antigen processing, and apoptosis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for CST3 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CST3 have been associated with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA), which is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cerebral hemorrhage and progressive dementia.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for HCHWA, and treatment is primarily supportive care. The prognosis for individuals with HCHWA is generally poor, with a mean survival time of 8 years after the onset of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug therapy available for HCHWA.
