# Gene GLP1R

**Pathology and Function**

The GLP1R gene (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor) encodes a protein that is part of the incretin hormone pathway, which regulates insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Mutations in the GLP1R gene have been associated with several diseases related to insulin resistance and diabetes, including obesity and type 2 diabetes.

**Function for Gene**

The GLP1R gene's protein is a G protein-coupled receptor, which means it activates intracellular signaling pathways in response to ligand binding. In this case, GLP1R is activated by the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is produced in the gut and stimulates insulin secretion in response to food consumption. The GLP1R protein is expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it mediates the effects of GLP-1 and regulates glucose homeostasis.

- NCBI Entrez: 2740
- Ensembl: ENSG00000168484
- OMIM: 601881
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P43220 

The GLP1R gene is located on chromosome 6, specifically on 6p21.2-p21.1.

- GLP1-R
- GLR

**AA Mutation list and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid mutations that have been identified in the GLP1R gene. Some examples with their dbSNP ID and mutation type are:

- rs1030545 (missense)
- rs3765467 (missense)
- rs1042044 (missense)
- rs3890745 (synonymous)
- rs10501634 (intron variant)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

There are several somatic mutations in GLP1R gene that have been associated with several types of cancer, including thyroid, lung and colorectal cancers. Some examples with their dbSNP ID:

- rs121913486 (missense)
- rs200156153 (missense)
- rs576165131 (frameshift)
- rs200734062 (stop-gained)

**Related Disease**

Mutations in GLP1R gene are related to multiple diseases related to insulin resistance and diabetes, including:

- Type 2 diabetes
- Obesity
- Maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 5 (MODY5)

**Treatment and Prognosis**

There are several drugs targeting GLP-1 receptor being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some examples are liraglutide and exenatide. These drugs increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon levels, and promote satiety, leading to improved glycemic control.

**Drug Response**

Variations in the GLP1R gene can affect the response to certain drugs targeting GLP-1 receptor. For example, carriers of certain GLP1R gene mutations may be more or less responsive to GLP-1 agonist therapies.
