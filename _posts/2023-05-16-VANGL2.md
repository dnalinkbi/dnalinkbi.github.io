# Gene VANGL2 

## Genetic Position
The VANGL2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p13.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in the VANGL2 gene have been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and craniorachischisis.

## Function
The VANGL2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in planar cell polarity, a process that controls the orientation of cells within a tissue.

## AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID
Two amino acid mutations have been reported in the VANGL2 gene:
- p.Val239Gly (rs121908007)
- p.Pro236Leu (rs121908008)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations in the VANGL2 gene have been reported to date.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the VANGL2 gene have been associated with the following conditions:
- Spina bifida
- Craniorachischisis

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for VANGL2-related NTDs. Treatment is supportive and focuses on managing complications such as hydrocephalus, associated malformations, and motor deficits.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information on drug response in patients with VANGL2-related NTDs.
