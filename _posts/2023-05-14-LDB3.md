## Information on Gene LDB3

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 10: 87840757-87877720

**Function for gene:** LDB3 encodes a protein called LIM domain-binding 3 protein that is mainly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle. It plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of muscle tissue by interacting with other proteins to regulate gene expression.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000152583 
- OMIM ID: 605906 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9Y2G1 
- Aliases: ZASP, MLP, CMD1LF, CYPHER, LVNC3, CMD9, NMYOZ

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.L327* (truncating mutation) - rs786200026
- p.R190C (missense mutation) - rs104894546
- p.R272C (missense mutation) - rs747679552

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
No known somatic mutations reported yet.

**Related disease:** Mutations in LDB3 are linked to several neuromuscular diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and myopathy.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options depend on the type and severity of the disease. Treatment may include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgical interventions. Prognosis varies based on the specific disease and the patient's response to treatment.

**Drug response:** There is no specific drug approved for treating LDB3-related diseases. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive.
