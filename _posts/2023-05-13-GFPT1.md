# Information about Gene GFPT1

## Basic Information
- Gene Name: GFPT1
- Function: This gene encodes an enzyme called glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1, which is involved in the first step of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. This pathway involves the conversion of glucose to diverse sugar derivatives and modification of extracellular matrix proteins, transcription factors, and signaling molecules. The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is responsible for the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, which is an important donor substrate for protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. 

## Gene Model and Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 2
- Genomic Location: p13.3
- Alias: HBP, GFAT, KIAA0744

## External IDs
- HGNC: 4182
- NCBI Entrez: 2675
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115414
- OMIM: 138292
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P77839

## Mutations
- AA Mutation List: Some of the AA mutations associated with GFPT1 gene are R327H, L326P, S358P, R131C, S261P, R430C, etc.
- Mutation Type: Missense and Nonsense mutations.

## Related Diseases
- Congenital myasthenic syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. A study has found that mutations in GFPT1 gene can cause congenital myasthenic syndrome.
- Diabetes: Some studies have shown the association of GFPT1 gene with diabetes and its related complications.
- Obesity: GFPT1 gene is also associated with obesity.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for GFPT1 gene-related disorders. However, some studies have shown the potential of targeting the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway for the treatment of various diseases like diabetes, cancer, and inflammation.

## Drug Response
- Acetaminophen: A study has shown that acetaminophen can inhibit the activity of GFPT1 and reduce the production of UDP-GlcNAc.
- Benzylthiazolone: Another study has found that benzylthiazolone can inhibit the expression of GFPT1 by targeting its promoter region.
