# Information about gene COL9A1

## Genetic Position
- Gene: COL9A1 (collagen type IX alpha 1 chain)
- Genomic location: Chromosome 6q13-q14.1
- Pathway: ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion

## Pathology and Function
- Pathology: Mutations in the COL9A1 gene lead to a variety of connective tissue disorders, including Stickler syndrome and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED).
- Function: The COL9A1 gene encodes for the collagen type IX alpha 1 chain, which is essential for the formation of Type II collagen fibrils in the cartilage matrix.
