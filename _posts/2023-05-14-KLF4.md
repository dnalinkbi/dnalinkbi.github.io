# Information about Gene KLF4
## Genetic Position
- The KLF4 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 9 at position 9q31.2.

## Pathology and Function
- The KLF4 gene is a member of the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcription factors that regulate numerous biological processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
- KLF4 is involved in regulating stem cell fate, development, and cancer.
- In particular, KLF4 is known as a tumor suppressor that can prevent the formation and growth of cancer cells.
