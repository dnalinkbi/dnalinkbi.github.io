## Gene GARS

### Genetic Position
The GARS gene is located on chromosome 7q33.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the GARS gene have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D).

### Function
The GARS gene encodes a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family which is involved in protein synthesis by catalyzing the binding of amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported in the GARS gene.

### Related Disease
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in the GARS gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for CMT2D. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with mutations in the GARS gene.
