# Information about Gene MKKS

## Genetic Position
Gene MKKS (McKusick-Kaufman Syndrome) is located on chromosome 20 at position 20p12.2. It spans approximately 30 kilobases (kb) and contains 22 exons.

## Pathology and Function 
The MKKS gene is associated with the development of the McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the combination of genital anomalies (hydrometrocolpos in females and hypospadias in males), polydactyly, and congenital heart defects. The disease usually manifests at birth or shortly thereafter. The MKKS gene encodes a protein called makorin-1, which is thought to play a role in the development of cilia and flagella, cellular structures that are important in a variety of physiological processes, including the movement of sperm and the removal of debris from the respiratory tract.

## Related Disease
The mutations in the MKKS gene are associated with the development of McKusick-Kaufman syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis 
There is no cure for McKusick-Kaufman syndrome. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms. Surgical correction of genital anomalies and polydactyly may be necessary. Patients with congenital heart defects require specialized care. The long-term prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
No information is available regarding drug response.
