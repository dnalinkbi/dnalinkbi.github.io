# Genetic information analysis for gene ADH7

## Gene Overview
The ADH7 gene, also known as alcohol dehydrogenase 7, encodes an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of different types of alcohols, including ethanol. 

### Function
The primary function of the ADH7 gene is to produce the ADH7 enzyme, which catalyzes the reversible oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The enzyme plays a critical role in the metabolism of ethanol, which is converted to acetaldehyde by ADH7 as the first step in the process. 

### Genomic Location and External IDs

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some mutations have been identified in the coding region of ADH7 gene associated with alcoholism, although most of these are rare, with few being commonly found variations.
- The most common genetic variation is H47R, with R47 allele being associated with decreased alcohol metabolism.
- Other variations include I350V and T123M.
- dbSNP ID: rs11544690 for H47R variation.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are many somatic mutations reported in cancers associated with this gene as follows:
- missense mutations: G78C, D266N
- In-frame deletions: K181del, G190del
- dbSNP IDs: 
  * rs139726091 for G78C mutation.
  * rs879255420 for D266N mutation.
 
### Related Diseases
Variations in ADH7 gene and its expression levels have been linked to the following diseases:
- Alcoholism and alcohol-related disorders
- Cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for alcoholism. However, medications such as disulfiram and naltrexone can be used to help with the treatment of alcohol abuse. Treatment options for cancer depend on the stage of the disease and may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

### Drug Response
Individualsâ€™ drug response to alcohol can be affected by genetic variations. The R47 allele and other ADH7 variations are associated with the reduced metabolism of alcohol and increased risk of alcohol-induced side effects.
