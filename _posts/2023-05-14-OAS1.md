# Information on Gene OAS1

## Genetic Position and Pathology

Gene OAS1 is located on chromosome 12q24.2 [1]. OAS1 gene is a member of the Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family. It plays an important role in the immune response to viral infections. OAS1 expression is induced by interferons, which activates the OAS/RNAse L pathway that cleaves viral RNA and inhibits viral replication, and also leads to apoptosis in virally infected cells [2]. Genetic variations in the OAS1 gene have been associated with various viral infections and autoimmune diseases due to altered expression or function of the protein [3].

## Function for Gene

The OAS1 gene produces a protein called OAS1, which is responsible for producing oligoadenylate molecules that activate the RNAse L enzyme [4]. The RNAse L cleaves viral RNA and inhibits viral replication [5]. OAS1 is also involved in apoptosis, a mechanism that eliminates viral-infected cells to prevent the spread of viral infection [2].

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA mutations in the OAS1 gene that have been reported in dbSNP. Some of the common mutations are listed below:
- A to G at codon 151 (rs10774671)
- C to T at codon 128 (rs1050501)
- C to G at codon 99 (rs267673) 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the OAS1 gene in dbSNP database. Few of them are described below:
- A to C at codon 131 (rs768064026)
- T to C at codon 174 (rs148990634)
- G to T at codon 270 (rs11648801)

## Related Disease

Polymorphisms in the OAS1 gene have been associated with a number of viral infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) [6], West Nile virus (WNV) [7], and dengue virus [8] infections. Studies have also suggested that genetic variations in the OAS1 gene may be linked to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [9].

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment or cure for OAS1 gene-related disease. However, research is underway to investigate the potential use of interferons or other OAS activators in the treatment of viral infections as well as autoimmune diseases [10].

## Drug Response

The OAS1 gene has been shown to be involved in the response to certain drugs. For example, ribavirin, a drug used to treat viral infections such as HCV, is known to activate the OAS/RNAse L pathway, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication [11].
