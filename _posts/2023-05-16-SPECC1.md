# Gene Information Analysis for SPECC1

## Basic Information
- Gene name: Sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1 (SPECC1)
- Gene location: Chromosome 22q13.1
- Aliases: KIAA1981, SPCN1

## Function
The SPECC1 gene encodes a protein that contains two calponin homology domains and multiple coiled-coil domains. It has been suggested that SPECC1 plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and may be involved in the development of cilia and flagella.
