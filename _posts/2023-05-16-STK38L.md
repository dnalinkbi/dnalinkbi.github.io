## Information about gene STK38L

### Genetic Position:
The STK38L gene is located on chromosome 8 at the position 8q22.1.

### Pathology:
The STK38L gene is known to be associated with several types of cancer, including gastric and liver cancer. Studies have found that downregulation of STK38L expression can promote cancer cell proliferation and invasion.

### Function:
The STK38L gene encodes a protein called serine/threonine kinase 38-like, which is involved in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic location:
- Gene ID: 197170
- HGNC: 30170
- Ensembl: ENSG00000136589
- NCBI Entrez: 197170
- OMIM: 607684
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6P5W5
- Aliases: SGK038, SGK038B, SOK1B, STK38, STK38B, STK38L1

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several reported AA mutations in the STK38L gene, including:
- R5W (rs147907975)
- P14L (rs1799798)
- S33F
- T47M

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are several somatic mutations in STK38L reported in COSMIC database with dbSNP IDs, including:
- T20S (rs116034328)
- S32C (rs747805066)
- P33S (rs878853242)

### Related Diseases:
- Gastric cancer
- Liver cancer
- Prostate cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no specific treatment for STK38L-associated cancers. However, targeting the pathways regulated by STK38L may have therapeutic potential. Prognosis for STK38L-associated cancers is generally poor.

### Drug Response:
There is limited information available on drug response for STK38L-associated cancers.
