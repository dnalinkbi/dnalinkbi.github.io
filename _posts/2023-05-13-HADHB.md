# Gene Information for HADHB

## Summary
HADHB is a gene that encodes for the subunit beta of the enzyme 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase found in mitochondria. This enzyme is involved in fatty acid oxidation, and mutations in this gene can result in various diseases.

## Function 
HADHB is involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. Specifically, it catalyzes the last step of this process, which involves the cleavage of acetyl-CoA from a 3-ketoacyl-CoA molecule.

## Related disease
Mutations in HADHB have been linked to various diseases, including:
- Neonatal/infantile-onset of 3-ketothiolase deficiency (OMIM #203750)
- Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency (OMIM #609015)
- Short-Chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (OMIM #609925)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for diseases caused by mutations in HADHB, but the symptoms can be managed through diet, medication, and other treatments.

## Drug response
There is limited information on drug response for diseases caused by mutations in HADHB. However, some studies have suggested that a ketogenic diet may be beneficial for patients.
