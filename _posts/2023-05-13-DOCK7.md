## Gene Information
### Name and Symbol
- **Gene:** DOCK7
- **Aliases:**  
  - DOCK6
  - FLJ14859
  - FLJ25037
  
### Location
- **Chromosome:** 1
- **Genomic Position:** 62,901,594-63,202,315

## Function
The DOCK7 gene encodes for the DOCK7 protein, which is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization through its regulation of Rac-GTPases, which are involved in cell adhesion, spreading, and migration.
