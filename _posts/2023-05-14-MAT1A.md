# Information about Gene MAT1A
## Genetic Position
The MAT1A gene is located on chromosome 10q22.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the MAT1A gene can cause hypermethioninemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of methionine in the blood and urine.

## Function for gene
The MAT1A gene encodes the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthase, which catalyzes the formation of SAM, a universal methyl donor in numerous metabolic processes.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.5G>A (p.Ala2Thr), rs121912664
- c.97C>T (p.Ala33Val), rs121912666
- c.194G>A (p.Arg65Gln), rs121912665

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in the MAT1A gene.

## Related disease
- Hypermethioninemia
- Liver disease

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for hypermethioninemia. Treatment involves dietary restriction of methionine and supplementation with betaine and/or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).

## Drug response
There is no known drug response associated with mutations in the MAT1A gene.
