# Gene: TRHR

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 8
- Location: 8q23.3

## Pathology
- TRHR mutations have been associated with several thyroid-related disorders such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid cancer.

## Function
- The TRHR gene encodes the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the thyroid gland.
