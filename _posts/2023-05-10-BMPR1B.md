## **Information about Gene BMPR1B**

**Genetic Position**: BMPR1B gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 4 at position 31.21.

**Pathology**: Mutations in the BMPR1B gene are associated with various bone and joint disorders such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and congenital skeletal dysplasias.

**Function**: The BMPR1B gene encodes for a protein that belongs to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors. These receptors play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation, particularly in bones and joints.

**External IDs**:
- Gene ID: 658 (NCBI Entrez)
- Genomic location: Chr4:139059865-139078932 (Ensembl)
- Aliases: ALK6, CDw293, BMPRIB, TSR-I

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
- p.Asp275Glu (rs121908624): missense mutation
- p.Arg425Gln (rs121908625): missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for BMPR1B gene in dbSNP.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in BMPR1B gene are associated with various skeletal disorders including:
- Brachydactyly type A2 (OMIM: 112600)
- Congenital stapedial footplate fixation (OMIM: 184840)
- Acromesomelic dysplasia, Demirhan type (OMIM: 609441)
- Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OMIM: 602475)

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment options for skeletal disorders associated with BMPR1B mutations depend on the specific condition and severity of symptoms. Some patients may benefit from surgical interventions such as joint replacements or corrective surgery for bone deformities. Prognosis also varies depending on the disease and its severity.

**Drug Response**: There is currently no known drug that specifically targets BMPR1B gene mutations. However, some therapies used to treat osteoarthritis and osteoporosis may be beneficial for patients with mutations in this gene.
