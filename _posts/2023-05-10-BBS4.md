# Information about Gene BBS4

## Genetic Position
- BBS4 is located on chromosome 15q24.1, from base pair 72,084,153 to base pair 72,121,049.

## Pathology
- BBS4 mutations have been associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting multiple organs, including the eyes, renal system, and central nervous system.

## Function for gene
- BBS4 encodes a protein involved in the assembly and functions of the primary cilium. This organelle plays crucial roles in signaling, cell division, and sensory functions.
