## Gene GRM3

### Information about Gene:
- GRM3 stands for Glutamate Metabotropic Receptor 3.
- It is located on chromosome 1q32.1.
- The GRM3 gene has an encoded protein of 928 amino acids.
- It belongs to the group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, which plays a crucial role in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity.

### Function for gene:
- The GRM3 gene has a crucial role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory.
- This gene can control the activity of glutamate, which is an essential neurotransmitter in the brain.
- It can affect brain development and mood regulation.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- No somatic mutations reported in GRM3 gene until now.

### Related disease:
- Schizophrenia
- Major depressive disorder
- bipolar disorder

### Treatment and prognosis:
- Antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications are used to treat illnesses associated with the GRM3 gene.
- The prognosis of patients is based on the severity of the symptoms that they experience due to the related diseases.

### Drug response:
- Currently, there is no standard drug treatment specific to the GRM3 gene mutation.
