# Gene MSTN

**Function:** The gene MSTN encodes the protein myostatin, which is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Myostatin signaling leads to inhibition of muscle cell growth and differentiation.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 7550
- NCBI Entrez: 2660
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106799
- OMIM: 601788
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O14793

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg25Cys - missense mutation - rs121908662
- p.Asp76His - missense mutation - rs121908663
- p.Arg180Gly - missense mutation - rs121908664

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.431C>T - SNP - rs1805086
- c.445G>A - SNP - rs35781413
- c.542C>T - SNP - rs61755143

**Related disease:** Mutations in MSTN have been associated with muscle hypertrophy and reduced subcutaneous fat in humans. However, these mutations are rare and have not been linked to any specific disease.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there are no approved treatments for myostatin-related conditions. Some animal studies have suggested that blocking myostatin signaling could be a potential therapeutic approach to increase muscle mass.

**Drug response:** There is currently no drug available specifically targeting myostatin. However, certain drugs such as anabolic steroids have been known to increase muscle mass, but their use is associated with adverse side effects.
