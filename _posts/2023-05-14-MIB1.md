# Information about Gene MIB1

## Genetic Position

- Gene: MIB1
- Chromosome: 18
- Location: 18q11.2
- Strand: plus strand

## Pathology

MIB1 is associated with several pathologies such as tumors. It is used as a biomarker for cell proliferation activity and as a prognostic marker for various types of cancers.

## Gene Function

The MIB1 gene encodes a protein named Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1. This protein regulates the Notch signaling pathway which is essential for cell fate determination during development.
