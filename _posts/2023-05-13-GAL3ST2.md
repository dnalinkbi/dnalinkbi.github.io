## Gene: GAL3ST2

### Genetic Position
GAL3ST2 gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q11.2). It spans 6,512 base pairs and its coding sequence is 1,056 base pairs.

### Pathology
There is limited information available about the pathology of GAL3ST2 gene. However, altered expression of GAL3ST2 has been linked with various diseases, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colon cancer.

### Function
GAL3ST2 encodes for an enzyme that belongs to the sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme family. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to galactose residues in glycolipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. It is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and differentiation.
