# Gene Information: ADNP

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Location: 20q13.13

## Pathology
- ADNP-related disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in the ADNP gene.

## Function
- The ADNP gene codes for the activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), which is involved in neuronal development and the formation of the nervous system.

## External IDs
- HGNC ID: 24034
- NCBI Entrez ID: 23394
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000125845
- OMIM ID: 611386
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O95977

## Aliases
- Activity dependent neuroprotective protein
- KIAA0789
- ADNP1
- HUCA

## AA Mutation List
- p.Ile679Leu
- p.Tyr719Cys
- p.Phe628Ser

## Mutation Type
- Missense
- Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

## dbSNP ID
- rs137853825
- rs10491626
- rs141284425

## Related Diseases
- ADNP syndrome 
- Autism spectrum disorder 
- Schizophrenia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for ADNP-related disorders, and treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive.
- Early intervention with developmental therapies may improve outcomes.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug available for ADNP-related disorders.
