# Gene STAC3

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4q28.1
- **Pathology:** The STAC3 gene is not associated with any genetic disorders.
- **Function:** The STAC3 gene encodes the protein SH3 and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein 3, which is an important component of the voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav) in skeletal muscles. It regulates neurotransmitter release and participates in the excitation-contraction coupling process in muscle fibers.
