# Information about Gene MRE11A

### Genetic Position
- MRE11A is located on chromosome 11q21.
- The genomic position of MRE11A is from 98,907,838 to 98,992,915.

### Pathology
- Mutations in MRE11A have been associated with various cancer types, including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer.
- MRE11A mutations have also been linked to the genetic disorders ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS).

### Function
- The MRE11A gene encodes a protein called Meiotic Recombination 11 Homolog A.
- The protein is involved in DNA repair, meiotic recombination, and telomere maintenance.
- It plays a crucial role in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Some cancer treatment options for MRE11A mutations include PARP inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
- Prognosis varies depending on cancer type, stage, and other factors.

### Drug Response
- Some MRE11A mutations have been linked to resistance to certain cancer treatments, while others may be more sensitive to treatment with PARP inhibitors.
