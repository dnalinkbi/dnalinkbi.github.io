## Gene CBFB

### Genetic Position
- CBFB (core-binding factor subunit beta) gene is located on chromosome 16q22 in humans.

### Pathology
- CBFB gene is associated with several cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
- CBFB translocation with RUNX1 (AML1) gene is a recurrent genetic abnormality observed in approximately 25% of AML cases.

### Function
- CBFB encodes the beta subunit of the core-binding factor (CBF), a transcription factor complex.
- CBF is involved in regulating gene expression, particularly in hematopoietic cells, and plays a crucial role in the development of bone and cartilage.

### Related Disease
- CBFB gene mutations are associated with several malignancies, including:
    - Acute Myeloid Leukemia
    - Myelodysplastic Syndrome
    - Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
    - Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for CBFB-associated malignancies depend on the specific type and stage of cancer, but may include chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplantation, or targeted therapies.
- Prognosis also varies depending on the cancer type and stage, but certain mutations in CBFB may indicate a poorer prognosis.

### Drug Response
- CBFB-associated malignancies may respond to certain targeted therapies, such as FLT3 inhibitors or IDH inhibitors.
