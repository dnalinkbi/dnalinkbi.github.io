- Related disease: TMEM127 mutation has been associated with hereditary pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCC/PGL), a type of neuroendocrine tumor, as well as renal cell carcinoma and possibly other tumor types.

- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment and prognosis of TMEM127-related PCC/PGL can vary depending on the extent and location of the tumors. Surgery and/or targeted therapies may be used to manage the tumors.

- Drug response: The response of TMEM127-related PCC/PGL to drugs can vary based on the genetic alterations present in the tumors.
