## Gene CEP135

### Genetic Position
CEP135 (Centrosomal protein 135) is located on chromosome 4q12. 

### Pathology
Mutations in CEP135 have been associated with several disorders, including Short Stature with Microcephaly and Distinctive Facies (SSMDF) syndrome.

### Function
CEP135 is a centrosomal protein that plays a role in centrosome duplication and spindle assembly during cell division.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported non-synonymous mutations in CEP135 with their respective dbSNP IDs. These include:
- p.Asp398Asn (rs142665058)
- p.Arg1345Gln (rs765272821)
- p.Ala1725Val (rs766466728)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in CEP135.

### Related Disease
SSMDF syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, microcephaly, and distinctive facial features. Mutations in CEP135 have been identified as a cause of this syndrome.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for SSMDF syndrome. Treatment is mainly supportive and focuses on addressing the symptoms of the disorder. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specifically related to mutations in CEP135.
