# Information about Gene MPV17

(Markdown format)

## Genetic Position
The gene MPV17 is located on Chromosome 2 (chr2). The genomic coordinates as per GRCh38 are:  71,906,611 - 71,912,725 bp.

## Pathology
Mutations in the MPV17 gene have been associated with different types of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS), such as hepatocerebral MDS and Navajo neurohepatopathy.

## Function 
The MPV17 gene encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial function.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels identified in the MPV17 gene.

## Related Disease 
MPV17 gene mutations are associated with the following mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS):
- Hepatocerebral MDS
- Navajo neurohepatopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis 
There is no cure for hepatocerebral MDS or Navajo neurohepatopathy. Treatment is supportive and can include B-vitamin supplements, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. Prognosis is poor, and most patients with these conditions do not survive past childhood.

## Drug Response 
There is currently no drug available that targets the MPV17 gene or the associated mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes.
