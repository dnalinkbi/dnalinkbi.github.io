# Gene: INSL3

## Information

**Genetic Position:** 19p13.3

**Aliases:**
- RELAXIN/INSL3 family member 3
- Leydig insulin-like peptide
- Ley I-L
- INSL-L

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 6057
- NCBI Entrez: 3645
- Ensembl: ENSG00000105649
- OMIM: 607454
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60594

**Function:** The INSL3 gene encodes a protein called insulin-like 3 (INSL3). INSL3 is a hormone that is primarily produced in male Leydig cells, but has also been detected in female ovaries. INSL3 plays a role in male sexual differentiation in the developing fetus, as well as in adult male reproductive processes such as spermatogenesis and testosterone production.

## Mutations

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| R53H     | Missense | rs104894003 |
| A98V     | Missense | rs3741668 |
| L113F    | Missense | rs79472685 |
| Y118X    | Nonsense | rs79740855 |
| G129R    | Missense | rs78051876 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No known somatic mutations in the INSL3 gene have been reported in the literature.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the INSL3 gene have been associated with cryptorchidism in male infants. Cryptorchidism is a condition where one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for cryptorchidism often involves surgery to move the undescended testicle(s) into the scrotum. Prognosis is generally good, as long as the condition is treated in a timely manner.

## Drug Response

No known drugs specifically target the INSL3 protein, but drugs that regulate testosterone production and spermatogenesis (such as testosterone replacement therapy) may indirectly affect INSL3 function.
