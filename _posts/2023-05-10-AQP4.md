# Gene: AQP4

## Introduction
AQP4 (Aquaporin-4) is a water channel protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of water homeostasis in the brain and spinal cord. This gene is located on chromosome 18q11.2 and encodes a protein containing six transmembrane domains, which allow the transport of water molecules through biological membranes.

## Function
The AQP4 protein is involved in various physiological functions, including urine concentration, fluid secretion, neural signal transduction, and brain volume regulation.

## Related disease
Mutations in AQP4 have been associated with several diseases, including neuromyelitis optica (NMO), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cerebral edema.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment of AQP4-related diseases depends on the specific condition and the severity of the symptoms. There is currently no cure for NMO, but treatment can help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. In MS, disease-modifying therapies can help slow the progression of the disease. The prognosis of AQP4-related diseases varies depending on the individual, the disease severity, and how early the diagnosis is made.

## Drug response
Several drugs have been tested for the treatment of AQP4-related diseases, including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and monoclonal antibodies such as Rituximab.
