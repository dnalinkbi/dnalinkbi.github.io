## **Information about gene POMK**

### **Genetic position**
The POMK gene is located at chromosome 2p13.1.

### **Pathology**
The POMK gene has been associated with muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), which is a rare congenital muscular dystrophy that affects the brain and eyes. Mutations in POMK gene cause abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, leading to the formation of a defective extracellular matrix, and muscle and brain structural abnormalities.

### **Functions**
The POMK gene encodes a protein called protein O-mannose kinase (POMK), which plays an important role in O-mannosylation of α-dystroglycan.

### **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the POMK gene.

### **Related Disease**
- Muscle-eye-brain disease

### **Treatment and Prognosis**
There is currently no cure for muscle-eye-brain disease. Treatment for MEB is generally symptomatic and supportive, and may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupation therapy.

### **Drug Response**
There is no specific drug or treatment available for POMK gene mutations, but different therapeutic approaches are currently being researched.
