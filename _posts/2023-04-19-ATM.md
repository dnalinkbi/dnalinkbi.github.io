## Gene ATM
- Function: The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and repair pathways, cell cycle checkpoint control, telomere maintenance, and other cellular processes.
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 472 
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 11q22.3 
    - Aliases: AT1, ATC, ATA, TEL1
- External Sites:

    - NCBI Entrez: 472
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000149311
    - OMIM: 607585
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13315
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    - p.Glu1978Ter (rs121434487)
    - p.Thr759Ser (rs137853194)
    - p.Ser49Cys (rs137853195)

    - c.5778G>A (rs55886645)
    - c.7271T>G (rs121913451)
    - c.8316C>A (rs121913448)
    - Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) and Insertions/Deletions (InDels)
- Related disease: ATM deficiency causes a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular telangiectasias, immune system deficiencies, and an increased risk of malignancy.
- Treatment and prognosis: There is currently no cure for A-T, and treatment mainly focuses on ameliorating symptoms and complications.
- Drug response: There have been some attempts to develop specific drugs to treat A-T, such as the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019, which has shown promising results in vitro and in vivo studies.
