# CASP2 Gene Information

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7
- **Pathology:** Mutations in CASP2 gene have been associated with various forms of cancer and neurological disorders.
- **Function:** The CASP2 gene encodes for Caspase 2, a member of the caspase family of cysteine proteases, which plays a crucial role in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and DNA damage response pathways.

## Gene Identification and Aliases
