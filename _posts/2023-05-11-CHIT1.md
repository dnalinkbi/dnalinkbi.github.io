## CHIT1 Gene Information

- **Function:** The CHIT1 gene encodes for the enzyme chitotriosidase, which is responsible for the degradation of chitin.


- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC: 1946
    - NCBI Entrez: 1118
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000119888
    - OMIM: 600031
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00528
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 1q32.1
    
    
- **Aliases:** Chitotriosidase, chitinase 1


- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Glu186Asp - missense variant - rs121909712
    - p.Val10Met - missense variant - rs61748590
    - p.Leu341Phe - missense variant - rs121909713
    - p.Glu442Ala - missense variant - rs121909714


- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.


- **Related Diseases:** Mutations in CHIT1 have been associated with susceptibility to pulmonary aspergillosis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and other fungal infections.


- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for CHIT1-related diseases, but treatment involves managing symptoms and preventing infections. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and any associated complications.


- **Drug Response:** Studies have suggested that Captopril and Enalapril can reduce chitotriosidase activity, indicating a potential treatment avenue for CHIT1-related diseases.
