# Gene Information Analysis: ATP6AP2

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

* **Genetic Position**: ATP6AP2 is a gene that is located on the X chromosome at position Xq28. 

* **Pathology**: Variants in ATP6AP2 are associated with prostate cancer, breast cancer, and hypertension.

* **Function**: ATP6AP2 encodes for ATPase H(+)-transporting lysosomal accessory protein 2 (ATP6AP2), which is a multifunctional protein involved in lysosomal acidification, cellular trafficking, and regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

## Gene Information

* **Function for Gene**: ATP6AP2 encodes for ATPase H(+)-transporting lysosomal accessory protein 2 (ATP6AP2), which plays an important role in lysosomal acidification, cellular trafficking, and regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
