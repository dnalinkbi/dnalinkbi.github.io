# Information about gene PDSS1

## Genetic Position
PDSS1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 24.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PDSS1 gene have been associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the mitochondria. This deficiency can lead to various phenotypes, including encephalomyopathy, renal failure, and fatal infantile multisystemic disease.

## Function
The PDSS1 gene encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10, which is an essential component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. Coenzyme Q10 is important for the production of ATP, which is the main energy source for cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the PDSS1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the PDSS1 gene have been associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency, which can lead to various phenotypes, including encephalomyopathy, renal failure, and fatal infantile multisystemic disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for coenzyme Q10 deficiency typically involves supplementation with exogenous coenzyme Q10, which can improve symptoms. However, the prognosis is highly variable and depends on the severity of the condition and the age at onset.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to mutations in the PDSS1 gene.
