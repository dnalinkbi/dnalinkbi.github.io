# Information about Gene FGF8

## Genetic Position
- FGF8 is located on the chromosome 10 at position 123,276,253-123,282,337.

## Pathology
- FGF8 has been associated with various pathological conditions, including facial and limb development, craniosynostosis, and several types of cancer.
- The overexpression of FGF8 has been linked with the development of different types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, and stomach cancer.

## Function
- FGF8 plays a critical role in embryonic development and tissue patterning. It is involved in the development of several organs, including the brain, limbs, inner ear, and skeleton.
- Additionally, FGF8 is also involved in wound healing, tissue repair, and angiogenesis.
