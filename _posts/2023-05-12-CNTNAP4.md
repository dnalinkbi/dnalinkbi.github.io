## Gene Information

### Gene Name
CNTNAP4

### Function
The CNTNAP4 gene encodes a protein called contactin-associated protein-like 4, which is a neural adhesion molecule and a member of the neurexin superfamily. It plays an important role in the development and maintenance of synapses in the central nervous system.

### External IDs
- HGNC:25182
- NCBI Entrez:26047
- Ensembl:ENSG00000151640
- OMIM:610014
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q9UHC6

### Genomic Location
The CNTNAP4 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.2.
