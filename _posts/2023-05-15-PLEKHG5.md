# Information about Gene PLEKHG5

## Genetic Position

The gene PLEKHG5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1, specifically at the genomic position 1q21.3.

## Pathology

Mutations in the PLEKHG5 gene have been associated with Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2L. This disorder is characterized by progressive muscle weakness that affects the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles.

## Function for Gene

The PLEKHG5 gene encodes a protein called Pleckstrin Homology Domain-Containing Family G Member 5 (PHG5) that is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Several amino acid (AA) mutations have been identified in the PLEKHG5 gene. These mutations are associated with Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2L and include:

- p.R257X (rs758808508)
- p.L531P (rs142898887)
- p.R542C (rs137979627)
- p.F418L (rs150962215)

The types of mutations that have been identified include non-sense, missense, and frameshift.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is no available information on somatic SNVs/InDels for PLEKHG5

## Related Disease

Mutations in PLEKHG5 are associated with Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2L, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2L. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, aimed at managing muscle weakness and preventing complications. The prognosis for affected individuals is generally poor, with a progressive deterioration of muscle function and eventual wheelchair dependence.

## Drug Response

There is no available information on drug responses for PLEKHG5.
