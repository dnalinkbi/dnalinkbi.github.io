# Gene MTHFS

## Information 

- **Genetic Position:** 1p36.33
- **Pathology:** Nothing known
- **Function:** MTHFS gene encodes a protein that has both folylpolyglutamate synthetase and folylpolyglutamate hydrolase activities. The encoded protein catalyzes formation of the methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) from folate and glutamate, and also hydrolyzes the polyglutamate tail of MTHF.
