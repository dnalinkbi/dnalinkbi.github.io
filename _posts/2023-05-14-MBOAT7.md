## Gene MBOAT7

### Genetic position and aliases

- Genomic location: Chromosome 19: 43670463-43707941
- Gene ID: 79977
- Aliases: FKSG76, LPIAT1, OACT3

### Function

The MBOAT7 gene encodes for a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). These are important phospholipids that play a role in signaling pathways and membrane trafficking.
