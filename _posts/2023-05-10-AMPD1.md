## Gene Information for AMPD1

### Pathology
AMPD1 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which functions in the breakdown of nucleotides. Mutations in this gene have been associated with myopathies, including exercise-induced muscle pain and myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

### Function
The AMPD1 gene provides instructions to make the adenosine monophosphate deaminase enzyme, which converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is used for energy production in cells. This process is important in skeletal muscle during high-intensity exercise, where there is an increase in AMP levels, leading to an increase in AMPD1 activity.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- HGNC: 478
- NCBI Entrez: 275
- Ensembl: ENSG00000133087
- OMIM: 102770 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23109

AMPD1 is located on chromosome 1 (1p13.2).

Aliases: AMPD, MADA

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Asp52Asn (rs17602729)
- p.Val368Met (rs121434568)
- p.Pro320Leu (rs121434567)

Mutations in AMPD1 can result in amino acid changes in the adenosine monophosphate deaminase enzyme and lead to myopathies.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs and Indels in AMPD1 with dbSNP IDs. These include:
- rs121434566
- rs121434565
- rs121434564

### Related Disease
Mutations in AMPD1 have been associated with myopathies, including exercise-induced muscle pain and myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, but it can be managed through exercise and diet modifications. Exercise-induced muscle pain can be treated with rest, physical therapy, and medications.

### Drug Response
There are no known drugs specifically targeting AMPD1 gene mutations. However, certain medications may be used to manage symptoms of myopathies associated with these mutations.
