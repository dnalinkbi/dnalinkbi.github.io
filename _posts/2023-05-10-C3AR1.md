## Information about Gene C3AR1

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 12q13.13
- **Pathology:** C3AR1 gene has been implicated in various diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease.
- **Function for gene:** The C3AR1 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in the inflammatory response. It binds to the complement component C3a, which triggers the release of proinflammatory mediators.
- **Aliases or other names:** C3AR, C3aR, CD88, AZ3B, L-CCR
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 1359
    - NCBI Entrez: 719
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000139445
    - OMIM: 113995
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P30990
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several non-synonymous mutations reported in the C3AR1 gene. Some of them include:
    - p.Gly41Arg (rs116165232)
    - p.Ala58Val (rs2274567)
    - p.Thr85Ile (rs17216707)
    - p.Asp238Asn (rs1047283)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic mutations reported in C3AR1 gene, such as:
    - c.360+1G>A (rs587776794)
    - c.428C>T (rs758674349)
    - c.859-1G>A (rs763880132)
- **Related disease:** C3AR1 gene has been linked to various diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** The C3AR1 receptor is a potential therapeutic target for various inflammatory diseases. Various drugs, such as SB 290157 and SB 234551, have been developed to target this receptor.
- **Drug response:** As mentioned earlier, drugs targeting the C3AR1 receptor have been developed and have shown promising results in preclinical studies.
