# Information about gene GTF2IRD2

## Genetic Position
The GTF2IRD2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p11.2).

## Pathology
Alterations in the GTF2IRD2 gene have been associated with Williams-Beuren Syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and cardiovascular problems.

## Function
The GTF2IRD2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. It has been shown to interact with other proteins involved in transcription and chromatin remodeling.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 4655
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 9569
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000106484
- OMIM ID: 605461
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9UNU6

Aliases: 
- BIRD-2
- GTF3

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported in the GTF2IRD2 gene:
- p.Lys18Arg (rs371938505)
- p.Asp121Asn (rs796052583)
- p.Val251Met (rs148502949)
- p.Ala284Val (rs786202631)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic variants in the GTF2IRD2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in GTF2IRD2 have been associated with Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), which is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body and is characterized by cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and cognitive impairment, among other symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for WBS, and treatment is mainly focused on managing symptoms and providing support to affected individuals and their families. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and associated health complications.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug specifically targeting GTF2IRD2 at this time.
