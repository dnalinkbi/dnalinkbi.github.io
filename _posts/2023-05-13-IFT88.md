# Gene: IFT88

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 13
- Location: 13q13.2

### Pathology and Function
- The IFT88 gene encodes for intraflagellar transport protein 88, which is involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, flagella and centrosomes. Mutations in this gene cause various ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis, autosomal recessive, and Senior-Loken syndrome.
