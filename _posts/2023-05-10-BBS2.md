## Gene BBS2

- Function: The BBS2 gene encodes a protein involved in the development and maintenance of cilia, which are microtubule-based organelles that have important roles in sensory perception, cell signaling and motility.

- External IDs: HGNC:9564, Entrez Gene: 583, Ensembl: ENSG00000169378, OMIM: 606151, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NFJ9

- AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID:
  - p.Thr304Met (missense, rs80338852)
  - p.Ala361Thr (missense, rs80338853)
  - p.Arg404Ter (nonsense, rs121908481)
  - p.Tyr430Cys (missense, rs80338854)

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - c.1223delT (frameshift, rs80269964)
  - c.1283G>A (missense, rs80338855)
  - c.1318C>T (missense, rs80338856)

- Related disease: BBS2 is associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body including vision, obesity, kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability.

- Treatment and prognosis: there is no cure for Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, but treatments can help manage symptoms.

- Drug response: Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting BBS2 gene mutations.
