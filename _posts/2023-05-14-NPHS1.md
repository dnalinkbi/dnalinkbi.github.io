## Gene: NPHS1

### Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 19: 40343497-40373313
- **Pathology:** Mutations in NPHS1 have been linked to congenital nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder that causes excessive protein loss in the urine and can lead to kidney failure.
- **Function:** The NPHS1 gene provides instructions to make nephrin, a protein that plays an essential role in the normal functioning of the kidney's filtration system.
- **Aliases:** Nephrin, NPHN, NPHNE
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 7989
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 4868
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105679
    - OMIM: 602716
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60500

### Mutations
- **AA mutation list:**
    - Several missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations have been identified in NPHS1 that contribute to congenital nephrotic syndrome.
- **Mutation type:**
    - Missense/nonsense/frameshift
- **dbSNP ID:**
    - rs587777005

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
- **dbSNP ID:**
    - None reported yet

### Related Disease
- **Disease:** Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome
- **Symptoms:** Frequent infections, swelling, and protein in the urine
- **Genetic variants:** Mutations in NPHS1 are the most common cause of congenital nephrotic syndrome, accounting for up to 50% of all cases.
- **Mode of inheritance:** Autosomal recessive

### Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment of congenital nephrotic syndrome typically involves supportive care, such as controlling blood pressure and managing infections. In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.
- Gene therapy has been explored as a potential treatment option for congenital nephrotic syndrome caused by mutations in NPHS1.
