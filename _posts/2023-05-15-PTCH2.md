# Analysis of Gene PTCH2 #

## Gene Information ##

**Gene:** PTCH2

**Aliases:** PTC2

**Function:** The PTCH2 gene is a member of the patched gene family and encodes a transmembrane receptor protein that functions as a negative regulator of the hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in a variety of important biological processes including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and stem cell regulation.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 9610
- NCBI Entrez: 8643
- Ensembl: ENSG00000168720
- OMIM: 603673
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96AC3

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1, 168,700,925 - 168,831,960 bp

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** None reported.

## Pathology and Related Diseases ##

**Related Diseases:** PTCH2 mutations have been associated with holoprosencephaly, which is a rare birth defect characterized by abnormal brain development and facial features. Other diseases associated with the hedgehog signaling pathway include basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis ##

Currently, there is no specific treatment for PTCH2-related diseases. Treatment options depend on the type and severity of the disease and may include surgical interventions, medications, and/or physical therapy. The prognosis for individuals with PTCH2-related diseases also varies depending on the type and severity of the disease.

## Drug Response ##

There is currently no information available on drug response for PTCH2-related diseases.
