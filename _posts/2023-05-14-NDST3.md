# Information about Gene NDST3 

## Genetic Position 

Gene NDST3 (N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase 3) is located on human chromosome 4q25 and has 15 exons. 

## Pathology 

Mutations in the NDST3 gene have been associated with multiple diseases including retinitis pigmentosa, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. 

## Function 

NDST3 is involved in the process of Golgi sulfotransferases, which are responsible for sulfating various proteoglycan molecules, matrix molecules, and lipids. This gene plays a vital role in the development and migration of axons in the nervous system.
