# Gene: RAD54L

## Information
RAD54L is a gene located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p33-p32.3. It is also known as DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54L. 

## Function
The RAD54L gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA repair process and recombination. It is a member of the SWI/SNF family of DNA-dependent ATPases and serves as a key enzyme in homologous recombination process.

## Disease
Variants in the RAD54L gene have been associated with cancer. Studies have suggested its involvement in the development of osteosarcoma, colorectal, and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of RAD54L gene mutations depends on the type and severity of the cancer.

## Drug response
There is no specific drug available that targets the RAD54L gene mutation. However, studies are ongoing to find the potential drugs that can be used for targeted therapy.
