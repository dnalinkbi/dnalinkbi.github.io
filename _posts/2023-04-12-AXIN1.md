# Information about gene AXIN1

## Position
The AXIN1 gene is located on chromosome 16q22.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the AXIN1 gene are associated with several types of cancer, including colorectal, hepatocellular, and gastric cancers. These mutations can lead to abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in many cellular processes such as embryonic development and cell proliferation.

## Function
The AXIN1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Specifically, the AXIN1 protein forms a complex with other proteins that degrade beta-catenin, a protein that is normally stabilized by the Wnt pathway.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 896

- c.2822C>T (missense) rs1421251746
- c.1069A>G (missense) rs199768152

## Related disease
- Colorectal cancer
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Gastric cancer 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Patients with AXIN1 mutations may benefit from targeted therapies that inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway. The prognosis for these patients varies depending on the type and stage of the cancer.

## Drug response
Some pre-clinical studies have shown that inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, such as ICG-001 and PRI-724, can be effective in treating AXIN1-mutant cancers. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy for these patients.
