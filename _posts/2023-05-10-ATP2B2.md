# Information on Gene ATP2B2

## Genetic Position
The gene ATP2B2 is located on chromosome 3 at the genomic position 3p25.2.

## Pathology 
Mutations in ATP2B2 have been associated with hypertension in animals, and there is some evidence of involvement in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases in humans.

## Function
ATP2B2 encodes a calcium-dependent plasma membrane ATPase that mediates cell signaling by regulating calcium levels in cells, particularly in muscle cells.
