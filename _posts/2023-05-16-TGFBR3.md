## Information on Gene TGFBR3

### Genetic Position
The gene TGFBR3 (Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 3) is located on chromosome 1q32.2.

### Pathology
TGFBR3 mutations have been associated with a variety of cancers, including breast, lung, and colon cancer. Studies have suggested that TGFBR3 plays an important role in tumor suppression.

### Function
TGFBR3 is a transmembrane proteoglycan receptor that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It is a receptor for several ligands, including TGF-Î² isoforms, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and growth differentiation factors (GDFs).

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC:11852 
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 7049 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000143156 
- OMIM: 600742 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q03167 
- Aliases: betaglycan; OI9 

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations in TGFBR3 that have been reported to be associated with cancer. Some examples include:

- R334C (rs121908001) 
- R334H (rs79991787) 
- R334S (rs121908002) 
- R334W (rs121908003)

These mutations are all located in the extracellular domain of the receptor and are predicted to be deleterious.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations in TGFBR3 have been reported in various cancers. Some examples include:

- c.1009A>G (rs11540652) 
- c.1099G>A (rs34549813) 
- c.1768C>T (rs555920886)

### Related Disease
TGFBR3 mutations have been associated with several types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colon cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments targeting TGFBR3 mutations. However, studies have suggested that TGFBR3 could be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available regarding drug response and TGFBR3 mutations.
