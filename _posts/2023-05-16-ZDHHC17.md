# Gene: ZDHHC17

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: X
- Start Position: 73,652,492 bp
- End Position: 73,657,025 bp

## Function
The ZDHHC17 gene encodes a member of the DHHC palmitoyltransferase family, which are responsible for the palmitoylation of proteins. Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that plays an important role in the localization and function of many proteins.
