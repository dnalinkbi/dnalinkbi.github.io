# Information about Gene PSMC3IP 

## Gene Position and Aliases
- Gene Name: PSMC3IP
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q24.3
- Alias(es): SIP, SKP1, and Beta-TRCP Binding Protein 

## Function
- PSMC3IP encodes for a protein that plays a role in regulating both the cell cycle and DNA damage response. It interacts with Skp1 and Cullin 1 and is part of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) complex that controls protein degradation by ubiquitylation.
