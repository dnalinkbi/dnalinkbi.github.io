# Gene: TACSTD2

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 1
- Start position: 188,594,079 bp
- End position: 188,605,851 bp

## Pathology and Function

TACSTD2, also known as TROP2 (trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2), is a membrane protein that belongs to the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) family of proteins. It has been associated with several types of cancers, including breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinomas. TACSTD2 plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.
