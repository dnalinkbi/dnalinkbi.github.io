# Information about Gene SLC4A2

## Genetic Position
SLC4A2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at the position 7q35. It spans a region of approximately 53.8 kb.

## Pathology and Function
The SLC4A2 gene encodes a protein called Anion exchange protein 2 (AE2). AE2 is expressed in a variety of tissues including red blood cells, kidney, and pancreas. It functions as an anion exchanger that exchanges bicarbonate and chloride ions across the cell membrane. Mutations in the SLC4A2 gene are associated with various disorders including renal tubular acidosis and distal RTA.

## Related Disease
- Renal Tubular Acidosis, Distal, Autosomal Recessive (OMIM #266140)
- Renal Tubular Acidosis, Proximal, with Ocular Abnormalities and Mental Retardation (OMIM #604278)
- Osteopetrosis with Renal Tubular Acidosis (OMIM #259730)

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis involves the use of alkali therapy to correct metabolic acidosis. Alkali therapy may include oral sodium bicarbonate, citrate, or sodium/potassium citrate. The long-term prognosis of the disease depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
The drug response of distal renal tubular acidosis varies depending on the individual case. Alkali therapy is the primary treatment, however, it may not work equally well in all patients. In some cases, the use of acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) may be beneficial.
