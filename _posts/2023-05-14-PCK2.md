# Information about gene PCK2


## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- Gene: PCK2
- Genomic location: Chromosome 14q22.1
- Pathology: PCK2 gene is associated with gluconeogenesis, a metabolic pathway that is important in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.
- Function: PCK2 gene encodes a key enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 which catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the gluconeogenesis pathway.
