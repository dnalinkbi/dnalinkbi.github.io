# Gene RGPD3

## General Information

RGPD3 gene encodes for a protein known as RANBP2-like and GRIP domain-containing protein 3, which is a member of the RGPD protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of conserved RANBP2-like and GRIP domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The precise function of RGPD3 is not well known but it is believed to be involved in cellular signaling and regulation.

## Function of Gene

The precise function of RGPD3 is not well understood. However, RGPD3 is believed to participate in signaling and regulation processes in the cell.
