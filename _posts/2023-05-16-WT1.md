# Information about gene WT1

## Genetic Position
The gene WT1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13).

## Pathology
The WT1 gene is associated with several diseases such as Wilms tumor, Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, and WAGR syndrome.

## Function for gene
The WT1 gene encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the kidneys and gonads. It is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.
