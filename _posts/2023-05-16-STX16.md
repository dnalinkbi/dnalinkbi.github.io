## Gene STX16

### Genetic Position and Pathology
STX16 gene is located on Chromosome 20, starting from base pair position 30,333,636 to 30,416,486. This gene is associated with various pathological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.

### Function
STX16 is a member of the syntaxin family of proteins that plays an important role in vesicle fusion, a process critical in neurotransmitter release. STX16 is primarily involved in the fusion of autophagic vesicles to lysosomes in a process known as autophagy.
