## Gene: STX17

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 4
- Start Position: 1,373,408 bp
- End Position: 1,382,349 bp

### Pathology and Function
- STX17 gene is involved in the formation of autophagosomes, which is a process of cell degradation and recycling of cellular components.
- It has been linked to various pathological conditions like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases.
