## Gene VCAN

### Basic Information
- Function: This gene encodes a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. The encoded protein is an integral part of the extracellular matrix in cartilaginous tissue and plays an essential role in intervertebral disc development and function.
- External IDs: Gene ID: 1462, Genomic location: Chromosome 5: 137,264,755-137,346,171, 
Aliases: CSPG2, Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2
- External Sites: HGNC: 2510, NCBI Entrez: 1462, Ensembl: ENSG00000116062, OMIM: 155760, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13611

### Mutations
- AA mutation list: p.Val569Alafs*10, p.Gly623Asp, p.Pro742Leu, p.Arg1199Gln, p.Val1297Leu, p.Ala1840Pro
- Mutation type: missense, frameshift, and nonsynonymous
- dbSNP ID: rs2277786, rs138498639, rs3737576, rs3737577, rs369538081, rs111033623, rs3774761, rs34766034, rs146550830

### Somatic Mutations
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: rs756108246, rs780214071, rs886037624, rs544201970, rs555862401, rs569586041

### Related Disease
- Disease: Wagner syndrome 1; Multiple Sclerosis; Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy 2; Vitreoretinopathy, proliferative; Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA
- Inheritance: Autosomal dominant; Multifactorial inheritance; Autosomal recessive

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: There is currently no specific treatment for VCAN-related diseases, and treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
- Prognosis: The prognosis varies depending on the disease severity and affected individuals’ presentation.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug response regarding the VCAN gene.
