# Information about Gene GATM

## Genetic Position
The GATM gene is located on chromosome 15q21.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GATM gene have been associated with the rare genetic disorder Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency. This disorder affects the synthesis of creatine, leading to intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, and behavioral problems.

## Function for Gene
The GATM gene encodes the enzyme guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, which plays a key role in the synthesis of creatine. Creatine serves as an energy reservoir in cells, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as muscle and brain.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no publicly available information on somatic variants in the GATM gene.

## Related Disease
Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency) is a rare genetic disorder that has been associated with mutations in the GATM gene. The disorder affects the synthesis of creatine, leading to intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, and behavioral problems.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for GAMT deficiency, but treatment with creatine supplements and a low-arginine diet may improve symptoms. The long-term prognosis for affected individuals varies, depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited research on drug response in individuals with GAMT deficiency.
