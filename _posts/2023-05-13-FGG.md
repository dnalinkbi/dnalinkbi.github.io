# Gene FGG

## Information

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 4:155,410,885-155,420,635
- **Pathology**: N/A
- **Function**: Fibrinogen Gamma (FGG) is involved in blood coagulation and wound healing.
- **Aliases**: FGG, FGB, Fib, Fbg, BG; fibrinogen gamma chain; fibrinogen beta chain; fibrinogen alpha chain
- **External IDs**: HGNC:3676, NCBI Entrez:2266, Ensembl:ENSG00000171557, OMIM:134820, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P02679

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List**: There are various mutations associated with the FGG gene. Some of the most common ones include:
  - p.Ala341Thr, rs2066865
  - p.Asn308Ser, rs2066861
  - p.Arg95Trp, rs34175813
  - p.Gly67Cys, rs200811364
  
- **Mutation Type**: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)

## Related Disease

- Fibrinogen Gamma Chain Deficiency
- Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
- Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for Fibrinogen Gamma Chain Deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition. In some cases, clotting factor concentrates may be given to patients to increase their ability to clot blood. In severe cases, fibrinogen replacement therapy may be necessary.
- The prognosis for Fibrinogen Gamma Chain Deficiency is generally good, but it may depend on the severity of the condition and any associated health issues.

## Drug Response

- There is no known drug specifically for Fibrinogen Gamma Chain Deficiency, but patients may benefit from therapies such as clotting factor concentrates or fibrinogen replacement therapy.
