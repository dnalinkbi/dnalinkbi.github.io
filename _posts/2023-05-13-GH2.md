# Information on Gene GH2

## General Information

- Gene: GH2 (growth hormone 2)
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 4269
    - NCBI Entrez: 2689
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000115263
    - OMIM: 139250
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01241
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q23.3
- Aliases: GH-N, GH1B, hGH-N, IGHD2, pituitary growth hormone 2, somatotropin

## Function

GH2 encodes a protein called somatotropin, which is also known as growth hormone (GH). GH2 is expressed in the pituitary gland and is responsible for stimulating growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. 

## Mutations and Variations

- AA mutation list: Several missense mutations have been identified in GH2, including G47R, R77C, and R179C. 
- Mutation types: Missense mutations
- dbSNP ID: rs121912913, rs121912914, rs121912915

## Related Diseases

Mutations in GH2 are associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and short stature in children. However, GH2 mutations are relatively rare and are not a common cause of GHD. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment for GHD depends on the underlying cause and can include recombinant GH therapy, which involves injecting synthetic GH to promote growth and development. The prognosis for individuals with GHD varies depending on the severity and underlying cause of the condition.

## Drug Response

GH therapy can improve growth and development in individuals with GHD. However, like any medication, recombinant GH therapy can have side effects and may not be effective for everyone.
