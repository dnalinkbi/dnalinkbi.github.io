## NEB gene

The NEB gene encodes the protein nebulin, which is important for muscle contraction. Mutations in this gene can cause various muscle disorders.

### Function
The nebulin protein plays a key role in muscle cell structure and function. It helps regulate the length of the thin filaments in muscle fibers, which are necessary for smooth muscle contractions.
