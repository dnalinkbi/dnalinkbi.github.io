## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** SLC6A14

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4, position 4q28.3

**Aliases:** ATB0,+; Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent neurotransmitter transporter B(0+); B(0+)AT; PRO0846

**Function:** SLC6A14 encodes a protein that belongs to the solute carrier family 6. The protein encoded by this gene is a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter and their substrates include some neurotransmitters, amino acids, and urea.
