## Gene Information

### Gene Name and Alias

- Gene Name: NUTM2D
- Alias: C6orf211

### Function of Gene

- NUTM2D is involved in chromosomal translocation in tumors, particularly in NUT midline carcinoma (NMC).

### Genomic Location

- Chromosome: 6
- Start Position: 43774337 bp
- End Position: 43819462 bp

### External IDs

- HGNC: 47213
- NCBI Entrez: 29127
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125007
- OMIM: 610713
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6ZUB2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported AA mutations for NUTM2D in dbSNP.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels on NUTM2D in dbSNP.

### Related Disease

- NUT Midline Carcinoma (NMC)

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, there are no specific treatments for NMC, but several clinical trials are underway.
- NMC is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, although some patients may respond well to intensive chemotherapy.

### Drug Response

- There is currently no specific drug approved for NMC. However, several drugs targeting the fusion partner of NUTM2D, including BET inhibitors, have shown promise in preclinical studies.
