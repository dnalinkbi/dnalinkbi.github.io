# GM2A Gene Information Analysis

## General Information
- Gene Name: GM2A (GM2 ganglioside activator)
- Genomic Position: Human chromosome 5 (5q31.3)
- Aliases: SAP3, SAP-3, GM2-AP

## Function
GM2A encodes for a protein that acts as a cofactor for lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase A. In conjunction with this enzyme, GM2A is involved in the breakdown of ganglioside GM2 in the lysosome. GM2A is responsible for binding to GM2 ganglioside and presenting it to beta-hexosaminidase A for enzymatic degradation.

## Related Disease
Mutations in GM2A are associated with GM2-gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain and other tissues. The disease can manifest in three forms: Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and GM2-gangliosidosis AB variant.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for GM2-gangliosidosis, and treatment options are limited. Treatment is primarily supportive and focused on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response specific to mutations in GM2A. Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy have been explored as potential treatment options for GM2-gangliosidosis, but their effectiveness varies depending on the type and severity of the disease.
