## Gene: NFKB2

### Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 10
- Location: 10q24.32

### Pathology

NFKB2 gene abnormalities are associated with several diseases, including immune disorders, infections, and cancer. Mutations in this gene have been linked to primary immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, and lymphoproliferative diseases.

### Function

The NFKB2 gene encodes for a protein called p100, which is a precursor to the transcription factor protein, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). NF-κB plays a critical role in regulating immune responses, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell growth. The p100 protein functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB, preventing its activation until it undergoes specific proteolytic cleavage.

### Related Disease

- Immunodeficiency 16 (IMD16)
- CD40 ligand deficiency
- Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
- B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for NFKB2 gene-related disorders. Treatment strategies usually focus on managing the symptoms and improving the patient's quality of life. For example, patients with CVID may receive immunoglobulin replacement therapy to supplement their deficient antibodies.

### Drug Response

Several drugs that target the NF-κB pathway are being investigated for their potential in treating cancer and autoimmune diseases. Some examples include bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide.
