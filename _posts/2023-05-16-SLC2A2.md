## Information about Gene SLC2A2

### Genomic Location and Aliases

SLC2A2 gene is located on chromosome 3q26.1 and is also known as GLUT2.

### Function

The SLC2A2 gene encodes a protein called glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). This protein is a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, which helps transport glucose in and out of cells. GLUT2 is mainly expressed in the liver, pancreas, and small intestine, where it plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the SLC2A2 gene have been associated with several types of diabetes, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2), type 2 diabetes, and neonatal diabetes mellitus.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for MODY2 and neonatal diabetes mellitus usually involve insulin therapy and dietary modifications. Patients with type 2 diabetes may require additional medications, such as metformin or sulfonylureas, to manage their blood glucose levels. The prognosis for individuals with SLC2A2 mutations varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of their treatment.

### Drug Response

Studies have shown that individuals with SLC2A2 mutations may respond differently to certain diabetes medications, such as sulfonylureas. Therefore, genetic testing may help inform treatment decisions for these patients.
