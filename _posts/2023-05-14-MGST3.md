# Information on Gene MGST3

## Genetic Position
- MGST3 is located on Chromosome 1, at position q24.2

## Pathology
- MGST3 has been linked to several diseases including liver cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and breast cancer. 

## Function
- MGST3 encodes for a protein that belongs to the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) family. It plays a role in protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation.
