# Information on Gene PAX8

**Genetic Position:** PAX8 gene is located in the chromosomal region 2q13.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the PAX8 gene have been associated with the development of various types of cancer, including thyroid cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer.

**Function of Gene:** The PAX8 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of various organs, including the thyroid gland, kidney, and MÃ¼llerian system.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 8617

- Ensembl: ENSG00000104936
- OMIM: 167415
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q06710

**Aliases:** AN-3, Mullerian duct transcription factor 1, paired box gene 8

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** 
There are numerous AA mutations in the PAX8 gene associated with various types of cancer. Some of the commonly observed mutations are:
- c.1022C>T (p.Arg341Cys), rs41290994
- c.506G>A (p.Arg169His), rs587782885
- c.395C>T (p.Pro132Leu), rs140739321

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are several Somatic SNVs/InDels in the PAX8 gene, including:
- c.264C>T, rs143198384
- c.255C>A, rs137853039
- c.166C>T, rs74491949

**Related Disease:** 
- Papillary thyroid carcinoma
- Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
- Serous ovarian carcinoma

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Therapeutic targeting of PAX8 gene expression is an emerging area of investigation. Prognosis varies depending on the cancer type and stage.

**Drug Response:** The response to drugs targeting the PAX8 gene is yet to be fully explored.
