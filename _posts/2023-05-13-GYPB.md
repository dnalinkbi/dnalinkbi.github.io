# Gene Information for GYPB

## Basic Information
- Function: The protein encoded by GYPB gene belongs to the glycosyltransferase family that transfers a sugar molecule from one molecule to another. This gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein of red blood cells (RBCs) that carries antigens of the MNS (MNSD) blood group system.
- External IDs:
    * Gene ID: 2992
    * Genomic Location: Chromosome 4,  39,732,590-39,736,391
    * Aliases: MNS, GPB, GPBa, GYP(B)D, MNS1, MNS2

## Variation Information
- AA Mutation List:
    * Some of the amino acid substitutions in Glycophorin B are as follows:
        - Ala17Val
        - Arg35Gln
        - Arg40His
        - Gly84Cys
        - Gly98Asp
        - Ala124Val

- Mutation Type:
    * Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)
    * Missense Mutation

- dbSNP ID: rs6152, rs1143679, rs76664273, rs117595533, rs138901768, rs137852142, rs28442278

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- There is no cure for the Gerbich blood group system antigen deficiency.
- Patients with Gerbich blood group system antigen deficiency usually do not show any symptoms.
- Treatment is not required for asymptomatic individuals.

## Drug Response:
- There are no drugs that are known to specifically target Gerbich blood group system.
