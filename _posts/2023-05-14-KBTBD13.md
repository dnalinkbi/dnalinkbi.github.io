## Gene Information

**Gene name:** KBTBD13

**Function:** KBTBD13 is involved in protein ubiquitination, which plays a role in regulating transcriptional activation and protein degradation.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 29067
- NCBI Entrez: 220074
- Ensembl: ENSG00000151809
- OMIM: 616734
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8TEA8 

**Aliases:** KLHL13, KBTBD12, FLJ14668

## Mutations

**AA mutation list:** 
- Gln109Arg (rs750538630)
- Ala275Thr (rs776213775)

**Mutation type:** Missense mutations

**dbSNP ID:** rs750538630, rs776213775

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
None reported

## Pathology

**Related disease:** KBTBD13 mutations have been associated with nemaline myopathy 11 (NEM11), a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and respiratory problems.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, no specific treatment exists for NEM11. Treatment is generally supportive and may include respiratory support or physical therapy. Prognosis varies depending on disease severity, but individuals with NEM11 may have a reduced lifespan.

## Drug response

No information available on drug response.
