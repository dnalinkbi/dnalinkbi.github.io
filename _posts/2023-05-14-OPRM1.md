# Information about OPRM1 gene

## Gene position, pathology, and function

**Gene position:** The OPRM1 gene is located on chromosome 6q24-q25.2.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the OPRM1 gene have been associated with altered pain sensitivity and susceptibility to opioid addiction.

**Function:** The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu-opioid receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to endogenous opioid peptides and exogenous opioid drugs such as morphine and fentanyl. Activation of the mu-opioid receptor produces analgesia, as well as euphoria and addiction in some individuals.

## Gene information

**Function:** Mu-opioid receptor

**Aliases:** MOR, OPRM, MOP, OPRM1R, MOR1

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are several somatic variations in the OPRM1 gene. One example is:

| E428K   | GAG>AAG         | rs1051660 |

## Related diseases

Some of the diseases associated with the OPRM1 gene are:
- Opioid addiction
- Chronic pain
- Alcohol dependence

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there are no treatments targeting the OPRM1 gene specifically. However, medications that target the mu-opioid receptor, such as opioid analgesics, are widely used for the treatment of pain. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in OPRM1 depends on the severity of the mutation and its effect on opioid sensitivity.

## Drug response

Individuals with certain genetic variations in the OPRM1 gene may respond differently to opioids. For example, carriers of the rs1799971 variant have been shown to have lower pain sensitivity and require higher doses of opioids for pain relief. Other genetic variants may increase the risk of opioid addiction.
