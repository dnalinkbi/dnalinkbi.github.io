## Gene: REL

### Gene information
- **Function:** The REL gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and activation of the immune system. It regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and cell survival.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 5966
    - Genomic location: Chr2:255,603,672-255,793,833
    - Aliases: C-Rel
