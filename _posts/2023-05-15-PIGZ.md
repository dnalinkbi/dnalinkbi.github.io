# Gene Information for PIGZ

### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

The PIGZ gene is located on chromosome 3 and is associated with the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are complex molecules made of carbohydrates and lipids that function to anchor proteins to the cell membrane. PIGZ has been found to be involved in the early stages of GPI anchor biosynthesis.

### Function

The function of PIGZ is to add the first mannose to the GPI anchor precursor, which is necessary for the subsequent transfer of more mannose residues and the completion of the anchor. This gene is therefore crucial for ensuring proper protein localization and function in the cell membrane.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Currently, there is no known pathogenic AA mutation list for PIGZ

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there is no known pathogenic Somatic SNVs/InDels for PIGZ

### Related Disease

Mutations in PIGZ have been linked to hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation (HPMR). HPMR is characterized by elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and mental retardation.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for HPMR is supportive and focuses on managing symptoms, such as developmental delays and seizures. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response

Currently, there is no known drug response for PIGZ.
