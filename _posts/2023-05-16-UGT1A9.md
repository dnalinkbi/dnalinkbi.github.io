## Gene UGT1A9

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic Position**: UGT1A9 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A9) gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q37.1).
- **Pathology:** Several genetic variants in the UGT1A9 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism and may contribute to inter-individual variability in drug efficacy and adverse effects.
- **Function of the gene:** The UGT1A9 gene encodes a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) protein family. These enzymes are responsible for the glucuronidation of various endogenous compounds such as bilirubin, as well as xenobiotics including drugs and environmental toxins. The glucuronidation process is a crucial step in the elimination of these compounds from the body.

### Treatment and prognosis

Genetic variations in UGT1A9 gene can potentially impact an individual's response to drugs that are substrates for UGT1A9. In particular, patients with Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome may experience increased risk of adverse drug reactions due to reduced UGT1A9 activity. The knowledge of a patient's UGT1A9 genotype may help in adjusting drug dose and reducing adverse events.

### Drug response

UGT1A9 plays a role in the metabolism of several drugs, including irinotecan, mycophenolic acid, and propofol. Genetic variations in UGT1A9 may impact an individual's response to these drugs. For example, patients with the UGT1A9*3/*3 genotype may have a reduced ability to metabolize drugs like irinotecan, which could result in increased toxicity and adverse events.
