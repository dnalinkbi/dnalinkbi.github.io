# Information about Gene TROVE2

## Basic Information
- Gene: TROVE2
- Genomic location: Chromosome 2 (2q31.1)
- Aliases: 
    - TEP1
    - SSB
    - SSB/La

## Function
The TROVE2 gene encodes a protein called SSB/La (Sjogren syndrome antigen B). SSB/La is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein which is involved in various cellular processes including RNA metabolism, translation and RNA export. It specifically recognizes the 3'-terminal UUU-OH of RNA with high affinity and is required for the initiation of RNA polymerase III transcription.

- OMIM: 109090
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P05455

## AA Mutation and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA mutations reported in the TROVE2 gene along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID. They are as follows:

| Amino Acid Change | Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------------|------|----------|
| Y160C | missense | rs137853014 |
| L119F | missense | rs137853013 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

At present, there are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the TROVE2 gene.

## Related Disease

TROVE2 gene is associated with several autoimmune diseases including:
- Lupus erythematosus
- Primary biliary cirrhosis
- Scleroderma
- Sjogren's syndrome

## Treatment & Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatment options for TROVE2-associated diseases. However, the treatment usually involves the management of symptoms such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunomodulatory drugs. The overall prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to the treatment.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available regarding the drug response of TROVE2-associated diseases.
