# **Gene: SLC26A4**

## Information
- Gene function: SLC26A4 is a gene that encodes a protein called Pendrin, which is involved in regulating the pH balance of the inner ear and thyroid gland.
- External IDs: HGNC: 10968, NCBI Entrez: 5172, Ensembl: ENSG00000140463, OMIM: 605646, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y647.
- Genomic location: Chromosome 7q31.3.

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: The SLC26A4 gene has several mutations including V239D, G497R, H723R, IVS7-2A>G, M467T, and T416P.
- Mutation type: Missense, nonsense, splicing, and frameshift mutations.
- dbSNP ID: rs111033240, rs111033233, rs111033235, rs12470651, rs879255603, rs143232118.

## Related Diseases
- Pendred Syndrome: A disorder characterized by hearing impairment and an enlarged thyroid gland. It is caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene.
- DFNB4: An autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing disorder caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: There is currently no cure for Pendred Syndrome, but hearing aids and thyroid hormone replacement therapy can help manage symptoms.
- Prognosis: The prognosis for individuals with Pendred Syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- Salicylates: Salicylates have been shown to improve hearing loss in some individuals with Pendred Syndrome.
