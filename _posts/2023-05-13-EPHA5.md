# Gene EPHA5

**Genetic Position:** Chr 4:74,097,970-74,787,768

**Pathology:** EPHA5 gene encodes a member of the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family. It plays a critical role in axon guidance and cellular adhesion during embryonic development.

**Function:** EPHA5 plays a crucial role in several cellular activities, including neuronal development, tissue regeneration, and angiogenesis. It mediates signal transduction events that regulate many processes, including cell attachment, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

**External IDs:** HGNC:3451, NCBI Entrez: 2044, Ensembl: ENSG00000138668, OMIM: 179680, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P54756

**Aliases:** EHK3, HEK11, EHK-3, ETK1, EPHA3-HUMAN, Epha5.

**Related disease:** Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has been linked to EPHA5 mutations.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for ASD, but several treatments may improve the symptoms. Depending on the symptoms, the treatment includes behavioral therapies, medication, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.

**Drug response:** There is no known drug response associated with EPHA5 mutations in ASD patients.
