## Gene Information Analysis Report: SOHLH1

### Genetic Position
SOHLH1 gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 9 (9q34.3). It spans about 21.78 kb of genomic DNA and includes 5 exons.

### Pathology and Function 
SOHLH1 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. It plays a key role in the development and maturation of germ cells in both males and females. Mutations in SOHLH1 gene can cause various types of reproductive disorders such as infertility, premature ovarian failure, and testicular dysfunction.

- Aliases: Germ cell-specific helix-loop-helix protein 1, Spermatogenesis- and oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1, helix-loop-helix protein 40

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported in SOHLH1 gene. Some of them include:
- S92R (rs146132630): Missense mutation that changes serine to arginine at position 92.
- G103D (rs149523813): Missense mutation that changes glycine to aspartic acid at position 103.
- P105H (rs144618262): Missense mutation that changes proline to histidine at position 105.
- R114C (rs140277061): Missense mutation that changes arginine to cysteine at position 114.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported yet for SOHLH1 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in SOHLH1 gene have been associated with various types of reproductive disorders such as infertility, primary ovarian insufficiency, and spermatogenic failure.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for SOHLH1-related disorders. However, assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) may help some couples to conceive.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug available for SOHLH1-related disorders.
