# Information about gene B4GALT1

## Genetic Position

The B4GALT1 gene is located on chromosome 9q21.33.

## Pathology and Function

The B4GALT1 gene encodes for the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, which initiates the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and other glycoconjugates. Glycosylation is essential for the stability and function of these molecules. Mutations in B4GALT1 have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called GM1-gangliosidosis, which causes neurological symptoms and developmental delays.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic mutations in B4GALT1 in the COSMIC database.

## Related Disease

Mutations in B4GALT1 have been associated with GM1-gangliosidosis, a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system. Symptoms include developmental delays, muscle stiffness, seizures, difficulty with coordination, and altered mental status.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for GM1-gangliosidosis. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and includes physical therapy, medication, and other interventions to manage symptoms.

## Drug Response

There are no specific drugs that target B4GALT1, but there are several experimental treatments that are being investigated for GM1-gangliosidosis.
