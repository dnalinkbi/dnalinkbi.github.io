# Gene LCE3B 

## Genetic Position
The gene LCE3B (late cornified envelope protein 3B) is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1q21.3.

## Pathology
Polymorphisms in the LCE3B gene are associated with psoriasis, a chronic skin disease characterized by inflammation and skin scaling.

## Function 
The LCE3B gene encodes for a protein that contributes to the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure which provides mechanical strength to the outermost layer of the skin.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations reported in the LCE3B gene, some of the most common are:
- p.Ala194Val (rs28420247)
- p.Arg230His (rs140708)
- p.Gln494* (rs758370752)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the LCE3B gene, some of the most common are:
- c.316G>A (rs41274270)
- c.479C>T (rs200842554)
- c.495A>G (rs56122623)

## Related Disease
LCE3B gene polymorphisms are associated with psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Current treatments for psoriasis include immune system suppressors, phototherapy, and topical treatments to reduce inflammation. The prognosis for psoriasis varies, and it is largely dependent on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs specifically targeting the LCE3B gene, but research is ongoing to develop more effective treatments for psoriasis.
