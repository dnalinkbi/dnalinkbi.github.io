## Gene XRCC5

### Genetic Position
The gene XRCC5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q35.

### Pathology
XRCC5 is known to be associated with various types of cancers, including prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. 

### Function of Gene
The XRCC5 gene encodes for a protein called Ku80, which is a component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). The protein Ku80, together with the protein Ku70, forms a heterodimer known as Ku, which is involved in DNA repair. Specifically, the Ku heterodimer recognizes and binds to double-stranded DNA breaks, a process which initiates the repair of the break.

### Related Disease
XRCC5 is associated with various types of cancer including prostate cancer and ovarian cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in the XRCC5 gene. Treatment for associated cancers often involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with cancers associated with XRCC5 mutations depends on the stage and grade of the cancer.

### Drug Response
There is no information available about drug response pertaining to mutations in XRCC5.
