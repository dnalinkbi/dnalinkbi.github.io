# Information about gene TMEM126A

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11q14.1

### Pathology
- The gene TMEM126A has been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency which can result in Leigh syndrome.

### Function
- TMEM126A is involved in the assembly and stability of mitochondrial complex I, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production in the body.

### External IDs
- HGNC: 31099
- NCBI Entrez: 84272
- Ensembl: ENSG00000205656
- OMIM: 615362
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NWT6

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.5G>A, p.Met2Ile, rs150271555
- c.155G>A, p.Arg52His, rs773810948
- c.296G>A, p.Arg99His, rs144669063
- c.407G>A, p.Arg136Gln, rs201381212

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in TMEM126A.

### Related Disease
- Leigh syndrome: a rare mitochondrial disease that affects the brain and nervous system. Symptoms include developmental delays, seizures, breathing problems, and muscle weakness.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for Leigh syndrome. Treatment typically involves managing the symptoms through medications, physical therapy, and respiratory support.
- The prognosis for individuals with Leigh syndrome can vary depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specifically for TMEM126A mutations.
