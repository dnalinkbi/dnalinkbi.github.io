# Gene ECI1

**Genetic position:** ECI1 gene is located on chromosome 1, specifically at position 1p36.33.

**Pathology:** The dysfunction or abnormality of ECI1 has been associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.

**Function:** The ECI1 gene encodes an enzyme called enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, which plays a critical role in the metabolism of fatty acids and their derivatives.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC ID: 3184
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 1635
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000117360
- OMIM ID: 600334
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P42126
- Aliases: DCI, ECHD, ETZ2, NSCLBP1

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are numerous mutations reported in the ECI1 gene. Some examples include:
- c.548C>T (p.Arg183Cys) rs76393990
- c.172G>A (p.Gly58Asp) rs138296910
- c.472G>T (p.Ser158Ile) rs113234358

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic mutations reported in the ECI1 gene. Some examples include:
- c.581A>T (p.Asn194Tyr) rs63750606
- c.482C>T (p.Thr161Ile) rs369722407
- c.404C>T (p.Thr135Met) rs76509125

**Related disease:** Abnormalities or dysfunction of the ECI1 gene have been associated with various diseases such as:
- Alzheimer's disease
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Schizophrenia
- Non-small cell lung carcinoma

**Treatment and prognosis:** There are currently no specific treatments available for ECI1-associated disorders. Treatment usually involves managing the symptoms of the underlying disease. The prognosis depends on the severity of the associated disease.

**Drug response:** There is currently no known drug response specifically associated with the ECI1 gene.
