# Gene NDUFB3 

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location
The gene NDUFB3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at the position 2q33.3. The genomic coordinates of the gene are 206,588,217-206,591,026 bp (GRCh38.p13).

## Pathology and Function of Gene
The NDUFB3 gene encodes NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 3 protein, which is involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process in the mitochondria. The protein acts as a part of respiratory complex I and is responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone during ATP production. Mutations in the NDUFB3 gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by decreased activity of complex I, resulting in various neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.

## Somatic SNVs/Indels with dbSNP ID
According to the COSMIC database, various somatic mutations including missense mutations, frameshift, and stop-gain mutations have been reported in the NDUFB3 gene.

## Related Disease
Defects in the NDUFB3 gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency and are responsible for various neurodegenerative disorders including Leigh syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for mitochondrial complex I deficiency associated with NDUFB3 mutations. The treatment mainly involves symptomatic and supportive care. The prognosis varies based on the severity, type, and extent of the mutations.

## Drug Response
Data regarding drug response involving NDUFB3 gene mutations is currently limited.
