## Information about gene COL4A4

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 2q36.3
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the COL4A4 gene are associated with autosomal dominant and recessive Alport syndromes, which are inherited kidney diseases that affect the glomerular basement membrane and can lead to kidney failure.
- **Function for Gene**: The protein encoded by the COL4A4 gene is a type IV collagen alpha chain, which is a major component of basement membranes. It helps to maintain the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane in the kidneys and is also present in other tissues such as the ear and eye.
- **External IDs and Aliases**:
     - HGNC: 2201
     - NCBI Entrez Gene: 1287
     - Ensembl: ENSG00000159105
     - OMIM: 120131
     - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P53420
     - Aliases: COL4A4, ASLN, ATS, HANAC
     
### Mutations and Variants

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Several missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations have been reported in the COL4A4 gene as causative of Alport syndrome. Some examples include:
     - Missense mutation p.Glu924Lys (rs267606730)
     - Nonsense mutation p.Arg632* (rs104886452)
     - Frameshift mutation p.Ser1204fs (rs398122259)
     - Splicing mutation c.1741+1G>A (rs267606523)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are no reported somatic mutations or variants in the COL4A4 gene.
     
### Related disease

- **Related Disease**: Alport syndrome, inherited kidney disease that leads to progressive renal failure
- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is no cure for Alport syndrome, but treatment may include controlling high blood pressure, using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and dialysis or kidney transplant in cases of kidney failure.
- **Drug response**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs are the most effective drugs in treating Alport syndrome. However, response to these drugs may vary depending on the type of genetic mutation present in the patient.
