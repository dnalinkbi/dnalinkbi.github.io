# Gene Information Analysis for VPS35

## Basic Information

- **Name**: VPS35 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 Homolog)
- **Aliases**: PARK17, RP11-445L22.3
- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 16q11.2

## Function

The VPS35 gene encodes a retromer complex protein that is involved in endosomal protein trafficking. This protein acts as a cargo-selective subunit of the retromer complex which is responsible for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking retrograde transport. VPS35 interacts with several proteins to coordinate retrograde trafficking of various ligands.

## External IDs

- **HGNC ID**: 26834
- **NCBI Entrez**: 55737
- **Ensembl ID**: ENSG00000185264
- **OMIM ID**: 614203
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: Q96QK1

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List**: p.Asp620Asn, p.Ala553Val, p.Gly51Asp, and many more
- **Mutation Type**: Missense, frameshift, synonymous, etc.
- **dbSNP ID**: rs74315327, rs34990582, rs756614536

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the VPS35 gene have been linked to various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Abnormal protein accumulation in brain cells is a shared pathology in these diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for neurodegenerative diseases linked to VPS35 gene mutations. Treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the disease and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

Studies have shown that retromer dysfunction caused by VPS35 mutation leads to aberrant lysosomal sorting and accumulation of autophagic substrates. This finding provides a rationale for developing therapeutic strategies that modulate retromer activity. A recent study suggests that small-molecule enhancers of VPS35 function could improve endosomal-anomalies and provide a potential therapy for PD.
