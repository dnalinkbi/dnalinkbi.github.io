## Gene IGKC Information

### Genetic Position

- IGKC gene is located on chromosome 2, at the position 2p12.

### Pathology

- The IGKC gene mutations are associated with an increased risk of develop multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells.

### Function

- The IGKC gene encodes the kappa light chain of IgG and IgA immunoglobulins, which are antibodies produced by plasma cells in the immune response.

### External IDs and Aliases

- Gene ID: 3515
- Genomic Location: Chr2:88,071,937-88,084,225
- Aliases: IGK@, MGC117189

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- No known mutations are reported in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No known somatic mutations are reported in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease

- Multiple Myeloma

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Multiple myeloma treatment varies according to the stage of the disease, patient's age, and overall health status. The treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, and targeted cancer drugs.
- The prognosis of multiple myeloma is generally poor, with a 5-year survival rate of around 50%.

### Drug Response

- IGKC gene might be a potential target for cancer drugs that targets plasma cells and the immune response.
