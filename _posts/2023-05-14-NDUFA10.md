### Related Disease
- NDUFA10 mutations have been linked to mitochondrial complex I deficiency.
- Defects in the NDUFA10 gene are associated with Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial complex I deficiency, and other mitochondrial disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency or related disorders. Treatment is mainly supportive and aims to improve symptoms and slow disease progression.
- The prognosis for patients with NDUFA10 mutations varies depending on the severity of the mutations and the degree of organ involvement.

### Drug Response
- There is no specific drug treatment available for NDUFA10-related mitochondrial disorders. However, some drugs, such as Coenzyme Q10 and Idebenone, have shown to improve mitochondrial function in some cases.
