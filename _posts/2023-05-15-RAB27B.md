# Gene Information

## Gene: RAB27B

### Function
RAB27B (RAB27B, member RAS oncogene family) encodes a small GTPase protein involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. It is specifically involved in the regulation of lysosome-related organelles, including melanosomes and lytic granules in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and platelet dense granules.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic variants in RAB27B with a dbSNP ID.

### Related Disease

Mutations in RAB27B have been linked to Griscelli Syndrome type 2 (GS2), an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pigmentary dilution and severe cellular immunodeficiency.

### Treatment and Prognosis

The primary treatment for GS2 is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which has been shown to improve lifespan and quality of life for patients. The prognosis for GS2 varies depending on the severity of the disease, but early intervention is associated with better outcomes.

### Drug Response

There is currently no available information on drug response for RAB27B mutations.
