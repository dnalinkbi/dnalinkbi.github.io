## Gene: 

The gene of interest is GOT1 (Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase 1), which is located on chromosome 10q24.1.

## Function:

The GOT1 gene encodes a protein which is involved in the transfer of the amino group between aspartate and glutamate during the process of amino acid metabolism. This protein is an important enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is responsible for energy production in the cell.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

- No AA mutations were found associated with GOT1 gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

- No somatic SNVs/InDels were found associated with GOT1 gene.

## Related disease:

Mutations in the GOT1 gene have been related to susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Several studies have shown that changes in the expression levels of the GOT1 gene are also associated with various types of cancers including breast, liver, and colorectal cancers.

## Treatment and prognosis:

As the changes in the expression level of GOT1 gene are related to various types of cancers, the level of its expression can be useful for identifying the prognosis of cancer patients and might serve as a therapeutic target for the development of cancer treatments.

## Drug response:

There is currently no known drug that specifically targets GOT1 gene.
