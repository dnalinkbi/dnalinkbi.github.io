### Gene SMAD1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4, region q31.21\
**Pathology:** SMAD1 gene is associated with various cancers including colorectal, ovarian, prostate, and breast cancer. It also plays a role in bone formation and development.\
**Function:** SMAD1 encodes a protein that belongs to the SMAD family of signal transduction proteins. It plays a role in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth and differentiation.
