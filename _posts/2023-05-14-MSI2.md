## Genetic Information Analysis on Gene MSI2

### Overview
MSI2 is a gene located on chromosome 17q22 that encodes for an RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in regulating normal stem cell function. It is also associated with various diseases.

### Function
The protein encoded by MSI2 gene binds to and stabilizes mRNAs, thereby regulating the translation of proteins that control stem cell proliferation and differentiation.
