## Gene FGD1
FGD1 (faciogenital dysplasia 1) is a human gene located on the X chromosome at Xp11.21. This gene encodes a protein called FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domain-containing protein 1 (FGD1), which is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation.

### Gene function
FGD1 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the Rho GTPase family members Cdc42 and Rac1, which play a critical role in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell shape changes. FGD1 has been implicated in the development and maintenance of several organs and tissues, including the face, limbs, genitalia, and nervous system.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several missense mutations have been described in the FGD1 gene that cause Aarskog-Scott syndrome (ASS), an X-linked genetic disorder characterized by facial and digital abnormalities, short stature, and genital anomalies. Some of these mutations are:

|AA Change|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---------|------------|--------|
|p.Glu787Lys|Missense|rs121909776|
|p.Pro778Thr|Missense|rs121909777|
|p.Arg406Cys|Missense|rs121909736|
|p.Asn542Tyr|Missense|rs121909741|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations reported in the FGD1 gene.

### Related disease
Mutations in the FGD1 gene are known to cause Aarskog-Scott syndrome (ASS), an X-linked recessive disorder that affects 1 in 25,000 males. ASS is characterized by facial, skeletal, and genital anomalies, as well as varying degrees of intellectual disability.

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment of ASS is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on correcting any physical abnormalities and addressing developmental delays. Prognosis is generally good, with most individuals able to live relatively normal and productive lives.

### Drug response
There are currently no known drugs targeted specifically at the FGD1 gene or its protein product.
