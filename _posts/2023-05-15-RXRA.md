# Information about Gene RXRA

## Gene Position
- Gene: RXRA (Retinoid X Receptor Alpha)
- Location: Chromosome 9q34.2
- Length: 54,213 bases

## Function
- RXRA is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It forms a heterodimer with other nuclear receptors, such as NR1H3 and NR1H4, and regulates the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, development, and differentiation.
