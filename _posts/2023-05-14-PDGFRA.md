## Gene PDGFRA

**Pathology:** Mutations in the PDGFRA gene have been linked to several cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

**Function:** The PDGFRA gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein that binds to PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor). This binding activates signaling pathways that can lead to cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation.

**External IDs, location and Aliases:**

- HGNC: 8803
- NCBI Entrez: 5156
- Ensembl: ENSG00000134853
- OMIM: 173490
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16234
- Genomic location: Chromosome 4q12

Aliases: PDGFR2, CD140 antigen-like family member A

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

- D842V (missense) rs114900525
- D842Y (missense) rs121913476

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- c.2303G>A (p.D768N) rs267607155
- c.2304T>G (p.D768E) rs121913477

**Related disease:** Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

**Treatment and prognosis:** Targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib has been successful in treating GISTs that have PDGFRA mutations. Prognosis depends on the cancer stage and treatment response.

**Drug response:** PDGFRA mutations are associated with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib.
