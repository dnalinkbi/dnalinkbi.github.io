## Gene Information
**Gene:** TRPM7 (Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 7)\
**Function:** TRPM7 is a protein-coding gene which encodes a member of the transient receptor potential subfamily which is involved in calcium-permeable cation channels and non-selective cation channels. This gene is mostly expressed in the heart, brain, and kidney.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the TRPM7 gene are associated with a variety of diseases including:
- Primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
- Left Ventricular Noncompaction 6
- Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 46

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for TRPM7 related diseases. Treatment is based on managing the symptoms of the disease. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and varies by the specific condition. 

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs that specifically target TRPM7. However, some drugs that target calcium channels may provide some relief for some TRPM7-related symptoms.
