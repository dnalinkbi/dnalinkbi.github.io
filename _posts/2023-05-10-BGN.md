## Gene: BGN

### Function
BGN (Biglycan) encodes a small leucine-rich proteoglycan which is involved in bone metabolism, collagen fibrillogenesis, cellular growth, and apoptosis. It interacts with various extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and modulates their functions. 

### External IDs and Locational aliases
- HGNC ID: 1049
- NCBI Entrez ID: 633
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000184036
- OMIM ID: 301870
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P21810
- Genomic Location: Chromosome X:76,673,195-76,687,029

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported in BGN such as:
- R48Q (rs150529353)
- E102K (rs140978946)
- G154D (rs55655637)
- P241H (rs764932670)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID have been reported for BGN.

### Related diseases
- Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, X-linked with mental deterioration (OMIM: 300055)
- Osteoporosis (OMIM: 166710)

### Treatment and prognosis
The treatment of BGN-related disorders is mainly symptomatic and supportive. A definite cure is not available. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the disease progression. 

### Drug response
Currently, there is no FDA-approved drug available for the treatment of BGN-related disorders.
