# Information about Gene RAPSN

## Genetic Position

- The RAPSN gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p11.2).
- It spans approximately 9.9 kb and contains 7 exons.

## Pathology

- Mutations in the RAPSN gene have been associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome, which is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder.
- These mutations disrupt the function of the RAPSN protein, which plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction.

## Function

- The RAPSN gene encodes the receptor-associated protein of the synapse (RAPSN) protein, which is a postsynaptic protein that interacts with the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and plays a crucial role in the clustering and stability of AChRs at the neuromuscular junction.
- RAPSN is essential for the formation of the synaptic cleft and the proper functioning of neuromuscular junctions.

## External IDs and Aliases

- External IDs: HGNC:9833, NCBI Entrez Gene:5910, Ensembl:ENSG00000110354, OMIM:601592, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:O00161
- Aliases: 43KDA, CMS5D, HMN7A, RJS

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- Several AA mutations in the RAPSN gene have been documented to be responsible for congenital myasthenic syndrome.
- Examples of mutation types and associated dbSNP IDs include: 
    - Frameshift mutation: dbSNP ID rs200569330
    - Missense mutation: dbSNP ID rs1048940209
    - Nonsense mutation: dbSNP ID rs797044197

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Not applicable; the RAPSN gene is not known to be associated with somatic mutations.

## Related Disease

- Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for CMS include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, 3,4-diaminopyridine, salbutamol, and ephedrine.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the specific mutation present.

## Drug Response

- There is currently no information available on drug responses specific to mutations in the RAPSN gene.
