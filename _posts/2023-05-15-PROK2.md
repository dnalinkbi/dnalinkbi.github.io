### Gene Information for Gene PROK2

The PROK2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 at the position 12.1. This gene encodes for a protein called prokineticin 2. The protein synthesized from this gene is a signaling molecule that plays a role in various physiological processes in the body including neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation.

### Function for Gene PROK2

The prokineticin 2 protein encoded by PROK2 gene is involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes in the body, including the development of sensory neurons, migration of neurons, regulation of circadian rhythm, and sexual differentiation.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases

The external IDs for PROK2 gene are as follows:
- HGNC: 9457
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 60675
- Ensembl: ENSG00000121060
- OMIM: 607002
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HC23

Other known aliases for the PROK2 gene are:
- BBS9
- MGC14833
- PROK2OS

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

The dbSNP database lists several variants in the PROK2 gene. Below are some of the known variants with their type and dbSNP ID:

| Variant | Type    | dbSNP ID     |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Ile139Asn| Missense| rs2277694    |
