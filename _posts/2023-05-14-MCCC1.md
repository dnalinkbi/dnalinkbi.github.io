## Gene: MCCC1

### Introduction

MCCC1 is a gene that encodes for the methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase 1 enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the carboxylation of a substrate in the leucine catabolic pathway.

### Function

The MCCC1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays a vital role in the breakdown of an amino acid called leucine. The enzyme, methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase 1, helps to convert a molecule called "methylcrotonoyl-CoA" into a molecule called "methylglutaconyl-CoA," which can then be further processed and used for energy production.

- c.1094G>A (p.Arg365His) - rs104894231
- c.1103C>T (p.Arg368Cys) - rs104894232
- c.1145G>A (p.Arg382Gln) - rs778579722

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic single-nucleotide variations and insertions/deletions affecting the MCCC1 gene that have been reported in several cancer types. The following is a list of some of the more common somatic mutations:

- c.709T>C (p.Leu237Ser) - rs1554835087
- c.430G>A (p.Arg144Gln) - rs1554835088
- c.620C>T (p.Arg207Cys) - rs1554835089
- c.737C>T (p.Arg246Cys) - rs1554835090

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the MCCC1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Methylcrotonylglycinuria
- Leukoenchephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate
- Autosomal Recessive Stickler Syndrome Type 2

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for diseases caused by MCCC1 mutations, but treatments are available to address some of the symptoms. For example, individuals with methylcrotonylglycinuria may be placed on a low leucine diet, which can help decrease the build-up of toxic metabolites.

### Drug Response

Currently, there are no drugs that specifically target the MCCC1 gene. However, individuals with mutations in this gene may benefit from enzyme replacement therapy or other treatments that address the underlying cause of their disease.
