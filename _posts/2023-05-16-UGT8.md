## Information about gene UGT8

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

**Gene:** UGT8

**Genetic location:** Chromosome 4q14

**Aliases:** UDP glycosyltransferase 8, Galbeta1-3GalNAc synthase, GALGT, GALT-I, UGT8A

**Function:** The UGT8 gene encodes an enzyme called UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of galactolipids in myelin. 

### External IDs and sites

### Related Disease

Mutations in UGT8 gene have been associated with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 4H (CMT4H). 

### Treatment and prognosis

There is no cure for CMT4H yet, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms. Physical therapy and assistive devices such as braces or orthopedic surgery to improve mobility may be helpful.

### Drug response

There are no drugs known to specifically target UGT8 gene at the moment.
