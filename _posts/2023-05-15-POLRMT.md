# Information about gene POLRMT

## Genetic Position and Pathology

The POLRMT gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 16 in humans. This gene encodes for the RNA polymerase mitochondrial  (POLRMT) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of mitochondrial genes. Mutations in this gene are associated with mitochondrial diseases such as mitochondrial myopathy and Leigh syndrome.

## Function

The POLRMT gene encodes for a protein that functions as the mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is responsible for the transcription of mitochondrial genes, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation. 

## External IDs and aliases

External IDs for POLRMT gene include:

- HGNC: 9120
- NCBI Entrez: 54477
- Ensembl: ENSG00000102751
- OMIM: 604983
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5S2

Aliases for POLRMT gene include:

- MTRNR2L3 
- mtRNA polymerase
- POLRMT1 
- RPOLMT

| p.Thr1583Ala | Missense | rs763727309 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs and InDels that have been identified in the POLRMT gene. Some examples of these mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are listed below:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.46G>A | Missense | rs143074517 |
| c.1313G>A | Missense | rs200714128 |
| c.2408T>C | Missense | rs776251474 |
| c.2729G>A | Missense | rs1562843841 |
| c.3257A>C | Missense | rs1562843803 |

## Related diseases

Mutations in the POLRMT gene are associated with several mitochondrial diseases. Some examples of these diseases are:

- Mitochondrial myopathy
- Leigh syndrome
- Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the POLRMT gene. Treatment usually involves managing symptoms and addressing complications that arise from the disease. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug response

There is currently no drug that specifically targets POLRMT gene mutations. However, some drugs have been used to manage symptoms of mitochondrial diseases caused by POLRMT gene mutations. For example, coenzyme Q10 has been shown to improve muscle weakness in some patients with mitochondrial myopathy.
