# Information about Gene AIRE

## Genetic Position
The AIRE gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 at position 21q22.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the AIRE gene have been associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the development of multiple endocrine tissue failures.

## Function
The AIRE gene encodes for a transcriptional regulator that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of immune cells, particularly T-lymphocytes. Specifically, AIRE is involved in the induction of central tolerance by promoting the expression of tissue-specific antigens within the thymus. This process is necessary for the elimination of autoreactive T cells that could potentially lead to autoimmune disease.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations of the AIRE gene have been reported in the literature.

## Related Disease
The AIRE gene is associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). APS-1 is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple endocrine organs and is characterized by autoimmunity targeting self-antigens.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for APS-1, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms associated with endocrine dysfunction. Prognosis is highly variable depending on the severity and combination of affected endocrine organs.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeted towards the AIRE gene or APS-1.
