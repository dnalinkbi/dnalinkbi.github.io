## Gene B3GAT2

### Information
**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 13q12.3  
**Pathologies:** Multiple Joint Dislocations with Short Stature (MJDS), osteoarthritis  
**Function:** Encodes beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 2, which is involved in the synthesis of proteoglycans and extracellular matrix components  
**Aliases:** B3GAT2, GlcAT-I, Beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 2

### Related Diseases
- Multiple Joint Dislocations with Short Stature (MJDS)  
- Osteoarthritis  

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure or specific treatment for MJDS. Treatment options for osteoarthritis focus on pain management and physical therapy, but there is no cure for the disease itself.  
The prognosis for individuals with MJDS depends on the severity of their symptoms and any associated complications. Osteoarthritis typically progresses slowly, and the prognosis for individuals with the condition varies.  

### Drug Response
Currently, there is no known drug that targets B3GAT2 specifically for the treatment of MJDS or osteoarthritis.
