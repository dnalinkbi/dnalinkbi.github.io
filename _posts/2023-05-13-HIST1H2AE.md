# Information on Gene HIST1H2AE

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Gene:** HIST1H2AE

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 6 p22.1

**Aliases:** H2A1H, H2A/a, H2AFA, H2AFJ, H2AFL, H2AFY

**Function:** The HIST1H2AE gene encodes a member of the histone H2A family of proteins, which are essential components of nucleosomes that package DNA into chromatin structure. The encoded protein is involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 4741
- NCBI Entrez: 3016
- Ensembl: ENSG00000244734
- OMIM: 601464
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P0C0S5

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

No non-synonymous mutations have been reported for the HIST1H2AE gene.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic mutations have been reported for the HIST1H2AE gene.

**Related Disease:**

No diseases have been directly associated with mutations or alterations in the HIST1H2AE gene.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

As HIST1H2AE gene commonly occurs as a somatic member of a fusion gene in pediatric tumors, the prognosis and treatment options are highly variable and dependent on the specific type of tumor.

**Drug Response:**

No drugs have been reported to specifically target the HIST1H2AE gene.
