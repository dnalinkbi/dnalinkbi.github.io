# Information about Gene TBX3

## Genetic Position
TBX3 is a gene located on chromosome 12q24.21.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TBX3 gene have been found to be associated with ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of the ulna and mammary gland development.

## Function
TBX3 encodes for a transcription factor that plays a role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the mammary gland and limb buds.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of UMS is symptomatic and may include orthopedic or plastic surgery. The prognosis for individuals with UMS is usually good, with most individuals living a normal lifespan.

## Drug Response
Unknown
