## Gene ETFB
ETFB is a gene located on chromosome 19q13.2 that encodes electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta. This gene is also known as ETF-beta, EFTB, MADD, and MEDAPS. The protein coded by ETFB plays a vital role in the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, which is responsible for the metabolism of fatty acids. 

### Function
The primary function of ETFB is to transfer electrons from fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase and other flavoproteins to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. ETFB is a subunit of the ETF or electron transfer flavoprotein complex, which functions as a "mobile electron carrier" in the mitochondrial matrix. It is a crucial enzyme that maintains homeostasis in lipid metabolism.

### Related Disease
Mutations in ETFB are associated with a rare metabolic disorder called multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as ethylmalonic-adipic aciduria. MADD is a potentially life-threatening disorder characterized by a broad range of symptoms, including developmental delay, muscle weakness, hypotonia, seizures, and various metabolic abnormalities. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for MADD. However, proper management of the disorder can be achieved through a combination of dietary modification, vitamin and mineral supplements, and pharmacological intervention. In general, the prognosis of patients with MADD is variable and depends on the severity of the disease. Some individuals may show rapid progression of symptoms, while others may experience a more gradual decline in function.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available regarding the drug response and pharmacogenomics of ETFB. However, some studies have suggested that carnitine supplementation may be beneficial in managing some of the symptoms of MADD.
