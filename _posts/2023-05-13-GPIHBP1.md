# Information about GPIHBP1 gene

## Genetic Position
- The GPIHBP1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24.3).

## Pathology
- Mutations in the GPIHBP1 gene have been linked to familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and hypertriglyceridemia.
- FCS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by high levels of triglycerides in the blood, leading to episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis, eruptive xanthomas, and lipemia retinalis.

## Function
- The GPIHBP1 gene encodes a protein of the same name (GPIHBP1) that is primarily expressed in capillary endothelial cells.
- GPIHBP1 is responsible for binding lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the capillary lumen, which is required for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoprotein particles.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not applicable (GPIHBP1 mutations are inherited germline mutations)

## Related Disease
- Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS)
- Hypertriglyceridemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- FCS is typically treated with diet modification, weight loss, and medication to lower triglyceride levels.
- Prognosis for FCS is generally good with proper management of symptoms.
- Hypertriglyceridemia can also be managed with lifestyle changes and medications.

## Drug Response
- A study found that patients with certain GPIHBP1 mutations responded well to a high-fat diet, potentially due to increased transport of chylomicron remnants from the liver to peripheral tissues.
