# Information about Gene CD86

## Genetic Position
The CD86 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 3q13.3.

## Pathology
The CD86 gene is associated with various pathologies, including autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer.

## Function
The CD86 gene encodes a protein called B7-2 (also known as CD86). B7-2 is a cell surface receptor that interacts with T cells to regulate immune response. It is involved in the activation and differentiation of T cells and is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000114013
- OMIM: 601020
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P42081

The genomic location for CD86 is as follows: 
- Chromosome: 3
- Start position: 118,777,028 bp
- End position: 118,840,079 bp

Aliases for CD86 include:

## Related Disease 

The CD86 gene is associated with various diseases, including:
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Multiple sclerosis
- Infectious diseases
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment for diseases associated with CD86 may involve immunosuppressive drugs or biological therapies that target the immune system. The prognosis depends on the disease and its severity.

## Drug Response 
The response to drugs targeting CD86 may vary depending on the mutation type, disease state, and other factors.
