# **Gene Information Analysis for TRAF3IP2**

### **Genetic Position**

* **Gene Name:** TRAF3IP2
* **Chromosome Location:** Chromosome 6q21
* **Genetic Sequence:** NC_000006.12
* **Genomic Coordinates:** 99,700,677 - 99,756,273

### **Pathology and Function**

The TRAF3IP2 gene encodes Act1 protein that is important for the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses. Mutations in the TRAF3IP2 gene are associated with susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and lupus erythematosus.
