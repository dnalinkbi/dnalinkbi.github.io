## Gene CXCL5
- **Function:** CXCL5 encodes a protein called ENA-78, which belongs to the CXC chemokine family. ENA-78 functions as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and plays a role in inflammatory responses. It has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases.
- **External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC: 4605
    - NCBI Entrez: 6375
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000163739
    - OMIM: 148030
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P42830
    - Genomic Location: 4q13.3
    - Aliases: ENA78, SCYB5
    
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - No significant somatic mutations in CXCL5 have been reported in the literature.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No significant somatic SNVs/InDels in CXCL5 have been reported in the literature.

- **Related Diseases:** 
    - As mentioned earlier, CXCL5 has been implicated in several diseases, including:
        - Cancer: CXCL5 promotes tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. It also plays a role in tumor angiogenesis.
        - Rheumatoid arthritis: CXCL5 is overexpressed in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and is thought to contribute to disease progression.
        - Cardiovascular diseases: CXCL5 has been implicated in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - Due to its involvement in several diseases, CXCL5 is a potential target for therapy. However, no drugs targeting CXCL5 are currently approved for clinical use. 
    - The prognosis of CXCL5-related diseases varies depending on the specific disease and its stage.

- **Drug Response:**
    - One study showed that neutralization of CXCL5 with a monoclonal antibody blocked tumor growth in a lung cancer mouse model. However, further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CXCL5-targeted therapies in humans.
