# Gene: PANK2

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chr. 20, q13.33
- **Pathology:** Mutation in PANK2 gene is associated with PKAN (Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder which leads to progressive dystonia, parkinsonism, dysarthria, spasticity, and cognitive decline.
- **Function for gene:** PANK2 is a member of the pantothenate kinase family and is involved in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. It catalyzes the first step of CoA biosynthesis, which is the phosphorylation of pantothenate (vitamin B5). 
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location:** 
    - HGNC: 8778
    - NCBI Entrez: 80025
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000125870
    - OMIM: 606157
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BZ23
    - Genomic location: NC_000020.10 (30934964..30964374)
    - Aliases: Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, NBIA1, PKAN, PKN

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list:** A list of PANK2 AA mutations associated with PKAN is available at [PMID: 20818664] (Table 4). The mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift and splice site mutations.
- **Mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - Missense mutations: rs141183081, rs146257364, rs758966972, rs761645073, rs797044174
    - Nonsense mutations: rs1378535875, rs753064447, rs1455994465, rs782184709, rs797044173
    - Frameshift mutations: rs1378535875, rs753064447, rs1455994465, rs782184709, rs797044173
    - Splice site mutations: rs1378535875, rs753064447, rs1455994465, rs782184709, rs797044173
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There is no information available about somatic mutations in PANK2 gene.
 
## Related Disease
- **Related Disease:** PKAN (Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration) is the related disease associated with mutations in the PANK2 gene.
- ** Treatment and prognosis:** There is no definitive cure or treatment for PKAN till date. Current available treatments focus on symptomatic relief and palliative care. The disease progression is unpredictable and the prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.
- **Drug response:** There is no approved drug or therapy for PKAN. However, certain drugs such as iron chelation therapy, levodopa, and deep brain stimulation have been used in the management of symptoms.
