## Gene: GLA

### Genomic location
GLA is located at chromosome Xq22.1.

### Function
GLA encodes alpha-galactosidase A, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of glycosphingolipids.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 4299
- NCBI Entrez: 2717
- Ensembl: ENSG00000102393
- OMIM: 300644
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P06280

Aliases: AGAL, GLA1, GLA2, GLA3

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala143Thr - missense mutation - rs104894104
- p.Asp313His - missense mutation - rs104894105
- p.Asp322Gly - missense mutation - rs104894106
- p.Arg118Cys - missense mutation - rs104894107
- p.Arg118Leu - missense mutation - rs104894108
- p.Ser126Gly - missense mutation - rs104894109

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in GLA.

### Related disease
Deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A due to mutations in GLA is associated with Fabry disease, a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder.

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options include enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy. Without treatment, patients with Fabry disease may develop end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and/or stroke.

### Drug response
The efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy may vary among patients with Fabry disease.
