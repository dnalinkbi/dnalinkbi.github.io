## Information about Gene MT-ND4L

### Genetic position, Pathology, and Function

Gene MT-ND4L is a mitochondrial gene that encodes for NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 4L. It is located on the mitochondrial genome at position 10,894-11,228. Mutations in this gene have been associated with mitochondrial diseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and mitochondriopathy.

The function of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 4L is to perform an essential role in cellular respiration, specifically in the electron transport chain. This protein helps to transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is necessary for the production of ATP.
