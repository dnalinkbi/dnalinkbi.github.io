# Information about Gene FOXP3

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic position**: FOXP3 gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.23.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the FOXP3 gene are associated with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome.
- **Function**: FOXP3 is a transcriptional regulator that plays a crucial role in the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). It controls the expression of genes that are involved in the suppressive function of Tregs.

## Other Information
- **Function for gene**: Transcriptional regulator that controls the suppressive function of Tregs.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
   - p.Lys250_Glu251insSer (insertion mutation) with dbSNP ID rs146254421
   - p.Ala377Thr (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs267606829
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported in dbSNP.
- **Related disease**: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome.
- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is currently no cure for IPEX syndrome. Treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms with immunosuppressive drugs and bone marrow transplantation in severe cases.
- **Drug response**: There are no specific drugs that are approved for the treatment of IPEX syndrome, but immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are often used.
