# Genetic Information Analysis Report: Gene DLL3

## Gene Information

* **Function for gene**: The DLL3 (Delta-like 3) gene codes for a protein involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis.

* **External IDs for gene**: HGNC: 2861, NCBI Entrez: 28514, Ensembl: ENSG00000187634, OMIM: 602768, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NYJ7

* **Aliases**: SCDLP, DL3, SCDO1, HDHR1, RVIG5

## Variant Information

* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Currently, there are no known amino acid (AA) mutations or functional polymorphisms reported for the DLL3 gene in dbSNP.

* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are various somatic mutations reported in the DLL3 gene in different types of cancer. These include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. Some of the reported dbSNP IDs are rs797045382, rs797046980, and rs797045383.

## Pathology and Related Disease

* **Related Disease**: Mutations in the DLL3 gene have been associated with various developmental disorders such as *spondylocostal dysostosis*, which affects the development of the spine and ribs.

* DLL3 gene expression has been found to be altered in several types of cancers such as small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

* **Treatment**: Currently, there is no targeted therapy available for DLL3 gene mutations, but research is underway to evaluate DLL3 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

* **Prognosis**: The prognosis largely depends on the specific disease associated with DLL3 mutations or gene expression alterations. In some cases, such as small cell lung cancer, high DLL3 expression is associated with a poor prognosis.

## Drug Response

* There are currently no drugs approved by the FDA that target the DLL3 gene. However, there are clinical trials investigating the use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting DLL3 in small cell lung carcinoma.
