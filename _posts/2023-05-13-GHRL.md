# GHRL Gene

## Information about GHRL Gene

GHRL gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 9 at position 13.3. It encodes a 28-amino acid peptide hormone called ghrelin, which is mainly produced by the stomach.

## Function of GHRL Gene

Ghrelin plays roles in regulating appetite, hunger, and food intake. It also regulates glucose metabolism and influences the release of growth hormone in the pituitary gland.

- OMIM: 605353
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UBU3

## AA Mutation and Mutation Type for GHRL Gene

There are several variations in the GHRL gene that result in amino acid changes. Some common variants include:

- Leu72Met (rs696217)
- Arg51Gln (rs27647)
- Ser18Cys (rs34911341)

These variants are reported in the dbSNP database as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels for GHRL Gene

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the GHRL gene.

## Related Disease

GHRL gene variants have been associated with various metabolic disorders, including:

- Obesity
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Cardiovascular Diseases

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for GHRL gene mutations. However, lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise modifications, may improve symptoms associated with metabolic disorders.

## Drug Response

There is no information currently available about drug responses specific to GHRL gene mutations.
