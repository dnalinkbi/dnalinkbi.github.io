# Gene ECE1

## Genomic Location, Aliases and ID's
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1, NC_000001.11 (38393405..38427813), - strand
- Gene ID: 1889
- HGNC ID: 3181
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000116291
- Aliases: Endothelin-converting enzyme 1, ECE-1

## Function for gene
The ECE1 gene encodes endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1) which is a type II integral membrane protein that is expressed in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. It is involved in the generation of active endothelin peptides from the precursor big endothelin, which play a role in blood pressure regulation, vascular tone and remodeling, and cell proliferation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known missense mutations in the ECE1 gene:
- R92W (rs149617532): This variant results in an arginine to tryptophan substitution at amino acid position 92.
- I242V (rs116409791): This variant results in an isoleucine to valine substitution at amino acid position 242.
- G103T (rs387907202): This variant results in a glycine to threonine substitution at amino acid position 103.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are various somatic mutations in the ECE1 gene that have been implicated in different types of cancer, such as lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma. Some examples of somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID are:
- c.1010-19A>G (rs770448393): This variant is a splice site mutation that has been reported in lung adenocarcinoma.
- c.1431G>A (rs372555531): This variant results in a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid position 477 and has been reported in ovarian cancer.
- c.891+1G>A (rs111365581): This variant is a splice site mutation that has been reported in glioblastoma.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the ECE1 gene have been associated with various diseases, such as hypertension, preeclampsia, and cancer. In particular, overexpression of ECE-1 has been observed in different types of cancer and may be a potential target for cancer therapy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no targeted therapy for ECE1 mutations or overexpression in cancer. However, inhibitors of the endothelin pathway, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, have been used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.

## Drug Response
The endothelin receptor antagonists bosentan and ambrisentan have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These drugs block the binding of endothelin peptides to their receptors, thereby reducing vasoconstriction and cell proliferation.
