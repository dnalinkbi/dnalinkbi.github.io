# Information about Gene UGCG

## Genetic Position

The UGCG gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q31.1) [1].

## Pathology

Mutations in the UGCG gene have been associated with various diseases, including Parkinson's disease [2], Alzheimer's disease [3], and breast cancer [4]. Abnormalities in UGCG expression have also been linked to insulin resistance [5], atherosclerosis [6], and inflammation [7].

## Function

The UGCG gene encodes the UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide. This process is important for the synthesis of sphingolipids, which play a role in cellular signaling pathways and membrane structure [8].
