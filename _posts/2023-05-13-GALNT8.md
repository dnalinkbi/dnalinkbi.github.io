# Gene GALNT8 

## Information 

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 12, 22,807,070 - 22,814,561 
- **Pathology:** The gene GALNT8 mutations have not been directly linked with any specific disease or syndrome, but have been implicated in various cancers. 
- **Function:** GALNT8 encodes a protein that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. This process, called O-glycosylation, plays a crucial role in cell signaling, differentiation, and immune function. 

## External IDs 

- **Gene ID:** 11359 
- **Genomic location:** NC_000012.12 
- **Aliases:** GALNAC-T8, GalNAc-T8, KIAA1128, ppGalNAcT10
