# Information About Gene CCDC39

## Genetic Position
The CCDC39 gene, also known as Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 39, is located on the long arm of chromosome 3. Specifically, it is found at the position 3q26.33.

## Pathology and Function
The CCDC39 gene plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures found on the surface of cells throughout the body. Cilia have a variety of functions, such as helping to move mucus and other substances out of the lungs and sinuses. Mutations in the CCDC39 gene can lead to a rare genetic disorder called primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is characterized by respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis, and other respiratory problems due to impaired ciliary function.

* HGNC ID: HGNC:25792
* NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 54920
* Ensembl ID: ENSG00000179218
* OMIM ID: 613798
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9UPG4
* Aliases: CCDC39, FLJ20255

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several mutations have been identified in the CCDC39 gene that cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. These include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations. A few examples of CCDC39 mutations from the dbSNP database are:
* p.Arg195Leu (rs587776891)
* p.Lys232Glu (rs1057519116)
* p.Ile98fs (rs1057519140)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in the CCDC39 gene have not been extensively studied, and there is no evidence that they play a role in cancer or other diseases.

## Related Disease
As mentioned earlier, mutations in the CCDC39 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia. This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the function of cilia throughout the body, leading to respiratory problems and other symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms with antibiotics, airway clearance techniques, and other supportive therapies. The prognosis for PCD varies depending on the severity of the disease and the extent of organ involvement.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug therapy for primary ciliary dyskinesia, although antibiotics and other medications may be used to manage specific symptoms.
