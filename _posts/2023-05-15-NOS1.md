# Gene Information for NOS1

### Gene Function
The NOS1 gene encodes for the neuronal nitric oxide synthase enzyme, which produces nitric oxide in the nervous system. Nitric oxide has several physiological functions, including neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and blood flow regulation.
