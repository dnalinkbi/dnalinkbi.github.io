## Gene Information for RANGRF

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- RANGRF is located on Chromosome 17 at the position: 17q25.3.
- Mutations in RANGRF are not currently known to cause any genetic diseases.

### Function
- RANGRF encodes for a protein that belongs to the family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs).
- The protein product of RANGRF facilitates the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on the small GTPase protein, RAN.
- This function regulates important cellular processes such as nuclear transport, spindle assembly during mitosis, and apoptosis.
