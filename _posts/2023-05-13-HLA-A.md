## Gene HLA-A

- **Function for gene:** HLA-A gene encodes a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC Class I) molecule which presents antigenic peptides to T cells. It plays an important role in the immune response by presenting foreign antigens to cytotoxic T cells.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 3105
    - Genomic location: 6p21.3
    - Aliases: HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A-2 alpha chain, MHC class I antigen A*2, HLA-A2.1, MHC class I antigen alpha chain A, HLAA

- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: 4933
    - NCBI Entrez: 3105
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000206503
    - OMIM: 142800
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04439

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
   - rs1043820: C>G (p.Pro250Arg)
   - rs2894207: A>C (p.Arg62Gly)
   - rs9268853: A>C (p.Arg240Gly)
   - rs2071478: C>T (p.Arg178Trp)
   - rs8177412: A>C (p.Tyr103Ser)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No somatic SNVs/InDels available as the HLA genes are highly polymorphic and can vary across individuals.

- **Related disease:**
    - HLA-A gene is associated with a number of different diseases such as:
        - Autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.
        - Infectious diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, etc.
        - Cancer - HLA-A molecules are involved in immune recognition and elimination of cancer cells.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**
    - In some cases, HLA-A typing is important for determining the best treatment option for individuals with certain diseases. For example, in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, HLA-A matching between the donor and the patient is crucial for the success of the transplant. Prognosis varies greatly depending on the specific disease associated with HLA-A.

- **Drug response:**
    - Certain drugs have been found to be more effective in individuals with specific HLA-A alleles. For example, the drug abacavir, used to treat HIV, is associated with hypersensitivity reactions in patients with the HLA-A*57:01 allele. Therefore, HLA-A typing is important before prescribing such drugs.
