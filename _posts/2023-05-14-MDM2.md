# Gene: MDM2 

## Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12q15

## Pathology:
- MDM2 amplification and overexpression have been associated with various cancers, such as sarcomas, breast cancer, and lung cancer.

## Function:
- MDM2 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, preventing its activation and promoting its degradation. It also has p53-independent activities in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 6973
- NCBI Entrez: 4193 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135679
- OMIM: 164785
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q00987
- Aliases: HDMX, MDMX

- p.Thr309Thr (rs2279744)
- p.Ser395Arg (rs11540654)
- Mutation types: missense, synonymous

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.376G>T (rs121912668)
- c.-5C>G (rs587782852)
- c.710G>A (rs121912669)
- c.1094G>A (rs121912670)

## Related Disease:
- Cancer, specifically sarcoma, glioma, breast cancer, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Several MDM2 inhibitors, such as Nutlin-3, RG7388, and AM-8553, have been developed and tested in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.

## Drug Response:
- Nutlin-3 has shown promising results in the treatment of various cancers, particularly in combination with other drugs. RG7388 has also been shown to be effective in clinical trials.
