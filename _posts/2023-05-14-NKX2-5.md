## Gene Information

Gene: NKX2-5

Location: Chromosome 5q34

Aliases: CSX, CSX1, Homeobox protein CSX, Homeobox protein NK-2 homolog E, NKX2E

## Function

The NKX2-5 gene encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor that is essential for heart development. Specifically, it plays a key role in the formation of the cardiac chambers and the conduction system. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various congenital heart defects, such as atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and Tetralogy of Fallot.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for NKX2-5-related heart defects may include surgical procedures such as repair of the septal defects or insertion of a pacemaker for conduction abnormalities. The prognosis for individuals with NKX2-5 mutations varies depending on the specific defect and severity.

## Drug Response

There have been no specific drugs identified that target NKX2-5 mutations.
