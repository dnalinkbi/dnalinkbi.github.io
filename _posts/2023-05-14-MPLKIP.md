## Information about gene MPLKIP

### Genetic Position

The MPLKIP gene is located on chromosome 8: 30,727,017 - 30,732,320 (GRCh38/hg38).

### Pathology

MPLKIP is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation of cancer cells. The overexpression of MPLKIP has been observed in various types of cancer, including gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and gliomas.

### Function for Gene

The MPLKIP gene encodes for a protein called "M-phase phosphoprotein 8-interacting protein" (MPP8IP). This protein plays an essential role in regulating the progression of the cell cycle from G2 to mitosis. Additionally, it binds to MPP8, a chromatin-binding protein, forming a complex involved in histone modification and transcriptional regulation.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several documented amino acid changes in MPLKIP, including:

- Val350Gly (rs146902472)
- Phe398Leu (rs148430685)
- Leu402Pro (rs144426067)
- Val463Ala (rs149629864)

All of these mutations are missense mutations, meaning that they cause a change in the amino acid sequence of the MPP8IP protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several documented somatic mutations in the MPLKIP gene associated with various types of cancer. These include:

- c.818T>C (p.Leu273Pro) (rs587782973)
- c.1499A>C (p.Ile500Leu) (rs774931896)
- c.542G>A (p.Gly181Ser) (rs140116289)

### Related Disease

MPLKIP is implicated in several types of cancer, including gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and gliomas. The overexpression of MPLKIP has been associated with increased proliferation and survival of cancer cells.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There are currently no treatments specifically targeting MPLKIP, but ongoing research is investigating the use of inhibitors of histone deacetylases, which are involved in the regulation of MPLKIP and the MPP8IP complex. The prognosis for patients with MPLKIP overexpression varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.

### Drug Response

There is currently no specific drug response associated with the MPLKIP gene.
