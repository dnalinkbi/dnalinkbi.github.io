# Information about Gene PROKR2

## Genetic Position
PROKR2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 at position 13.2 (20q13.2). It spans nearly 17 kilobases and contains two exons.

## Pathology
Pathogenic mutations in the PROKR2 gene are associated with Kallmann syndrome (KS), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence or delayed puberty due to the failure of the hypothalamic GnRH neurons to migrate to the olfactory placode during embryonic development.

## Function
PROKR2 encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to two endogenous ligands, prokineticin 2 (PK2) and prokineticin 1 (PK1), which are involved in various physiological processes such as regulation of circadian rhythm, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation.

## AA Mutation List
Some of the reported missense mutations in the PROKR2 gene that are associated with Kallmann syndrome include:
- R85C (dbSNP ID: rs121909696)
- R85H (dbSNP ID: rs121909695)
- G183S (dbSNP ID: rs121909693)
- L173R (dbSNP ID: rs121909694)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are no reported somatic variants in the PROKR2 gene in the COSMIC database.

## Related disease
- Kallmann syndrome (OMIM ID: 308700)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for Kallmann syndrome, but hormone therapy can be effective in inducing puberty and restoring fertility. Several studies have shown that early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis and prevent the complications associated with the disorder.

## Drug response
There is limited information on the drug response of Kallmann syndrome patients with PROKR2 mutations, but some studies have suggested that prokineticin receptor antagonists or agonists may be potential therapeutic options for the disorder.
