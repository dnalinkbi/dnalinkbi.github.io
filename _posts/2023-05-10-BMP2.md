# BMP2 Gene

The BMP2 gene is located on chromosome 20q13.31 and encodes Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2. This gene is also known by various names such as BMP2A, BMP2B, BDA2, and BMP2K.

## Function for gene

The protein product of the BMP2 gene is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²) superfamily. BMP2 is involved in multiple processes such as bone and cartilage development, embryonic patterning, and tissue repair. This protein promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, which are cells responsible for bone formation and regeneration.

- NM_001200.3:c.929G>A (p.Arg310Gln) - rs28934579

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in the BMP2 gene are associated with various types of cancers such as breast, liver, and lung cancer. Some of these mutations are:

- NM_001200.3:c.755G>A (p.Val252Ile) - rs369777466
- NM_001200.3:c.992C>T (p.Thr331Ile) - rs876657183

## Related Disease

Mutations in the BMP2 gene are associated with a variety of disorders including bone diseases, craniofacial abnormalities, and cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis

Several studies have shown the potential of BMP2 as a therapeutic agent for bone regeneration. BMP2 is already used clinically for spinal fusion, bone fractures, and non-union bone defects. However, the risks of BMP2 use have been reported such as bone overgrowth, inflammation, and increased cancer risk.

## Drug response

Studies have shown that BMP2 expression can be influenced by various drugs such as statins, retinoic acid, and estrogen. These findings indicate that modulation of BMP2 can be used as a therapeutic strategy for various diseases.
