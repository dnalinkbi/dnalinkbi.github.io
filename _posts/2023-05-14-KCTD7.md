# Information about Gene KCTD7

### Genetic Position
KCTD7 gene is located on chromosome 7q21.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in KCTD7 gene have been associated with intellectual disability and cerebellar atrophy.

### Function
KCTD7 encodes a protein that belongs to the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) family. The protein is involved in regulating ion channel activity and is known to interact with several potassium channels.
