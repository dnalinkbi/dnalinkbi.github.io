# Information about Gene SIPA1L1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** The SIPA1L1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.1).
- **Pathology:** Certain variations or mutations in the SIPA1L1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
- **Function:** The SIPA1L1 gene encodes a protein that regulates cell signaling pathways, including those involved in cell growth and division.
