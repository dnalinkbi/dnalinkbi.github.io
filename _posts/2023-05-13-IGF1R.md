# Information about Gene IGF1R

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location

The IGF1R gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at the position 15q26.3.

## Pathology and Function

The IGF1R gene encodes insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, which is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. This receptor plays a critical role in various biological processes such as cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Studies have shown that altered IGF1R expression and signaling is associated with several malignancies including breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancer.
