## Information about gene RAD21L1

### Genetic position
The RAD21L1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 11.21.

### Pathology and function
The RAD21L1 gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAD21 subfamily of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) protein family. The protein plays a critical role in sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis, which is necessary for proper chromosomal segregation and gamete formation. Mutations in this gene have been associated with male infertility.

### Function
The function of the RAD21L1 gene is to encode for a protein that is essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiotic cell division. The protein ensures that sister chromatids remain attached until it is time for them to separate so that each daughter cell receives a complete and accurate set of chromosomes.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known AA (amino acid) mutations in the RAD21L1 gene, including:
- R353H (dbSNP ID: rs142934826)
- R352C (dbSNP ID: rs142289783)
- I304T (dbSNP ID: rs142066744)
- A377S (dbSNP ID: rs150744563)

All of these mutations are missense mutations, meaning they change one amino acid in the protein sequence.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for the RAD21L1 gene.

### Related disease
Mutations in the RAD21L1 gene have been associated with male infertility, specifically the inability to produce viable spermatozoa.

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for male infertility caused by mutations in the RAD21L1 gene. However, there are several treatment options available, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE). The prognosis for individuals with mutations in this gene depends on the severity of the mutation and the success of the chosen treatment.

### Drug response
There is currently no known drug response for mutations in the RAD21L1 gene.
