# Analysis of Gene FUT8

## Gene Information
- Gene Name: FUT8
- Function: FUT8 encodes an enzyme called fucosyltransferase 8 that catalyzes the transfer of a fucose sugar molecule to other molecules. This enzyme is involved in the glycosylation of proteins and plays a role in cell adhesion and signaling.
- External IDs: HGNC:3970, NCBI Entrez Gene: 2539, Ensembl: ENSG00000137868, OMIM: 104230, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BYC5
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 14q23.3

## Mutations and Variations
- AA mutation list: A number of mutations have been described in FUT8 including R162Q, E234K, and R479W.
- Mutation Type: Missense mutations
- dbSNP ID: rs142617563, rs267607143, rs62496338

## Related Diseases
- FUT8 has been associated with a number of diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG).

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with FUT8 mutations depend on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation. In some cases, treatment may involve medications to manage symptoms or therapies to address underlying disease processes.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information regarding the drug response of FUT8 mutations.
