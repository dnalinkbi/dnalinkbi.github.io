# Gene DEF6

## Genetic Position
The gene DEF6 is located on Chromosome 6 (6q21) at the position 130,379,721-130,392,068.

## Pathology
DEF6 has been found to play a role in various diseases such as cancer, immune disorders, and infectious diseases.

## Function
DEF6 encodes for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which regulates the activity of Rho family GTPases. DEF6 acts as a regulator of T-cell activation, proliferation and differentiation.
