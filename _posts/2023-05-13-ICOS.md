# Gene: ICOS

## Genetic Position 
ICOS (Inducible T cell COStimulator) gene is located on the Chromosome Xq13.1.

## Pathology
ICOS gene mutations are rare and not significant for disease development. But, in some cases, a high level of ICOS expression has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders. 

## Function
ICOS is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the CD28 family of costimulatory molecules. It is expressed on activated T cells and interact with B7-H2 on antigen-activated B cells and dendritic cells. This interaction plays a vital role in enhancing T cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production. Hence, ICOS is crucial for the regulation of the immune system.

## AA Mutation and dbSNP ID
There are few AA mutations reported in the ICOS gene with their corresponding dbSNP ID. Some of them are:
- p.Asp179Glu (rs41509742)
- p.Asn107Ser (rs36094234)
- p.Val12Ile (rs61744847)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID
Few somatic SNVs/InDels with their dbSNP ID:
- c.223C>T (rs146647878)
- c.187G>A (rs775723502)
- c.77G>A (rs150713139)

## Related Diseases
ICOS gene mutations are not commonly associated with diseases. However, studies have shown that ICOS expression is associated with various autoimmune disorders, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular diseases.

## Treatment and Prognosis 
There is no specific treatment available for ICOS gene mutations. Nevertheless, research is ongoing for the development of therapies targeting the ICOS-B7-H2 pathway. Prognosis for patients with ICOS-related disorders vary depending on the disease condition.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs approved for ICOS gene mutations. However, studies have shown that ICOS blockade can suppress the immune response and inhibit autoimmune diseases.
