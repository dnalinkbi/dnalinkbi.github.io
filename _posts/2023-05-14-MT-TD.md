## Gene: MT-TD

- **Function for gene**: MT-TD encodes a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, which is responsible for the translation of the mitochondrial gene. Specifically, MT-TD encodes for the tRNA for aspartic acid. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: 
    - Gene ID: 4579
    - Genomic location: Chromosome MT: 12,159-12,226 (+ strand)
    - Other aliases: TRNAS1, MTASND, HSDMD, tRNA-Asp

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - There are several reported mutations in the MT-TD gene. Here are a few examples:
        - m.5560A>G: This mutation results in the replacement of a conserved methionine with a valine at position 11 (p.Met11Val) in the tRNA. This mutation has been associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.
        - m.5587T>C: This mutation has been associated with Leigh syndrome and results in the replacement of a tyrosine with a histidine at position 25 (p.Tyr25His) in the tRNA.
        - m.5589T>C: This mutation results in the replacement of a leucine with a proline at position 26 (p.Leu26Pro) in the tRNA. This mutation has been associated with mitochondrial myopathy.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the MT-TD gene.

- **Related disease**: Mutations in the MT-TD gene have been associated with a variety of mitochondrial diseases, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, and Leigh syndrome.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for mitochondrial diseases can involve management of symptoms and supportive care. There is currently no cure for mitochondrial diseases, and the prognosis can vary depending on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms.

- **Drug response**: There are currently no reported drug responses specific to mutations in the MT-TD gene.
