## CYP4V2 Gene Information

### Genetic Position

The CYP4V2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q35.1).

### Pathology and Function

The CYP4V2 gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is primarily expressed in tissues of the eye and is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. Mutations in the CYP4V2 gene have been associated with a number of genetic disorders, including Bietti crystalline dystrophy, a rare and progressive degenerative disease that affects the retina and causes vision loss.

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the CYP4V2 gene have been associated with the following diseases:

* Bietti Crystalline Dystrophy          
* Retinitis Pigmentosa

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for Bietti crystalline dystrophy. Treatment options are limited and focus on managing symptoms and preventing complications.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug that targets the specific mutation in the CYP4V2 gene. However, symptomatic treatment and the use of antioxidants may help to slow the progression of the disease.
