# Gene GPS1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: 17q11.2

## Pathology
There are no known pathological conditions associated with GPS1.

## Function
- GPS1 encodes for a protein called G protein pathway suppressor 1.
- It is involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling.
- GPS1 interacts with the G protein beta/gamma subunits and prevents their activation.
- This inhibition of G protein activity ultimately leads to the decreased signaling through GPCRs.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 4575
- NCBI Entrez ID: 2876
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000167988
- OMIM ID: 606786
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9Y4I1
- Aliases: GPS1, GSP, CCDC54
