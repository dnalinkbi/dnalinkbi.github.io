## Gene: GSTM3

### Function:
GSTM3 (Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 3) belongs to the family of glutathione S-transferases, which are phase II detoxification enzymes. GSTM3 is involved in the metabolism of drugs, carcinogens, and other xenobiotics, catalyzing the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a variety of electrophilic and hydrophobic compounds.

### Related Diseases:
GST polymorphisms like GSTM3 have been associated with several diseases, including cancers (lung, bladder, colorectal, prostate), Alzheimer's disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The association between GSTM3 and diseases like cancer suggests that targeting GSTM3 can be a potential therapeutic strategy. Several studies have investigated the GSTM3 genotype as a potential marker for predicting the response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and drug treatment. However, the effectiveness of these therapies may depend on the individual's GSTM3 genotype.

### Drug Response:
Polymorphisms in GSTM3 gene may affect drug metabolism, leading to altered drug efficacy or toxicity. For example, GSTM3 null genotype has been shown to increase the risk of drug-induced liver injury.
