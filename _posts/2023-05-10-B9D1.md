### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels associated with B9D1 gene.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the B9D1 gene have been linked to a condition called Joubert syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an underdeveloped brainstem and cerebellum. This can lead to various symptoms including difficulty with balance and coordination, breathing problems, and cognitive impairment.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no known cure for Joubert syndrome. Treatment is typically symptomatic and may involve physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, and respiratory support.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the B9D1 gene.
