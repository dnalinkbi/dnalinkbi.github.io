## Gene B3GAT1

### Genetic Position
Gene B3GAT1 is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q12.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the B3GAT1 gene have been associated with progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a rare genetic disorder that affects the connective tissues in the body.

### Function
B3GAT1 encodes a beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase that is involved in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are structural components of the extracellular matrix that provide support to tissues and organs.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID reported for B3GAT1.

### Related Disease
Progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) has been associated with mutations in the B3GAT1 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for EDS, and treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. Prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug available for the treatment of EDS caused by B3GAT1 mutations.
