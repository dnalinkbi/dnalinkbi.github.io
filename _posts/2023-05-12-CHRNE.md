## Gene: CHRNE 

### Information 

#### Genetic Position

- Chr17:36956761-36964703

#### Function

- The CHRNE gene encodes acetylcholine receptor subunit epsilon, a subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction responsible for muscle contraction.

#### External IDs

- HGNC: 2018
- NCBI Entrez: 1144
- Ensembl: ENSG00000121114
- OMIM: 100725
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07510

#### Related Disease

- Myasthenic Syndrome, Congenital, 6, Presynaptic (OMIM: 254210)

#### Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment generally involves acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine to improve muscle function.
- The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the presence of other complications.

#### Drug Response

- Some patients may show improved muscle function with immunomodulatory agents like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).
