## Gene EBF1

### Genetic Position

Gene EBF1 is located on chromosome 5 at the 5q33.3 position.

### Pathology

Mutations in the EBF1 gene have been associated with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).

### Function

EBF1 encodes for a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of B-cells.

- c.925_926delGC (rs1057518642)

### Related Disease

Mutations in the EBF1 gene have been associated with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for B-ALL caused by EBF1 mutations. The prognosis for B-ALL patients with EBF1 mutations may depend on the specific mutation and other factors such as age and overall health.

### Drug Response

There is limited information available regarding drug response for patients with B-ALL caused by EBF1 mutations.
