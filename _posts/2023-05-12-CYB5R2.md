## Gene Information

**Gene**: CYB5R2

**Pathology**: CYB5R2 is associated with diseases such as Methemoglobinemia.

**Function**: CYB5R2 encodes for the cytochrome b5 reductase 2 enzyme which plays a role in the reduction of cytochrome b5.

**External IDs and Location**

- HGNC ID: 25493
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 57497
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000137599
- OMIM ID: 613218
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6P2C2
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11

**Aliases**: CDGSH2, GRIM-19, GRIM19

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**

There are several known amino acid mutations in CYB5R2 that have been associated with methemoglobinemia, including:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Arg246Cys | Missense | rs121434531 |
| Ser137Phe | Missense | rs768296548 |
| Asp284Asn | Missense | rs28931606 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported in CYB5R2.

**Related Disease**

Mutations in CYB5R2 have been associated with Methemoglobinemia, an inherited blood disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of methemoglobin in the blood.

**Treatment and Prognosis**

Treatment options for methemoglobinemia include methylene blue, oxygen therapy, and blood transfusions. The prognosis for individuals with methemoglobinemia is generally good with prompt treatment.

**Drug Response**

There is limited information available on drug response specific to CYB5R2 mutations.
