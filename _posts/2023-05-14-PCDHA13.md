## Gene: PCDHA13

### 1. Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 5
- Location: 5q31.2
- Strand: -

### 2. Pathology

PCDHA13 is associated with susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders and 
schizophrenia. 

### 3. Function for gene

PCDHA13 gene belongs to the protocadherin alpha gene cluster, a group of genes 
primarily expressed in the central nervous system. It encodes a member of the 
protocadherin alpha family, which is involved in neural development and 
neuronal connectivity.
