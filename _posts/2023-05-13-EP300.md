## Related Diseases

EP300 gene mutations have been associated with various diseases such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. EP300 mutations cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome type 2, which is characterized by distinct facial features, intellectual disability, and broad thumbs and first toes.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for EP300 related diseases. Treatment options for individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome include supportive care and management of symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with EP300 gene mutations depends on the specific condition and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is limited data on drug response specific to EP300 gene mutations at the moment.
