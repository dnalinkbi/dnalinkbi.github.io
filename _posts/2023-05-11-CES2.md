## Gene Information: CES2

### Pathology
- CES2 gene encodes a member of the carboxylesterase family of proteins that plays a role in drug metabolism.
- Variations in this gene may impact the function of the enzyme and subsequently impact individual drug responses.
- CES2 variants have been linked to drug toxicity and altered metabolic function.

### Function
- CES2 gene encodes a protein called Carboxylesterase 2.
- This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics by hydrolyzing ester and amide bonds.
- It is expressed in various organs including the liver, intestine, and kidney.

### External IDs and Location
- Gene ID: 8824
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 16:45,819,722-45,846,994
- Aliases: CES2A1, CES2A2, CES2A3, CES2A4, CES2A5, CES2A6, CES2A7, CES2A8, CES2B, CES2C, CES3, FLJ20414

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- CES2 variations have been linked with drug metabolism and toxicity.
- The CES2 variants with amino acid changes and their dbSNP IDs include:
    - rs71647871: Amino acid change = p.Gly143Glu
    - rs12033891: Amino acid change = p.Pro427Leu
    - rs34519209: Amino acid change = p.Thr49Ile

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations in the CES2 gene are not commonly reported in cancer or other diseases.

### Related Disease
- CES2 variants have been associated with drug toxicity, altered metabolic function, and disease susceptibility.
- Some of the diseases with CES2 gene variations as a contributing factor include:
    - Diabetic neuropathy
    - Epilepsy
    - Cancer
    - Digestive system diseases

### Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment of CES2-related disorders usually involves reducing drug dosage or selecting an alternative medication.
- Prognosis varies based on the specific disease and severity of CES2 variation.

### Drug Response
- CES2 variations affect the activity of the enzyme in the liver and other organs and may influence drug metabolism and response.
- Some of the drugs that are metabolized by CES2 include:
    - Anti-cancer drugs
    - Anti-inflammatory drugs
    - Anti-epileptics
