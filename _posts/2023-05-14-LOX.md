## Gene LOX

### Genetic Position
The LOX gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 at position 5q23.1.

### Pathology and Function
The LOX gene encodes for lysyl oxidase, an extracellular matrix enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of collagen fibers. This process is important in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix and the maintenance of tissue integrity. Mutations in LOX have been associated with conditions such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum and thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.

### Related Disease
- Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE)
- Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for PXE or TAAD. Treatment is focused on symptom management and surveillance for potential complications.

### Drug Response
There is limited research on drug response in individuals with mutations in LOX.
