### Treatment and Prognosis 
- **Treatment:** Currently, there are no effective treatments for globozoospermia. Assisted reproduction techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can be used to achieve pregnancy in couples affected by globozoospermia.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis for globozoospermia varies. Some couples may be able to achieve pregnancy through assisted reproductive techniques, while others may require sperm donation.

### Drug Response
