## Gene: ORC1

### Information:

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1:147,126,096-147,245,391
- **Pathology:** ORC1 mutations have been associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome 1 (MGS1) which is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by microtia, patellar aplasia/hypoplasia, and a proportionate short stature with intellectual disability.
- **Function:** The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC) which plays a key role in the initiation of DNA replication. ORC1 specifically binds to origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 8152
    - NCBI Entrez: 4999
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000083444
    - OMIM: 601902
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P54756
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Asp715Tyr (missense mutation) - rs137852964
    - p.Arg105Gln (missense mutation) - rs201926762
    - p.Gly733Ser (missense mutation) - rs137852965
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs79641652 - ORC1 p.Lys849Asn
    - rs79720126 - ORC1 p.Arg1054Cys
- **Related Disease:** Meier-Gorlin Syndrome 1 (MGS1)
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment is symptomatic and may include surgical interventions for certain birth defects or malformations. The prognosis is variable and depends on the severity of the phenotype.
- **Drug response:** No specific drug response information is available for ORC1 mutations at this time.
