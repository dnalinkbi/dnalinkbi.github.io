## Gene Information: RTN4R

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 22 (22q12.3)
- **Pathology:**-
- **Function:** RTN4R encodes for a protein called reticulon-4 receptor, which is involved in axon growth inhibition and neural plasticity.

- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 10425
    - NCBI Entrez: 65078
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000181019
    - OMIM: 604005
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BUR4

- **Aliases:** NgR1, OMGP receptor

- **AA Mutation List:** There are various missense and nonsense mutations reported in RTN4R with their respective dbSNP IDs. Some of the common ones are:
    - R66W (rs61754938)
    - F197C (rs80163465)
    - Q332*
    - Q268* (rs9315448)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** There are several somatic SNVs and InDels reported for RTN4R, but currently, there are no dbSNP IDs available for them.

- **Related Diseases:** RTN4R is associated with several diseases and disorders, including:
    - Spinal cord injury
    - Multiple sclerosis
    - Alzheimer's disease
    - Schizophrenia
    - Autism

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no known cure for the diseases associated with RTN4R, but pharmacological inhibition of RTN4R has shown promising results as a therapeutic strategy.

- **Drug Response:** Currently, there are no drugs available that directly target RTN4R, but several compounds have been reported to inhibit its activity, including:
    - NEP1-40
    - NgRH1
    - Cethrin
