## Gene: VPS33B
- **Function for gene:** The VPS33B gene encodes for the VPS33B protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of membrane trafficking between different organelles in the cell. Specifically, the protein is involved in the endosomal pathway, helping to transport vesicles from the early endosome to the late endosome and lysosome.

    - None reported

- **Related disease:** Mutations in the VPS33B gene have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 10 (HPS10), which is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and lysosomal storage defects. 

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for HPS10, and treatment is mainly focused on managing the symptoms of the disorder. This may include regular blood transfusions to manage the bleeding diathesis, skin protection measures to prevent sunburn and skin cancer, and management of the other symptoms associated with lysosomal storage defects. 

- **Drug response:** There is currently no specific drug available for the treatment of HPS10. However, some of the symptoms of the disorder may respond to treatments used for other related conditions. For example, bleeding diathesis may be managed with desmopressin or antifibrinolytic agents, while lysosomal storage defects may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.
