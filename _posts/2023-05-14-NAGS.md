# Information about Gene NAGS

## Genetic Position
- Gene: N-Acetylglutamate Synthase (NAGS)
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: q21.31

## Pathology
- Mutations in NAGS gene are associated with NAGS deficiency.
- NAGS deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by hyperammonemia.

## Function
- NAGS gene encodes for N-acetylglutamate synthase enzyme that catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl-CoA.
- NAG is an essential cofactor required for the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) enzyme which is involved in the urea cycle.
- The urea cycle is responsible for the detoxification of ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7643
- NCBI Entrez: 162417
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108468
- OMIM: 608300
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P31152
- Aliases: ACSP, NAGS1, NAGSD, PRO2927

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg140Cys (rs1057518885)
- p.Val165Leu (rs759531173)
- p.Arg76Cys (rs121908226)
- p.Arg140His (rs140265486)
- Mutations are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not available.

## Related Disease
- Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency (HPAGS)
- NAGS deficiency results in hyperammonemia, vomiting, lethargy, and encephalopathy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment involves dietary protein restriction, ammonia scavenger therapy, and supplementation with N-carbamyl-L-glutamate (NCG), an activator of CPS1.
- If left untreated, NAGS deficiency can lead to irreversible brain damage and death.
- Prognosis depends on early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and patient compliance with dietary restrictions.

## Drug Response
- NCG has shown promising results in the treatment of NAGS deficiency.
- Other drugs such as sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate can be used to lower ammonia levels in the body.
