## Gene Information

- **Gene Name:** CA12
- **Function:** The CA12 gene encodes for the protein Carbonic Anhydrase XII, which catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ions. It plays an important role in pH regulation and ion transport in a variety of tissues.
- **Aliases:** CAXII, HsT18816
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 15q22
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 1375
    - NCBI Entrez: 771
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000140463
    - OMIM: 603537
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y2D5

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the CA12 gene.

## Pathology and Related Diseases

- CA12 has been associated with various diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
- In cancer, CA12 expression has been implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in various cancer types such as breast, gastric, and lung cancer.
- In cystic fibrosis, CA12 has been shown to be downregulated in patients with the disease, affecting bicarbonate transport and contributing to mucus accumulation in the lungs.
- In neuropsychiatric disorders, CA12 has been suggested to play a role in regulating pH in the brain, with altered expression potentially contributing to mood disorders and other neurological conditions.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- The role of CA12 in various diseases suggests that it may be a potential therapeutic target. In cancer, targeting CA12 has been suggested as a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance and inhibit tumor growth. However, further research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of such treatments.
- In cystic fibrosis, therapies aimed at restoring bicarbonate transport have been suggested as potential treatments. Targeting CA12 may be one strategy to achieve this goal.
- The prognosis for patients with diseases affecting CA12 expression will depend on the specific disease and its progression.

## Drug Response

- There is limited information available on the drug response of CA12. However, some studies have suggested that CA12 expression may affect response to certain chemotherapy drugs in cancer.
