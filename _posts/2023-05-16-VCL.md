# Gene Information: VCL

## Genetic Position
The VCL gene is located on chromosome 10q22.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the VCL gene have been associated with cardiomyopathy and cancer.

## Function
The VCL gene encodes a protein called vinculin, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, spreading, and motility.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the VCL gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for dilated cardiomyopathy, but treatments such as heart medications, implantable devices, and heart transplant may be recommended. The prognosis for dilated cardiomyopathy varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

The prognosis for cancer associated with VCL mutations also varies depending on the type and stage of cancer. Treatment may involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of these approaches.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response of VCL mutations.
