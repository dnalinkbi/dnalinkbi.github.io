# Gene Information: INPP5D

## Genetic Position

INPP5D is located at chromosome 2q37.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in INPP5D have been associated with various diseases, including autoimmune diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and some solid tumors.

## Function

The INPP5D protein is a phosphatase enzyme that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), a signaling molecule that plays a role in cell growth and survival. INPP5D acts as a negative regulator of this signaling pathway, helping to prevent excessive cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are many somatic mutations in INPP5D that have been identified in various cancers. Some examples include:

- c.2089C>T (p.Ala697Val) - missense mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (dbSNP ID: rs147088864)
- c.2257C>T (p.Ala753Val) - missense mutation in melanoma (dbSNP ID: rs373755611)
- c.1871C>A (p.His624Gln) - missense mutation in breast cancer (dbSNP ID: rs1422656737)

## Related Disease

Mutations in INPP5D have been implicated in a number of diseases, including:

- Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
- Breast cancer
- Non-small cell lung cancer
- Melanoma

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for mutations in INPP5D. However, INPP5D inhibitors are being investigated as a potential treatment for certain cancers.

## Drug Response

INPP5D inhibitors are being studied for their potential to treat cancers such as lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma.
