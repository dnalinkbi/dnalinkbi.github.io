# Information about Gene KDM6A

- **Genetic Position:** KDM6A is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.3-p11.2.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in KDM6A gene are associated with various developmental disorders, including Kabuki syndrome type 2, intellectual disability, and X-linked syndromic intellectual disability. Reduced expression of KDM6A has also been reported in several cancers, such as breast, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.

- **Function:** KDM6A encodes a histone lysine demethylase enzyme that plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation by removing the methyl groups from the lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and hence facilitating gene transcription. 

- **External IDs:** 
  - Gene ID: 7403
  - Genomic Location: Xp11.3-p11.2
  - Aliases: H3-K27me3 demethylase, KIAA1876, UTX

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** 
  - **p.Tyr1025CysfsTer41 (Y1025Cfs*41):** Frameshift mutation resulting from a single base pair deletion in exon 21 of KDM6A. It causes a premature termination of the protein. [dbSNP ID: NA]
  - **p.Glu1395Lys (E1395K):** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid to lysine at position 1395 of KDM6A. It is associated with Kabuki Syndrome. [dbSNP ID: rs1555816005]

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - **c.2815C>T (p.Arg939Ter):** A nonsense mutation resulting in the substitution of arginine with premature termination codon at position 939 of KDM6A.
  - **c.743G>A (p.Asp248Asn):** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of aspartic acid with asparagine at position 248 of KDM6A. 
  [dbSNP ID: rs1401261028 and rs150872091, respectively]

- **Related Diseases:** 
  - Kabuki Syndrome type 2
  - X-linked syndromic intellectual disability

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for KDM6A related disorders is usually symptomatic and involves early intervention for developmental and cognitive delays. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and early diagnosis.

- **Drug Response:** Currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target KDM6A. However, inhibitors that target the histone demethylase activity of KDM6A are being developed as potential cancer therapies.
