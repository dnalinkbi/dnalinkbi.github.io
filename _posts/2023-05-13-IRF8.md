## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** IRF8 (Interferon regulatory factor 8)

**Genetic Position:** Chr16:1,016,873-1,023,781

**Aliases:** ICSBP, IMD32A, ISGF-3, IRF4BP1, NF-IL3A

## Function for Gene

IRF8 is a gene that encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in immune cell development and function, particularly in the maturation of dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages. IRF8 plays a critical role in the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells; it regulates the formation of a subset of dendritic cells, such as the so-called CD8a+ dendritic cells that are important for cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, IRF8 modulates B cell differentiation and immune responses, acting as a tumor suppressor in B cell lymphoma development.

## Related Disease

IRF8 mutations have been associated with primary immunodeficiency disorders, including susceptibility to infections caused by viruses, fungi, and bacteria.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for primary immunodeficiency disorders caused by IRF8 mutations. Treatment is generally supportive and aimed at controlling infections with antibiotics and antifungal agents. In some cases, bone marrow or stem cell transplantation may be considered.

## Drug Response

Studies have shown that IRF8 plays a crucial role in the response to anticancer drugs such as anthracyclines and DNA-damaging agents. IRF8 expression is correlated with a favorable prognosis in some types of cancer, and the induction of IRF8 expression has been demonstrated to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.
