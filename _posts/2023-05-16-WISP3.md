# Gene WISP3

**Function:** WISP3 is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration and is thought to be involved in regulating the activity of other signaling molecules.

**External IDs:**
- Gene ID: 8838
- Genomic location: Chromosome 6, NC_000006.12 (58081096...58132120, complement)
- Aliases: CCN6, Elm1

**External Sites:**
- HGNC: 12851
- NCBI Entrez: 8838
- Ensembl: ENSG00000112118
- OMIM: 603400
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95388

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.E24K (rs121908001)
- p.R189Q (rs121908002)
- p.C213Y (rs121908003)
- p.Q276* (rs797045285)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs17883651
- rs13016481

**Related Disease:** WISP3 mutations are associated with progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by joint stiffness, pain, and swelling.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for pseudorheumatoid dysplasia. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and physical therapy to maintain mobility.

**Drug Response:** There is limited information on the drug response of WISP3 mutations.
