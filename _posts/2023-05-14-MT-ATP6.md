## Genetic Information Analysis: Gene MT-ATP6

### Genetic Position
Gene MT-ATP6 is located on the mitochondrial DNA, specifically on the heavy strand at the nucleotide position 8,517 to 8,914.

### Pathology
Mutations in gene MT-ATP6 have been associated with a variety of mitochondrial disorders, including Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), NARP syndrome (neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa), Leigh syndrome, and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.

### Function
Gene MT-ATP6 encodes for a subunit of ATP synthase, which is an important protein complex involved in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in the respiratory chain of the mitochondria.
