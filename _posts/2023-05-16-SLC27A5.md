## Information about Gene SLC27A5

### Genetic position, pathology, and function
- Gene: SLC27A5
- Chromosome: 20
- Location: p13.13
- Pathology: Mutations in SLC27A5 have been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
- Function: SLC27A5 encodes a fatty acid transport protein that is involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the cell.

- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment and prognosis for NAFLD vary depending on the severity of the disease and the individual patient. Lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are often recommended as a first step. In more severe cases, medications or surgery may be necessary. It is important for individuals with NAFLD to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.
