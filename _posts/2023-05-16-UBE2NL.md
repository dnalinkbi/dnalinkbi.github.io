## Gene UBE2NL

### Information about Gene

**Genetic Position:** The gene UBE2NL is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p36.33.

**Pathology:** There is limited information available on the pathology of UBE2NL gene. However, studies have indicated that this gene may be involved in regulating the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway.

**Function:** The UBE2NL gene is a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family which plays a critical role in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Studies have suggested that UBE2NL may have a regulatory role in the degradation of specific proteins.
