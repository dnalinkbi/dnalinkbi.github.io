# Information about Gene TGFB3

## Genetic Position
The gene TGFB3 is located on chromosome 14q24.3.

## Pathology and Function

TGFB3 gene encodes a growth factor that plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) superfamily and involved in embryonic development, wound healing, and tissue repair.
