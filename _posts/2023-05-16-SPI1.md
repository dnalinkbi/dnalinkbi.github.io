## Gene SPI1

### Basic Information
- **Function for gene:** The SPI1 gene encodes a transcription factor protein called PU.1, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during hematopoiesis and immune cell development.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
   - Gene ID: 6688
   - Genomic location: Chromosome 11p11.2 
   - Aliases: SPI-1, SPIA, SPI-1A

### Sequence information
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several amino acid substitutions reported for SPI1 gene, including K226R (rs34400889), R235H (rs80338638), and K308E (rs76739673).
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic mutations reported for SPI1 gene
- **Related disease:** SPI1 mutations have been associated with various hematopoietic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). 
- **Treatment and prognosis:** The treatment of SPI1-related malignancies depends on the specific diagnosis and stage of the disease. Patients may receive various treatments, including chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, or targeted therapy. The prognosis of SPI1-related malignancies varies depending on the specific diagnosis, stage of the disease, and treatment response.
- **Drug response:** Various drugs are used to treat hematopoietic malignancies, and the specific treatment depends on the individual patient's diagnosis and clinical history. Some drugs used to treat hematopoietic malignancies include cytarabine, anthracyclines, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
