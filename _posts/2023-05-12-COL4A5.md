## Gene Information
**Gene Symbol:** COL4A5  
**Genomic Location:** Xq22.3  
**Aliases:** 
- Alport syndrome, X-linked, COL4A5 isoform
- ASLN
- ATS
- ANT
- Collagen alpha-5(IV) chain
- Goodpasture antigen-like 2

## Function
COL4A5 gene encodes for one of the alpha chains of type IV collagen, which are major components of basement membranes. This protein helps to provide structural support to basement membranes, which are present in almost all tissues. The basement membrane provides mechanical support and acts as a filtration barrier. COL4A5 protein is especially important in the basement membrane of the kidney glomerulus where it helps with filtration. Mutations in the COL4A5 gene makes basement membranes more prone to splitting, leading to the disintegration of the basement membrane in the kidney.

## Related Disease
Mutations in COL4A5 gene are associated with X-linked Alport syndrome, thin basement membrane nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Alport syndrome. Treatment goals focus on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. Depending on the severity of Alport syndrome, individuals may need to receive a kidney transplant or undergo dialysis. Early diagnosis, better monitoring, and improved treatments have improved prognosis for individuals with Alport syndrome.

## Drug Response
There is currently no FDA-approved treatment to cure Alport syndrome. Still, some medications like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been used to reduce proteinuria and blood pressure in patients with Alport syndrome.
