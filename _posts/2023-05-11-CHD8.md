## Information about Gene CHD8

### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
- Gene: CHD8
- Location: Chromosome 14q11.2
- Pathology: This gene has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability.
- Function: The CHD8 gene encodes a chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein that plays a role in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair.
