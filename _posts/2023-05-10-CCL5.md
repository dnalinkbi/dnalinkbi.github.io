# Gene: CCL5

### Genetic Position:
The gene CCL5 is located on chromosome 17 at position 17q21.1.

### Pathology:
CCL5 is known to play a role in inflammatory responses and immune system regulation. Dysregulation of CCL5 expression has been associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Function:
CCL5 encodes a chemokine that attracts immune cells, particularly T cells, to sites of inflammation. This chemokine also plays a role in the activation and regulation of immune cells.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 10619
- NCBI Entrez: 6352
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125770
- OMIM: 187011
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13501
- Aliases: RANTES, SIS-delta, TCP228

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Thr44Ile (rs2280788)
- p.Asn68Ser (rs2280789)
- p.Ser96Arg (rs2107538)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are several somatic SNVs/inDels in CCL5 listed in the COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) database, including:
- c.29A>G (p.Lys10Arg)
- c.211G>A (p.Arg71His)
- c.220T>C (p.Leu74Pro)

### Related Diseases:
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Asthma
- HIV infection
- Cancer (CCL5 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The dysregulated expression of CCL5 in various diseases has led to research on potential therapeutics targeting this chemokine. For example, blocking the interaction between CCL5 and its receptor, CCR5, has been explored as a potential treatment for HIV infection. Additionally, research has shown that reducing CCL5 expression may be beneficial in the treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.

### Drug Response:
The drug Maraviroc, which is a CCR5 antagonist that blocks the interaction between CCL5 and its receptor, is approved for the treatment of HIV infection.
