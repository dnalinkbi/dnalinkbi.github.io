# Information about gene CDHR1

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- **Genetic position**: CDHR1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 10 (10p12.1).
- **Pathology**: CDHR1 mutations have been linked to retinal degenerative diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD).
- **Function**: CDHR1 encodes a member of the cadherin superfamily, which are transmembrane proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and signal transduction.
