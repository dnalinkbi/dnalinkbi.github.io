# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene RPL10

## Gene Information

- **Function for gene:** RPL10 (Ribosomal Protein L10) is a ribosomal protein that plays a role in translation initiation and elongation. It is involved in the formation of the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis in cells.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 6133
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 14, 23.9 - 23.91 Mb
    - Aliases: DXS728E, MRX52, MRX67, QM, QM-like, DXS728, RPLP4, RPS10P3
    
- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: 10398
    - NCBI Entrez: 6133
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000126653
    - OMIM: 312173
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P62917

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Arg98Cys - rs201930440
    - p.Gly101Arg - rs201727601
    - p.Arg98His - rs398122352
    - p.Glu117Lys - rs727504932

    *Note: There are other mutations reported in literature, but these are the most common ones with dbSNP IDs.*

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported as of now.

## Related Diseases

RPL10 mutation is related to a rare X-linked syndrome called Jugular Vermo-Skeletal Abnormalities or JVSA. Patients with JVSA show multiple abnormalities such as a prominent forehead, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, and jugular spine defects. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, no treatment or prognosis information is available for RPL10 mutations.

## Drug Response

Information on drug response is currently unavailable.
