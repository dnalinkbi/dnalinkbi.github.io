# Gene PRDM1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** PRDM1 gene is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q21.
- **Pathology:** PRDM1 is associated with several pathological conditions such as B-cell lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and autoimmune diseases.
- **Function:** The PRDM1 gene encodes a protein called PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1), which acts as a transcription factor. It plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of B cells and T cells by regulating the expression of various genes involved in these processes.

## Gene Information
- **External IDs:** 
   - HGNC: 9352
   - NCBI Entrez: 63971
   - Ensembl: ENSG00000137265
   - OMIM: 605906
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9SUX7
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 6 (6q21)
- **Aliases:** BLIMP1, PRDI-BF1, ZNF163

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** Several amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported in the PRDM1 gene. Some of these are:
   - R23G (rs3732228)
   - H187R (rs3732227)
   - Q518E (rs35871104)
   - R665W (rs119540256)
   - R694C (rs121913509)
- **Mutation Type:** Missense variants
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs3732228, rs3732227, rs35871104, rs119540256, rs121913509

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- Several somatic SNVs and InDels have been reported in the PRDM1 gene in different types of cancer, including:
   - c.1075G>A
   - c.139G>A
   - c.1470C>T
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs1473923876, rs397515564, rs146209147

## Related Disease
- PRDM1 is associated with several diseases, including:
   - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
   - Multiple myeloma
   - Autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with PRDM1 mutations depend on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation. There is ongoing research to develop targeted therapies for these conditions.

## Drug Response
- Some studies have reported that PRDM1 expression is associated with drug resistance in certain types of cancer, suggesting that targeting PRDM1 could be a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance.
