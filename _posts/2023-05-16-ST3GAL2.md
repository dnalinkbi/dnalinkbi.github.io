# Gene Information for ST3GAL2

## Genetic Position
**ST3GAL2** gene is located on chromosome 16 (16q23.1). It spans approximately 13.4 kb of DNA and it contains 9 exons.

## Pathology
A mutation in the **ST3GAL2** gene is associated with Spastic Paraplegia 20 (SPG20), which is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spasticity and intellectual disability.

## Function
ST3GAL2 encodes a type II membrane-bound glycosyltransferase which is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to a terminal galactose residue on glycoproteins and glycolipids.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no information available about somatic mutations in the ST3GAL2 gene.

## Related Disease
The mutation in ST3GAL2 gene is associated with Spastic Paraplegia 20 (SPG20). Clinical features of SPG20 may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, optic atrophy, distal amyotrophy, and peripheral neuropathy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for SPG20. Management of symptoms depends on the severity and may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and assistive devices.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug available for the treatment of SPG20.
