## Gene CASP12 Information

### Genetic Position
CASP12 (Caspase 12) is located on Chromosome 11 at the position q23.3.

### Pathology
Studies have shown an association between Caspase 12 deficiency and severe sepsis and septic shock in humans. 

### Function
Caspase 12 is a cysteine protease that functions as a negative regulator of the inflammasome and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. It plays a role in the innate immune response by mediating the processing and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
