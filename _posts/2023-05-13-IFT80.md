# Information about Gene IFT80

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- Gene Name: IFT80 (Intraflagellar Transport 80)
- Chromosome: 3
- Location: 3q21.3
- Pathology: Mutations in IFT80 are associated with various ciliopathies, including short-rib thoracic dysplasia, Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, and Jeune syndrome.

## Function for Gene

The IFT80 gene encodes a component of a multimeric intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex A, which is necessary for the formation and maintenance of cilia, an organelle that plays a role in cell signaling, motility, and sensory perception.
