# Gene ME2

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- **Genetic Position:** ME2 is a gene located on Chromosome 18 at position 18q21.1.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the ME2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.

## Function

ME2 encodes a protein called NADP-dependent malic enzyme 2 (ME2). This enzyme is part of the metabolic pathway that converts malate to pyruvate, which is then used to generate energy in the form of ATP. ME2 plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and adipose tissue.

- **Aliases:** NADP-dependent malic enzyme 2, ME2, Malic enzyme 2, mitochondrial

## Mutation Information

- **AA Mutation List:** A list of ME2 protein mutations can be found in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.
- **Mutation Type:** Missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations have all been reported in the ME2 gene.
- **dbSNP ID:** Variants in the ME2 gene can be found in the dbSNP database.
