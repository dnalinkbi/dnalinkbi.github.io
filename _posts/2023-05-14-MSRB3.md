## Gene Information

### Gene: MSRB3

MSRB3 is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q24.23. It is also known as Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase B3. 

### Function

The protein encoded by the MSRB3 gene belongs to the MsrB family of oxidoreductases, which are involved in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. It reduces methionine sulfoxide to methionine, thereby protecting cells against oxidative stress. 

### External IDs and Aliases 

- HGNC ID: HGNC:23415 
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 84442 
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000135100 
- OMIM ID: 610220 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9BVW5 

Aliases: METH-2, METH2, MsrB3, CGI-67 

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There have been several missense mutations reported in the MSRB3 gene. Some of the common ones with their respective dbSNP IDs are:

- p.Cys41Tyr (rs115463034)
- p.Gly4Arg (rs145223460)
- p.Tyr113Asp (rs115463024)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there is no information available regarding somatic SNVs/InDels in the MSRB3 gene. 

### Related Disease

Mutations in the MSRB3 gene have been linked to deafness. It has been reported that the loss of function mutations in the MSRB3 gene can lead to nonsyndromic deafness, autosomal recessive 74 (DFNB74).

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments available for deafness caused by MSRB3 gene mutations. Treatment options are limited to hearing aids, cochlear implants and sign language education.
 
### Drug Response

There is no information available regarding drug response related to MSRB3 gene mutations.
