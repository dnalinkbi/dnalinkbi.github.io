## Gene information for CYBB

### Genetic Position
The CYBB gene is located on the X chromosome at the position Xp21.1.

### Pathology
The CYBB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide, which is a component of an enzyme called NADPH oxidase. This enzyme is responsible for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a vital role in fighting infections. Defects in CYBB gene result in X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to the inability of immune cells to produce ROS.

### Function
The CYBB gene encodes a protein that functions as a component of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. Together with other proteins, this enzyme produces reactive oxygen species to help fight infections by killing pathogens such as bacteria and fungi.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported

### Related Diseases
- X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Patients with CGD require treatment with prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals to prevent infections. Bone marrow transplantation can also be done in extreme cases. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
There is currently no approved drug therapy for CGD. However, some studies suggest that interferon gamma may improve the function of immune cells in some patients.
