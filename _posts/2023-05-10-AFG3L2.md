# Information about Gene AFG3L2

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: AFG3L2 (ATPase family gene 3-like 2)
- Chromosome: 18
- Location: 18p11.21
- Pathology: Mutations in AFG3L2 are associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 28 (SCA28), a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects the cerebellum and is characterized by progressive ataxia, tremors, and difficulty speaking and walking.

## Function for Gene
- AFG3L2 encodes a mitochondrial ATP-dependent metalloprotease that plays a role in the degradation of misfolded and unassembled mitochondrial proteins.
- It is also involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity and in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.
