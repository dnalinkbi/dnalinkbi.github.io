# Information about Gene RBP3

## Genetic Position
The RBP3 gene is located on chromosome 10q26.13. It spans over 38,758 bases (GRCh38).

## Pathology
Mutations in the RBP3 gene have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa, which is a group of inherited disorders that affect the light-sensitive cells of the retina.

## Function
The RBP3 gene encodes for the inter-photoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, which is involved in the transport and storage of retinoids in the eye.

- Retinitis pigmentosa

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but treatment may help slow down the progression of the disease.

## Drug response
There is currently no specific drug designed for retinitis pigmentosa, but some treatments such as vitamin A supplementation and gene therapy have shown some success in slowing down the progression of the disease.
