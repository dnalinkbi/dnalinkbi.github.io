# Information about gene CALM1

## Genetic Position
The CALM1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14 at the position 14q32.11.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CALM1 gene have been associated with various diseases, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF).

## Function for gene
The CALM1 gene encodes the calmodulin 1 protein, which is a calcium-binding protein that regulates various signaling pathways in cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic mutations have been reported for the CALM1 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
- Long QT syndrome
- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
- Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for disorders associated with CALM1 mutations may include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and implantation of cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) devices. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and response to treatment.

## Drug response
Patients with CALM1 mutations may respond differently to certain medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
