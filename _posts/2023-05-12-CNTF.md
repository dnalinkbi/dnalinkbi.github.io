## Gene: CNTF

CNTF is a gene located on chromosome 11q12.1 (genomic position: 28,462,148-28,468,802). It belongs to the cytokine family and codes for Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) protein. CNTF protein is involved in the regulation of neuronal and glial degeneration and regeneration. 

### Function
The CNTF protein plays a crucial role in neuronal survival, differentiation, and function. It also has an inhibitory effect on the differentiation of adipocytes. CNTF belongs to the IL-6 family of cytokines and acts by binding to its receptor, which triggers the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 2176
- NCBI Entrez: 1270
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000110332
- OMIM ID: 118945
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P26441
- Aliases: HCNTF, CDF, CLCF1

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the CNTF gene that are associated with various diseases. For example:
- rs1800169: A>G substitution leading to Ile->Val amino acid change in the signal peptide. This mutation has been associated with increased risk of obesity and insulin resistance.
- rs1800170: G>A substitution leading to Val->Met amino acid change in the mature protein. This mutation has been associated with reduced muscle strength and increased body fat.
- rs1800166: C>T substitution leading to Pro->Ser amino acid change in the mature protein. This mutation has been associated with increased risk of schizophrenia.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations (SNVs/InDels) reported in the CNTF gene in various cancer types. For instance:
- rs79739216: C>A substitution leading to Gly->Cys amino acid change in solid tumors such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancer.
- rs200305308: C>A substitution leading to Leu->Met amino acid change in cholangiocarcinoma.

### Related disease
The CNTF gene has been implicated in various diseases, including:
- Obesity and insulin resistance
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
- Schizophrenia
- Multiple sclerosis
- Colorectal cancer
- Breast cancer

### Treatment and prognosis
Research has shown that administration of exogenous CNTF protein may improve muscle function and reduce fat mass in animal models. In human trials, CNTF has shown potential for promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity in obese individuals. For ALS, CNTF therapy has not been proven effective in clinical trials.

### Drug response
CNTF has been tested for its potential use in treating ALS, but clinical trials have not shown significant efficacy. There are currently no drugs available that target the CNTF protein.
