## Gene Information

### Gene Name: 
ACVR1 (Activin receptor type-1)

### Pathology:
ACVR1 mutations have been associated with various diseases including Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).


### Function for gene
ACVR1 gene encodes a type I receptor for TGF-beta family ligands. ACVR1 activation promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and also plays a crucial role in controlling embryonic development, organogenesis and morphogenesis.

### Treatment and prognosis
- There is currently no cure for Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP), but treatments are available to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.


### Drug response
- Palovarotene (RAP-031) is the first drug in clinical trial for the treatment of FOP.
