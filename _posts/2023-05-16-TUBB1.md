## Gene: TUBB1
### Summary
The TUBB1 gene encodes a class I beta-tubulin protein which is a subunit of microtubules. Microtubules are cylindrical polymers of tubulin that play crucial roles in cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the TUBB1 gene have been found to be associated with primary microcephaly, a condition characterized by significantly reduced head circumference and intellectual disability. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for primary microcephaly, and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. Prognosis may depend on the severity of the condition and the presence of additional symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response specifically related to TUBB1 mutations.
