# Information about Gene PDSS2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position:** 
PDSS2 is located on chromosome 6 in humans. Its genomic coordinates are 6q25.1.

**Pathology:**
PDSS2 mutations have been associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder which causes a range of clinical symptoms including muscle weakness, severe infantile multisystemic disease, and encephalopathy. 

**Function:**
PDSS2 is involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, also known as coenzyme Q10, which is a membrane-bound electron carrier involved in cellular respiration. PDSS2 encodes a protein that acts as a subunit of the decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (DDPS) complex, which catalyzes the formation of the side chain of coenzyme Q10.

## Gene Information

**Function for gene:**
PDSS2 encodes a protein that is involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 which is a critical component in cellular respiration.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
Limited information available in the literature on somatic SNVs/InDels in PDSS2.

**Related Disease:**
Mutations in PDSS2 have been associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
Currently, there is no cure for coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Treatment typically involves the use of high-dose coenzyme Q10 supplementation, sometimes in combination with other compounds such as vitamins E and C. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and when treatment is initiated.

**Drug Response:**
Limited information is available on drug response to PDSS2 mutations. However, high-dose coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been reported to be effective in some cases of coenzyme Q10 deficiency.
