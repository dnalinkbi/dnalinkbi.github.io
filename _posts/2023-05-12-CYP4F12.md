# Gene CYP4F12

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 19; 12,737,929 - 12,748,022 bp
- **Pathology:** CYP4F12 mutations have been associated with the development of essential hypertension and obesity in certain populations.
- **Function:** The CYP4F12 gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of various fatty acid substrates, including arachidonic acid.
