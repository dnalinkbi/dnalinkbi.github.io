### Gene: NFKBIE

#### Function:
The NFKBIE gene is involved in the regulation of the NF-kappa-B transcription factor, which plays a crucial role in immune response, inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as an inhibitor of NF-kappa-B, and its expression is regulated by various external stimuli. 

#### External IDs and Genomic Location:
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 8480
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000100906
- HGNC ID: 7762
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 6q21

#### Aliases:
- I-kappa-B epsilon
- IkB-epsilon
- IKBE
- MGC138448
- MAD-3

#### AA Mutation List:
There are several mutations reported in the NFKBIE gene. Some of these mutations and their types are as follows:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| G59R | Missense | rs149034191 |
| T80A | Missense | rs878853238 |
| G111R | Missense | rs1554865094 |
| D145A | Missense | rs267607155 |
| E151K | Missense | rs199528424 |

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
Several somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variations) and InDels (Insertions and Deletions) have been reported in the NFKBIE gene. Some of the significant SNVs/InDels with their dbSNP IDs are given as follows:

| Mutation | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ------- |
| c.352delA | rs779596919 |
| c.356dupT | rs768998084 |
| c.796C>A | rs760485308 |
| c.959A>T | rs774991329 |

#### Related Diseases:
Mutations in the NFKBIE gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Hodgkin's lymphoma
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
- Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- Pancreatic cancer

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with NFKBIE mutations vary according to the severity of the disease and other factors. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies, and stem cell transplantation. The prognosis may depend on the type and stage of cancer and other factors like age and overall health.

#### Drug Response:
Some drugs have been found to be effective in the treatment of cancers associated with NFKBIE mutations, including:
- Bortezomib
- Imatinib
- Lenalidomide
- Velcade
- Rituximab
