# Information about gene PARL

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Position**: PARL gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q26.33).
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the PARL gene have been associated with various diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and spastic paraplegia 60 (SPG60), which are all neurodegenerative disorders.
- **Function**: The PARL gene encodes a protein called presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL), which is a mitochondrial rhomboid protease. This protein is involved in several cellular pathways including mitochondrial dynamics, cell death, and protein quality control. It has been shown that PARL cleaves several mitochondrial proteins, including the mitofusin 2 (MFN2), which is involved in mitochondrial fusion.

## Gene Information

- **Function for gene**: Mitochondrial rhomboid protease PARL is involved in various cellular processes including mitochondrial dynamics, cell death, and protein quality control.
- **External ID**: HGNC: 2121; NCBI Entrez: 55464; Ensembl: ENSG00000163567; OMIM: 605298; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H492
- **Aliases**: PGI2IP, PARL-1, PARL_HUMAN, presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein.

## Mutations and Polymorphisms

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: Several missense mutations have been identified in the PARL gene including p.R377C, p.R377H, p.R216Q, and p.T508M. These mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Limited information is available on the somatic mutations in the PARL gene. However, a few studies have reported somatic mutations of this gene in various types of cancers including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.
- **Related disease**: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spastic paraplegia 60.
- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is currently no cure for PD, AD and SPG60. Treatment and prognosis for these diseases vary depending on the symptoms and severity of the disease.
- **Drug response**: Several drugs are used to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, the response to treatment varies from patient to patient. In addition, there is no specific treatment for spastic paraplegia 60.
