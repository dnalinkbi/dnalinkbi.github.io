## Information on Gene ANKS1A

**Genetic Position:** ANKS1A (Ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 1A) is located on chromosome 13 at 13q12.3.

**Pathology:** Currently, there is no known pathology or association with disease for the ANKS1A gene.

**Function:** ANKS1A encodes a protein that contains ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domains. The ANKS1A protein is thought to play a role in cell signaling and the regulation of nuclear transport.
