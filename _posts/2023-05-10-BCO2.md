## Gene BCO2

#### Pathology and Function

The gene BCO2 encodes beta-carotene oxygenase 2, which is a member of the heme-containing beta-carotene oxygenase family. It converts dietary provitamin A carotenoids to retinal, which is necessary for vision. Mutations in this gene can cause an impairing of visual function.
