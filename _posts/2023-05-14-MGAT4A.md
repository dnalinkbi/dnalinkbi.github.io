# Gene: MGAT4A

## Genomic Position

MGAT4A gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3. The specific cytogenetic location is 3q27.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in the MGAT4A gene may lead to glycosyltransferase deficiency, which is associated with altered glycosylation and may result in abnormal cellular functions, such as receptor-ligand interactions, signaling pathways, and immune responses.

## Function

MGAT4A encodes a protein that belongs to the glycosyltransferase family and plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of complex N-linked glycans. The protein transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to the beta-linked mannose of glycoproteins, initiating the synthesis of hybrid and complex N-linked glycans.

## AA Mutation and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Several amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for the MGAT4A gene. These mutations are mostly missense mutations that alter the protein structure and function. Some of the reported AA mutations with their mutation types and dbSNP ID are:

- L283P: Missense Mutation, rs376939481
- L400V: Missense Mutation, rs267606793
- S488F: Missense Mutation, rs201970150

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Few somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (InDels) have been reported in the MGAT4A gene. Some of the SNVs and InDels with their dbSNP ID are:

- rs146821239: A>T substitution
- rs149887266: C>G substitution

## Related Disease

Mutations in the MGAT4A gene have been associated with several diseases and disorders, including:

- Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIq (CDG-IIq)
- Parkinson's disease
- Multiple system atrophy
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Polycystic ovary syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for CDG-IIq caused by MGAT4A mutations. Patients with CDG are usually treated symptomatically, and their prognosis depends on the severity and progression of their symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is no specific drug response or treatment available for MGAT4A-related disorders. However, some patients with CDG-IIq have shown improvement in their symptoms with mannose supplementation therapy.
