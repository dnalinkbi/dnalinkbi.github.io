## Gene: GCNT1

- **Function:** The GCNT1 gene encodes for the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase enzyme, which adds GalNAc residues to the core 1 structure of O-glycan chains on cell surface proteins. This enzyme is involved in glycosylation and cell signaling processes.

- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC ID: 4178
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 2654
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000151532
    - OMIM ID: 600429
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q92697

- **Aliases:** GalNAc-T, GalNAc-T1, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1

- **AA mutation list:**
    - p.Phe223SerfsTer34 - frameshift mutation causing a premature stop codon.
    - p.Val137Leu - missense mutation resulting in a change of amino acid from valine to leucine.
    - p.Ser38Phe - missense mutation resulting in a change of amino acid from serine to phenylalanine.
    
- **Mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs558361086 - frameshift mutation causing a premature stop codon.
    - rs750041967 - missense mutation resulting in a change of amino acid from valine to leucine.
    - rs766286869 - missense mutation resulting in a change of amino acid from serine to phenylalanine.
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs146888370 - missense mutation resulting in a change of amino acid from glycine to arginine in ovarian serous carcinoma.
    - rs767062784 - synonymous mutation in glioblastoma multiforme.
    
- **Related disease:** Mutations in the GCNT1 gene have been associated with colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options for cancers associated with GCNT1 mutations include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis varies depending on several factors, including the stage of cancer, age of the patient, and overall health.

- **Drug response:** The GCNT1 gene may play a role in drug response and resistance. More research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved.
