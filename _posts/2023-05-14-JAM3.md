# Gene JAM3

## Genetic Position
Junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q25) and spans approximately 7.5 kilobases.

## Pathology and Function
JAM3 plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and contributes to various pathological processes including inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer. The encoded protein is a member of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family of proteins and is highly expressed in endothelial cells. JAM3 has been implicated in the regulation and maintenance of endothelial tight junctions, and also participates in leukocyte transmigration across the endothelium.
