## Gene: MYO7B

### Information
- **Position:** Chromosome 2 (2q31.1)
- **Pathology:** It is associated with hearing loss, specifically autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARSNSL).
- **Function:** Myosin motor proteins bind to actin filaments and are involved in intracellular movement, including the transport of organelles, vesicles, and mRNA. MYO7B is a type of myosin that is expressed in the inner ear and plays a role in the transportation of stereocilia components between the cell body and the stereocilia tips.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid mutations have been reported for MYO7B.

### Somatic SNVs / InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations have been reported for MYO7B.

### Related Disease
- Autosomal Recessive Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss (ARSNSL)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for ARSNSL caused by mutations in the MYO7B gene. Treatment options may include the use of hearing aids or cochlear implants.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the hearing loss.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug response associated with MYO7B mutations.
