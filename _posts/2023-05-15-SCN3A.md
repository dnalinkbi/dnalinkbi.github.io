# Information about Gene SCN3A 

- **Genetic Position:** SCN3A gene is located on the long arm of Chromosome 2 (2q24.3).
- **Pathology:** Mutations in SCN3A gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders including early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability.
- **Function:** SCN3A gene encodes for the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.3 which plays an important role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. 
- **Aliases:** Nav1.3, voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit Nav1.3
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC ID: HGNC:10501
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 6329
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000144306
    - OMIM ID: 607014
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NY46
- **AA Mutation list with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:**
    - c.1978T>C (p.Leu660Pro) - Missense - rs137853221
    - c.1889A>G (p.Ile630Val) - Missense - rs137853220
    - c.3053A>G (p.His1018Arg) - Missense - rs756836444
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.4829A>G - rs786201836
    - c.6062C>T - rs770750454
- **Related diseases:** Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options vary depending on the specific disorder/disease caused by SCN3A mutations. Prognosis also depends on the severity and type of the mutation. 
- **Drug response:** Some sodium channel blockers such as phenytoin and carbamazepine have shown efficacy in treating epilepsy caused by SCN3A mutations.
