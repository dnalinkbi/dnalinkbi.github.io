# Information about gene TEK

## Genetic position

- Gene: TEK
- Chromosome: 9
- Location: p21.32

## Pathology

The TEK gene has been associated with several diseases, including:

- Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease 2 (PVOD2)
- Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 (HHT2)
- Arteriovenous malformations of cerebral vessels
- Venous malformations, multiple cutaneous and mucosal

## Function

The TEK gene encodes the protein angiopoietin-1 receptor, which plays a crucial role in the development of blood vessels (angiogenesis). Specifically, it interacts with the angiopoietin-1 ligand to ensure proper vascularization of different tissues.

## External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC: 11734
- NCBI Entrez: 7010
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104654
- OMIM: 600221
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q02763
- Aliases: TIE-2, CD202b antigen

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Several amino acid mutations have been identified in the TEK gene, including:

- p.Leu914Phe (rs747581603)
- p.Arg849Trp (rs121908269)
- p.Gly693Ser (rs1065080)

These mutations are associated with different types of HHT2 and PVOD2.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have been identified in the TEK gene, including:

- c.2956C>T (rs61754045)
- c.4118_4119delinsAA (rs876658011)
- c.1733G>A (rs779113383)

These mutations are associated with different types of cancers, such as breast, lung, and ovarian cancer.

## Related disease

As mentioned before, the TEK gene is associated with several diseases, including HHT2, PVOD2, arteriovenous malformations of cerebral vessels, and venous malformations.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no cure for HHT2 or PVOD2. Treatment options include medication to manage symptoms and prevent complications, surgery, and embolization. The prognosis for these diseases varies and can be severe, depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug response

Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting the TEK gene or its protein. However, there are drugs targeting the angiogenesis pathway, which could be potentially beneficial for patients with HHT2 or PVOD2.
