# Genetic Information Analysis: Gene IL4 

## Gene Information

- **Function**: The IL4 gene encodes for a cytokine that plays a role in the immune response, specifically in the differentiation of T-helper cells, regulation of antibody isotype switching, and the growth and differentiation of B-cells.
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 3565 
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 5 (NC_000005.10): 133,831,958-133,834,610
    - Aliases: BCGF1, BSF1, IL-4, MGC79402

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**:

There are several somatic mutations in the IL4 gene that have been reported in various cancers, including:
- c.472A>G (p.His158Arg) - Lung adenocarcinoma (Cosmic ID: COSM5092260)
- c.328A>T (p.His110Phe) - Lung adenocarcinoma (Cosmic ID: COSM1400088)

## Related Diseases

Variants in the IL4 gene have been associated with various diseases and disorders, including:
- Asthma
- Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Alzheimer’s Disease
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

IL4 has been suggested as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various diseases, such as asthma and allergy. It has also been implicated in the development and progression of certain cancers, making it a potential target for cancer therapy.

## Drug Response

Various drugs have been developed that target the IL4 pathway, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. For example, Dupilumab is an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that targets the IL4 receptor and is used to treat moderate-to-severe asthma and atopic dermatitis.
