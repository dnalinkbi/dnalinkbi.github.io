## Gene Information 

### Gene: SCA26

#### Function 
SCA26 (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 26) is a gene that encodes protein known as Protein kinase C gamma isoform (PKC Î³). This protein is highly expressed in the cerebellum, and it plays a crucial role in the development and function of Purkinje cells.

- Spinocerebellar ataxia type 26 (SCA26)

#### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for SCA26, and treatment is mainly symptomatic. Neuroprotective agents such as CoQ10 and vitamin E may help in delaying the progression of ataxia in some cases. The prognosis of SCA26 is variable, with some patients experiencing a slow and progressive course, while others may have an intermittent or episodic form of ataxia.

#### Drug Response

There is no specific drug treatment available for SCA26 at present.
