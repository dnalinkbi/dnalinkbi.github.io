# Information about Gene TMPRSS15

## Genetic Position and Alias
- The gene TMPRSS15 is located on Chromosome 21 at the q21.3 position.
- Some of the aliases for this gene are enterokinase, enteropeptidase, and ENTK.

## Function
- The TMPRSS15 gene encodes a protein called enterokinase, which plays a crucial role in digestion by cleaving and activating other enzymes in the small intestine.

## External IDs and Sites
- HGNC: 11899
- NCBI Entrez: 5651
- Ensembl: ENSG00000189220
- OMIM: 602090
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P98073

## Variations
- Some of the AA mutations that have been found in the TMPRSS15 gene are p.Ala49Thr, p.Phe98Leu, and p.Asp248Asn. 
- These mutations are associated with intestinal malabsorption and diarrhea.
- The dbSNP IDs for these mutations are rs7903147, rs61747728, and rs147038420, respectively.
- Additionally, somatic SNVs/InDels have been found in various cancers including lung, skin, and thyroid.
- The dbSNP IDs for these SNVs/InDels are available in the NCBI dbSNP database.

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in the TMPRSS15 gene can cause enterokinase deficiency, which is characterized by chronic diarrhea and reduced absorption of nutrients.
- Additionally, research has linked TMPRSS15 mutations to an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for enterokinase deficiency, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications.
- Personalized treatment can be recommended based on the specific mutation present in the TMPRSS15 gene.
- The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the enterokinase deficiency and how well symptoms can be managed.

## Drug Response
- Some studies have suggested that certain drugs, such as protease inhibitors, may be effective in treating enterokinase deficiency. However, more research is needed in this area.
