# Gene: NUDT1

## Genetic Position

NUDT1 is located on chromosome 8q24.3.

## Pathology and Function

NUDT1 is a nucleotide metabolism enzyme that acts as a negative regulator of the cellular response to oxidative stress. It is involved in the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-guanosine triphosphate and 8-oxo-dGTP to the monophosphate forms, which prevents them from being incorporated into DNA and causing mutations. Mutations in NUDT1 have been associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer, including lung and breast cancer.

## Related Disease

Mutations in NUDT1 have been associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer, including lung and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis of cancers associated with NUDT1 mutations depend on the specific cancer type and stage. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of targeted therapies for NUDT1-associated cancers.

## Drug Response

Research has indicated that NUDT1 may play a role in the development of drug resistance in certain types of cancer cells. Targeting NUDT1 with specific inhibitors may offer a novel approach to overcoming this drug resistance.
