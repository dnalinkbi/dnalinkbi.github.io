# Genetic Information Analysis Report

## Gene: ATP1A2

### Genomic Position
The ATP1A2 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1q23.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the ATP1A2 gene are associated with familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2), a rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder mainly characterized by migraine with aura and hemiparesis. 

### Function
The ATP1A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, which plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular ion homeostasis in neurons. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 874 
- NCBI Entrez: 478
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163809
- OMIM: 182340
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P50993

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.275C>T (p.Arg92Cys) - rs104894756
- c.577G>A (p.Gly193Asp) 
- c.3397C>T (p.Arg1133Trp) - rs1552977017

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic SNVs/InDels has been reported for ATP1A2 gene in dbSNP.

### Related Disease 
Mutations in ATP1A2 are associated with the following conditions:
- Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for FHM2. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of migraine and preventing attacks. Medications commonly used include anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies. 

### Drug Response
Studies have shown that some individuals with FHM2 have had a positive response to anti-epileptic medications such as topiramate, acetazolamide, and lamotrigine.
