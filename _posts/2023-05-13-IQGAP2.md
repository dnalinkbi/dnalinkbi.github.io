## Gene: IQGAP2
    
### Genetic Position 
IQGAP2 is located in the chromosome 5q13.2 region.

### Pathology 
Pathogenic mutations in IQGAP2 have been associated with epilepsy.

### Function for gene
IQGAP2 encodes a scaffold protein that plays an important role in neuronal development and cognition. It is involved in the formation and regulation of synapses.
