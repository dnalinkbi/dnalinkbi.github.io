# Gene Information

## Gene Name: WHSC1 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1)

### Function for gene:

WHSC1 encodes a histone lysine N-methyltransferase (HMT) protein that appears to play a role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription regulation. It catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to lysine 36 of histone H3, resulting in the mono- and dimethylation of this residue. This epigenetic modification is involved in the regulation of gene expression during development, cell differentiation, and cell growth.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:

- HGNC ID: 12615
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 7468
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000178700
- OMIM ID: 602952
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O60820

Aliases: NSD2, TRX5, MMSET

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

There are multiple mutations reported for WHSC1 gene in different cancers including Acute Monocytic Leukemia (AML). These mutations include missense/nonsense mutations and indels, resulting in the truncation or alteration of the WHSC1 protein. 

Some of the reported mutations are as follows:

| Mutation Type | AA Change | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missense | R2117G | rs139354505 |
| Nonsense | Q1203* | rs786205187 |
| Missense | P195R | rs397515409 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There are multiple somatic SNVs and InDels reported for the WHSC1 gene in different cancers. Some of the reported variants are listed below with their corresponding dbSNP IDs.

| Variant Type | Position | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SNV | chr4:140,041,950 | rs886042642 |
| SNV | chr4:140,040,082 | rs1064793882 |
| InDel | chr4:140,100,122 | rs1555383818 |

### Related disease:

- Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome
- Multiple myeloma
- Leukemia
- Solid tumors

### Treatment and prognosis:

The treatment and prognosis of WHSC1-associated diseases depend on the severity of the condition and the type of cancer. Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is managed mainly through symptomatic treatment, while multiple myeloma and leukemia are treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies. Prognosis varies depending on the stage of the cancer and other factors.

### Drug response:

Some compounds have been reported to inhibit WHSC1 activity, including quinoline-based compounds, chaetocin, and PFI-2. These compounds may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of WHSC1-associated cancers.
