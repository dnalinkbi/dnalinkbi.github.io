# Gene NSD1
## Overview
NSD1 (Nuclear receptor SET domain protein 1) is a gene encoding a protein that contains a SET domain, which is responsible for histone methyltransferase activity. NSD1 is located on human chromosome 5q35 and mutations in this gene have been associated with developmental disorders. 

### Function for gene
NSD1 regulates the expression of genes involved in various developmental processes, such as growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis.

### Related disease
NSD1 mutations have been associated with Sotos syndrome, a rare developmental disorder characterized by rapid growth and intellectual disability.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for Sotos syndrome, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms. Early intervention with speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and special education can improve a child’s developmental outcomes.

### Drug response
Currently, there is no specific drug treatment for Sotos syndrome.
