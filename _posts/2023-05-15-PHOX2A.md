# Information on Gene PHOX2A

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position:** The PHOX2A gene is located on chromosome 11q13.2 and consists of 2 exons.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the PHOX2A gene have been associated with Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder characterized by respiratory insufficiency that typically presents in infancy.

**Function:** The PHOX2A gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of the autonomic nervous system, particularly in the differentiation of neural crest cells that give rise to sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.

## Gene Information

**Function for Gene:** Transcription factor involved in the differentiation and development of the autonomic nervous system.

## Related Disease

Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS)

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for CCHS may involve lifelong mechanical ventilation and/or a diaphragm pacing system. Prognosis depends on disease severity and management.

## Drug Response

No drugs have been specifically developed for the treatment of CCHS. However, various medications may be used to manage symptoms.
