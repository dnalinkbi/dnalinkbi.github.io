## Gene RGR

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 10
- Genomic coordinates: 96,684,868-96,719,731 (GRCh38)
- Strand: -
- Pathology: the gene is not associated with any known genetic disorders.

### Function
- RGR (Retinal G protein-coupled receptor) gene encodes for a visual pigment protein which is crucial for vision in low-light environments.
- It plays a key role in transferring information from the light-absorbing molecules of the retina, called opsins, to the brain.
- Mutations in RGR gene can cause night blindness or other visual impairments.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:9937
- NCBI Entrez ID: 5992
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000114755
- OMIM ID: 180104
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q16518
- Aliases: RP55, RGR1, RGR2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.713G>A (p.Arg238His) - rs1801267
- c.923T>C (p.Ile308Thr) - rs1801268
- c.1271G>A (p.Arg424Gln) - rs1801269

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- None reported.

### Related Disease
- Night blindness, congenital stationary, autosomal dominant 3 (OMIM #610444)
- Retinitis pigmentosa (OMIM #180380)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for genetic diseases caused by mutations in RGR gene.
- However, corrective lens or other visual aids may help improve visual function in affected individuals.

### Drug Response
- No known specific drug response available for RGR gene mutation-related diseases.
