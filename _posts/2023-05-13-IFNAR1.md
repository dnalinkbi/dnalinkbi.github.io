# Information about Gene IFNAR1

## Genetic Position 
IFNAR1 (Interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1) gene is located at locus 21q22.11 on chromosome 21. The gene spans 148.7 kb and has 20 exons.

## Pathology and Function
IFNAR1 gene is involved in the response to type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the cytokine receptor family, and is an essential component of the type I IFN receptor. Binding of type I IFNs to the receptor activates a downstream signaling cascade that results in the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This pathway plays an important role in the immune response to viral infection and cancer.

## Related Disease
Deficiencies in the IFNAR1 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to a variety of viral infections, including the hepatitis C virus. Additionally, mutations in this gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Human recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has been used as a treatment for viral infections and cancer. However, response rates vary depending on the specific disease and patient characteristics. Prognosis for patients with IFNAR1 deficiencies is generally good with proper treatment.

## Drug Response
The expression level of IFNAR1 has been identified as a potential predictor of response to IFN-alpha treatment in patients with viral infections and cancer.
