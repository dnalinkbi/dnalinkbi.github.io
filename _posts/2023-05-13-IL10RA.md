# IL10RA Gene

## Genetic Position

The IL10RA gene is located on chromosome 11q23.3.

## Pathology

Mutations in the IL10RA gene have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

## Function

The IL10RA gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of the immune system. The protein binds to interleukin-10 (IL-10) and plays a crucial role in signaling the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10.
