# Gene BTD

## Information about Gene BTD

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 3 (3p25.1)

**Pathology**: BTD gene mutations cause biotinidase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder that impairs the recycling of biotin. 

**Function**: The BTD gene codes for the enzyme biotinidase, which is responsible for the release of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides, thereby allowing the recycling of biotin.  

**External IDs and Genomic Locations**:
- Aliases: BTD, BT, DT1B, MCDR1
- HGNC ID: 1123
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 686
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000138798
- OMIM ID: 609019
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P43251

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
- c.98C>T (p.Ala33Val) rs72555383
- c.599A>G (p.Asn200Ser) rs61751414
- c.1330G>A (p.Gly444Arg) rs28942080


**Somatic SNVs/InDels and their dbSNP ID**
None reported.

**Related Disease**: Biotinidase deficiency

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Biotinidase deficiency can be treated with daily biotin supplements. Prompt treatment can result in normal development and prevent neurological damage in affected individuals.

**Drug Response**: Biotin supplementation is the standard treatment for biotinidase deficiency.
