#Analysis of Gene SRGAP3

##Background
Gene SRGAP3 (Slit-Robo Rho GTPase Activating Protein 3) is located on chromosome 3q23. SRGAP3 gene encodes a protein that belongs to SRGAP subfamily of Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP). It contains  1218 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 137 kDa. 

##Function for gene
SRGAP3 is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. It also helps in the development of dendritic spines in neurons.
