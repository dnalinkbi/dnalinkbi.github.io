# SGCA Gene Information

## Gene Function
The SGCA gene encodes a protein called sarcoglycan alpha, which is a part of a complex of proteins that play a crucial role in muscle structure and function. Specifically, sarcoglycan alpha is part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, which helps anchor muscle fibers to surrounding tissues and prevents damage during muscle contractions.

## Gene Information
- External IDs: SGCA, sarcoglycan alpha, SGCAR, SGC1A
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q21.33
- Alias: LGMDR5, Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, type 2D

- HGNC: HGNC:10856
- NCBI Entrez: 6442
- Ensembl: ENSG00000141510

## AA Mutation List
There are various mutations reported in the SGCA gene and some of them are:
- p.Gly189Alafs*43
- p.Arg77Ter
- p.Asp266Gly
- p.Ala172Val
- p.Asp255del
- p.Gly301Asp

## Mutation Type
There are different types of mutations reported in SGCA gene like frameshift, nonsense, missense, and deletion mutations.

## dbSNP IDs
Some of the dbSNP IDs associated with the mutations are:
- rs121908628
- rs199476130
- rs796052799
- rs1553468111

No somatic SNVs/InDels are reported in SGCA gene.

## Related Disease
- Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D (LGMD2D)
- Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive type 5 (LGMDR5)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management for LGMD2D is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help to maintain muscle strength and mobility. Corticosteroids may be beneficial for some patients. There is currently no cure for LGMD2D.

## Drug Response
No drug response information is available.
