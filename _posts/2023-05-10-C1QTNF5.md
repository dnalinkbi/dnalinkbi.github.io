# Gene Information

## Gene symbol: C1QTNF5
## Genomic position: Chromosome 11q13.1 

## Function
C1QTNF5 is a gene that encodes a protein known as C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 5, also known as globular C1q receptor (gC1qR). This protein is involved in various biological processes such as the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and systemic inflammation. It also plays an important role in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells in the eye.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the C1QTNF5 gene have been associated with various inherited retinal disorders such as late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD) and early-onset retinal degeneration (EORD) in humans.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment available for inherited retinal disorders caused by C1QTNF5 mutations. Treatments aim to manage symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. The prognosis for individuals with these disorders varies and depends on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
The drug response for inherited retinal disorders caused by C1QTNF5 mutations is not well understood. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of potential therapeutics.
