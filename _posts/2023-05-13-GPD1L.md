### Information on Gene GPD1L

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 3: 14,805,374-14,821,746

**Pathology:** GPD1L gene has been associated with a few diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

**Function:** The GPD1L gene encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like protein which is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and lipid synthesis.
