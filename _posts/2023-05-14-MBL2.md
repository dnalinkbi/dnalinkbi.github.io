# Gene MBL2

## Information
- The MBL2 gene is located on chromosome 10 in human genetic position 10q21.1 
- Pathology: Mutations in the MBL2 gene can lead to a deficiency in the production of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which is an important component of innate immunity against pathogens.
- Function: The MBL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mannose-binding lectin, which plays a role in the immune system by binding to and clearing away bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. 

## External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC:6829, NCBI Entrez: 4153, Ensembl: ENSG00000187098, OMIM: 614372, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11226
- Aliases: COLEC1, HSMBPC, MBL, MBL2D, MBP, MBP1

## Mutation Information
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - The most common mutation in MBL2 is the "O" allele, which results in decreased production of mannose-binding lectin. (rs7096206)
    - Other mutations in MBL2 include:
        - A/D allele (rs1800450) which results in decreased binding activity
        - B allele (rs1800451) which results in a complete deficiency of mannose-binding lectin.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported

## Related Disease
- MBL2 deficiency can result in an increased risk of infections, particularly in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for MBL2 deficiency, but individuals with frequent infections may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics.
- The prognosis for individuals with MBL2 deficiency is generally good with appropriate management.

## Drug Response
- Studies suggest that MBL2 deficiency may be associated with an increased response to certain vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine.
