## Gene Information

**Gene:** SMARCE1

**Function:** SMARCE1 is a subunit of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in gene regulation by modulating chromatin accessibility. SMARCE1 specifically plays a role in controlling gene expression during development, differentiation, and proliferation.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 11187
- NCBI Entrez: 6605
- Ensembl: ENSG00000123080
- OMIM: 603111
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q969G3

**Aliases:** BAF57, SNF57, CRACC7, ABF2, SME1, PMSC

## Genetic Position

SMARCE1 is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 at position 11.2.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

SMARCE1 has been reported to have somatic SNVs/InDels with their corresponding dbSNP ID. However, no specific information on the SNVs/InDels is available.

## Related Disease

**Disease:** Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS)

**Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant

**Symptoms:** Growth deficiency, developmental delay, intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, abnormal fifth fingers and toes, and other anomalies.

**Cause:** SMARCE1 pathogenic variants have been identified in individuals with CSS.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment option available for individuals with SMARCE1-related Coffin-Siris Syndrome. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and complications associated with CSS.
