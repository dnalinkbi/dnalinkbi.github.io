# Gene EIF4G1

## Genetic Position  

- Chromosome : 3  
- Location: p21.2 
- Strand: Plus

## Pathology  

EIF4G1 is associated with several diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

## Function 

EIF4G1 encodes eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (eIF4G1) which is a component of the eIF4F complex and plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis.
