## Gene ABL1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 9q34.1

**Function:** The ABL1 gene encodes a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, which plays a key role in regulating cell growth, differentiation and survival. It is involved in signaling pathways that promote cell adhesion and migration, and it is required for the normal development and function of several tissues, including the immune system and nervous system.

- c.3191G>A [(D1064N); rs121913530]

**Related Diseases:** ABL1 gene mutations are associated with several types of cancer, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and some solid tumors, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

**Treatment and Prognosis:** ABL1 inhibitors, such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, are commonly used to treat CML and some types of ALL. Patients with ABL1 mutations have varying treatment responses and prognoses depending on the specific mutation and disease context.

**Drug Response:** ABL1 inhibitors are generally effective in treating CML and ALL patients with ABL1 mutations, although some mutations may confer resistance to these drugs.
