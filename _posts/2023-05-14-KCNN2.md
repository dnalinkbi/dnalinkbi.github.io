## Gene KCNN2

- **Function for gene**: The KCNN2 gene codes for a protein that belongs to the small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channel family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
  - c.854G>A (p.Arg285Gln) - rs2229714
  - c.1627G>A (p.Ser543Asn) - rs3093105
  - c.1204A>G (p.Ile402Val) - rs3780411

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Currently no somatic mutations have been reported for the KCNN2 gene

- **Related disease**: 
  - Epilepsy, Idiopathic Generalized 10 (EIG10) - Mutation in KCNN2 has been associated with EIG10, which is an inherited form of epilepsy characterized by recurrent seizures without an identifiable cause.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: The treatment of EIG10 usually involves the use of antiepileptic medications, and the prognosis is generally good with proper treatment.

- **Drug response**: The KCNN2 gene is not currently known to be directly targeted by any drugs, but studies suggest that activation of this gene may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of epilepsy.
