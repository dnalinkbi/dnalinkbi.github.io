# Gene CACNG3

## Genetic Position and Pathology

* Chromosome: 16
* Start Position: 29,284,200 bp
* End Position: 29,686,002 bp
* Pathology: The mutation or dysfunction of CACNG3 gene associated with neurological disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy.

## Function

The CACNG3 gene encodes the gamma-3 subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel, which is expressed in the brain and involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for CACNG3.

## Related Disease

* Schizophrenia: rs2075882 and rs11572225 polymorphisms of CACNG3 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia.
* Bipolar Disorder: CACNG3 has been suggested as a candidate gene for bipolar disorder.
* Epilepsy: CACNG3 mutations have been associated with idiopathic epilepsy.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for CACNG3 gene mutations/dysfunction. Treatment for related diseases is symptomatic and may include therapy and medication.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug response associated with CACNG3 gene mutations/dysfunction.
