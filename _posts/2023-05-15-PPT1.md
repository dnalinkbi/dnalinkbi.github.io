# Information about PPT1 gene

## Genetic Position
* The PPT1 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p32.2.

## Pathology
* Mutations in the PPT1 gene cause infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis also known as CLN1 disease.
* CLN1 disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the nervous system, leading to progressive cognitive and motor decline.
* The disease is characterized by the accumulation of lipopigments in various tissues including the brain, retina, and skin.
* Symptoms usually begin in infancy with rapid onset of developmental delay, vision loss, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.

## Function
* The PPT1 gene encodes an enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 which plays a role in the degradation of cellular proteins.
* PPT1 enzyme helps in the removal of long-chain fatty acids that have attached to lysine residues in proteins through a process called palmitoylation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
* Not reported

## Related Disease
* Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis also known as CLN1 disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
* Currently, there is no cure for CLN1 disease, and treatment is mainly symptomatic.
* Patients with CLN1 disease often face a shortened lifespan due to the progressive nature of the disease.

## Drug Response
* There have been no drugs approved for the treatment of CLN1 disease, only symptomatic therapies used in most cases.
