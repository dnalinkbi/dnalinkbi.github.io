# Information about Gene DKC1

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
The DKC1 (Dyskerin Pseudouridine Synthase 1) gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and encodes the protein dyskerin. Mutations in DKC1 are associated with X-linked recessive dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin pigmentation changes, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia. Dyskerin is involved in the process of ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, and telomere maintenance, suggesting its important role in cell growth and proliferation.

## Function for Gene
Dyskerin is involved in the formation of pseudouridine (ψ) in ribosomal RNA and spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA). This activity is critical for ribosome assembly, precursor mRNA splicing and for ensuring ribosomal RNA stability and RNA telomerase activity.

## Related Disease
- Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of DC is generally based on symptom management and supportive therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used for severe cases with bone marrow failure. Prognosis varies widely, with some people with DC living into adulthood with normal lifespan, while others may have a reduced lifespan.

## Drug Response
No specific drugs have been approved for the treatment of DC, however, iron chelation therapy and antibiotics may be used in some cases.
