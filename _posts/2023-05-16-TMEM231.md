## Information on Gene TMEM231:

### Genetic Position:
- Gene: TMEM231
- Chromosome: 16
- Start position: 19,956,791 bp
- End position: 19,976,706 bp
- Strand: Negative

### Pathology:
- Mutations in TMEM231 gene have been associated with Meckel-Gruber Syndrome (MKS), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, encephalocele, and polydactyly.

### Function:
- The TMEM231 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is required for normal ciliogenesis.

### External IDs and Aliases: 
- HGNC ID: 28992
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 128338
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000168539
- OMIM ID: 613277
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9Y2D3
- Aliases: MKS2, FLJ12997

### AA Mutation list and type:
- p.Gln157* (stop gained) with dbSNP ID rs770252966
- p.Glu95Lys (missense) with dbSNP ID rs367543282

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- No somatic mutations have been reported so far.

### Related Disease:
- Meckel-Gruber Syndrome

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- There is no cure for Meckel-Gruber Syndrome and treatment is supportive, with a focus on individual symptoms and complications.
- The prognosis for individuals with Meckel-Gruber Syndrome is poor, as most affected pregnancies do not survive to term.

### Drug response:
- There is currently no specific drug available for treating Meckel-Gruber Syndrome.
