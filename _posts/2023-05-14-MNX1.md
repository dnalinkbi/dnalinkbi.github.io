# Information about Gene MNX1

## Genetic position
The MNX1 gene is located at the chromosomal region 7q36.

## Pathology
Mutations in the MNX1 gene are associated with several conditions, including Currarino Syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by anorectal malformations, sacral defects, and presacral masses.

## Function
The MNX1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays an essential role in the development of the spinal cord and the proper formation of motor neurons.
