## Information about gene F13B

### Genetic position 
The F13B gene is located on chromosome 1q31.3.

### Pathology 
Mutations in F13B can lead to Factor XIII B (FXIIIB) deficiency. This is a rare bleeding disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot properly.

### Function 
The F13B gene encodes the B subunit of coagulation factor XIII. This subunit is necessary for optimal transglutaminase activity of the factor.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations identified in F13B that can lead to Factor XIII B deficiency. The following are some of the mutations with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:
- c.281G>A (p.Trp94*) - rs121965007

- c.1245C>T (p.Gln415*) - rs763696896
- c.701G>A (p.Arg234Gln) - rs121965009

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels identified in F13B.

### Related disease
F13B mutations are associated with Factor XIII B deficiency. This is a rare bleeding disorder that can lead to both spontaneous and post-traumatic bleeding.

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Factor XIII B deficiency. Treatment involves the administration of clotting factor concentrates to prevent and treat bleeding episodes. With proper treatment, individuals with this disorder can lead relatively normal lives.

### Drug response
There is no specific drug response information available for Factor XIII B deficiency.
