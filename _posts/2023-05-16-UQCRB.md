## Gene Information
- Gene: UQCRB
- Pathology: UQCRB is associated with oxidative phosphorylation and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function, the formation of respiratory chain complexes, and ATP generation.
- Function: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex, which is critical in oxidative phosphorylation.
