# Gene MMACHC

## Information

The MMACHC gene is located on chromosome 1 at the genomic position 60983122-61005389 (GRCh38). It encodes a protein that is involved in the intracellular processing of cobalamin (vitamin B12).

## Function

The MMACHC gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the intracellular processing of cobalamin, which is needed for many essential cellular functions, including DNA synthesis and energy production. The protein encoded by this gene helps to convert cobalamin into its active form by catalyzing the formation of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin.

Aliases: Cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase, MMACHC, Cobalamin disorder CblC type, Cobalamin C deficiency, Cobalamin C type, Combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C, Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblC, Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblC, variant 1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some of the commonly known mutations that occur in the MMACHC gene are:

- p.R161Q (rs61753274)
- p.Y183C (rs61753275)
- c.271dupA (rs80230645)
- c.331C>T (rs61753276)
- c.567dupT (rs755659998)

These mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing cobalamin-related disorders, such as methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is no known association between somatic SNVs/InDels in the MMACHC gene and disease.

## Related disease

The mutations in the MMACHC gene are associated with a wide range of cobalamin-related disorders, collectively known as the cblC type. These disorders include methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, and neurological symptoms such as developmental delay and seizures.

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment for cobalamin-related disorders depends on the specific type and severity of the condition. In some cases, dietary supplements of vitamin B12 may be sufficient to manage the symptoms. However, more severe cases may require lifelong treatment with hydroxocobalamin injections to prevent complications.

## Drug response

Currently, there are no drugs available that specifically target the MMACHC gene or its protein product. However, patients with cobalamin-related disorders may benefit from treatment with vitamin B12 supplements or hydroxocobalamin injections, which can help to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.
