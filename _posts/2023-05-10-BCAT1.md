# Information about Gene BCAT1

## Genomic Location and External IDs
- Gene: BCAT1
- Genomic Location: 12q24.2
- Aliases: BCT1, BCT-1, BCAT, KAT2, BRN, PNAS-108

## Function
The BCAT1 gene encodes the cytosolic branched-chain aminotransferase enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of an amino group from a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) to α-ketoglutarate, generating corresponding branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate.

## Mutations and Related Diseases
- AA mutations: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BCAT1 have been identified, including: 
    - rs3741472 (V245I)
    - rs72554631 (R197L)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: Mutations in BCAT1 have been reported in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer. 
- Related Diseases: None associated with BCAT1 mutations have been reported so far. 

## Drug Response and Treatment Prognosis
- Drug response: There is limited information available on drug response with respect to BCAT1 mutations. 
- Treatment and prognosis: None specified as there are no known BCAT1 associated diseases.
