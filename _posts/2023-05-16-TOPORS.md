## Gene: TOPORS

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 9
- Genomic Position: 52,180,699 - 52,195,581
- Strand: minus

### Pathology 
Based on the literature, there is limited information on the direct association between TOPORS pathology and human disease. However, several studies have highlighted the potential importance of TOPORS protein in the regulation of different nuclear receptors, such as androgen receptor and estrogen receptor. Alterations in androgen receptor and estrogen receptor signaling have been linked to several types of cancer including breast cancer and prostate cancer. From this perspective, further studies on the role of TOPORS in the development of such types of cancers are necessary.

### Function 
The TOPORS gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed protein that contains an N-terminal RING-finger domain, a central ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), and C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). TOPORS protein has been described as an E3-ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of different proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. It has been implicated in the regulation of DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and cell growth and survival.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are several variants in the TOPORS gene recorded in dbSNP. Some of these variants are missense mutations that change the amino acids of the protein. For example:
    - p.Asp228Gly (rs139581017)
    - p.Gly439Arg (rs146834104)
    - p.Ser573Leu (rs201891171)
- Other variants are synonymous mutations that do not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. For example:
    - c.546C>T (rs186383733)
    - c.736G>A (rs149595701)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- According to COSMIC, there are somatic mutations in the TOPORS gene identified in different cancer types. For instance, there are four missense mutations (p.Ser1775Tyr, p.Lys622Glu, p.Glu1431Lys, and p.Ser506Arg) in breast cancer, and two missense mutations (p.Leu160Ser and p.Glu1090Gly) reported in lung cancer samples.

### Related Disease
- As mentioned earlier, the direct association between TOPORS pathology and human disease is limited. However, some studies have shown that TOPORS may play a role in the development of several types of cancer, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. In addition, mutations in the TOPORS gene may be associated with some neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment developed for TOPORS-related disorders or diseases.
- Studies regarding the correlation between TOPORS gene and cancer may uncover potential targets for cancer therapy.

### Drug response
- There is no current information regarding drug response to TOPORS in clinical practice.
