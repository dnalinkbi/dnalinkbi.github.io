### Gene: MAP3K20

#### Genetic Position:

MAP3K20 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 at the position 20q13.33.

#### Pathology:

MAP3K20 gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Alterations or mutations in this gene have been associated with several cancers, including colorectal, lung, and breast cancer.

#### Function:

MAP3K20 gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family, MAP kinase kinase kinase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in various cellular processes such as the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by activating the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways.

#### Related Disease:

Mutations or alterations in MAP3K20 gene have been associated with several cancers including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

#### Treatment and Prognosis:

Targeting MAP3K20 gene could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer. However, further research is required to identify safe and effective drugs targeting MAP3K20.

#### Drug Response:

Currently, there is no specific drug that targets MAP3K20. However, studies have shown that some anticancer drugs, such as Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and Cisplatin could partially target MAP3K20 signaling pathway.
