## Gene PMS2P3

### Genomic Location

PMS2P3 is a pseudogene, which is located on chromosome 7q11.23.

### Function

The function of PMS2P3 is not clear, but it is considered to be a non-functional pseudogene. Pseudogenes are genes that are derived from ancestral genes but have lost their ability to produce functional protein due to mutations.

### External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: HGNC:29222
- NCBI Entrez ID: 728068
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000229524
- OMIM ID: -
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: -

Aliases: PMS2CL, PMS2L9P

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Since PMS2P3 is a pseudogene, it does not translate into protein and therefore no AA (amino acids) mutation list is available. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID associated with PMS2P3.

### Related Disease

There is no disease associated with PMS2P3. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

Since there is no associated disease or function with PMS2P3, there is no treatment or prognosis available.

### Drug Response

There is no drug response associated with PMS2P3.
