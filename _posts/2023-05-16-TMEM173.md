# Analysis of Gene TMEM173

## Gene Information
- Gene Function: TMEM173 encodes for a transmembrane protein that is a key component of the innate immune response, functioning as a cytosolic DNA sensor which can trigger the activation of Type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
- External IDs: HGNC: 17754, NCBI Entrez: 340061, Ensembl: ENSG00000186847, OMIM: 610308, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86WV6
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 5p15.33
- Aliases: ERIS, MAVS-Related Protein, STING, Stimulator of Interferon Response CGAMP Interactor

## Genetic Variants
- AA Mutation List: The following amino acid mutations have been identified in the TMEM173 gene: K150E, V155M, P166L, V147L, S162R, R281Q, G230E, A232T, S240G.
- Mutation Type: Missense mutations
- dbSNP IDs: rs61737568, rs150312497, rs113176450, rs113176449, rs121434568, rs113176447, rs121434569, rs145441064, rs112101841

## Somatic Variants
- dbSNP IDs: rs3733476, rs13014505, rs76944851, rs147229773, rs137853465

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in TMEM173 have been linked to a number of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), and familial chilblain lupus (FCL).

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There are currently no known cures for diseases linked to TMEM173 mutations, although therapies aimed at suppressing the immune system can sometimes help to manage symptoms. Prognosis can vary depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- Studies have shown that targeting the STING pathway, which includes TMEM173, may be a promising avenue for the development of new treatments for autoimmune disorders.
