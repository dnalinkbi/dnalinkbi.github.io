# Gene: GAD2

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 10: 105,175,056-105,180,123
- **Pathology and Function:** The GAD2 gene encodes for the glutamate decarboxylase 2 enzyme, which is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. Dysregulation of GAD2 gene expression has been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia.
- **Function for Gene:** Catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA.
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
  - **HGNC:** 4172
  - **NCBI Entrez:** 2572
  - **Ensembl:** ENSG00000078604
  - **OMIM:** 138275
  - **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** O43787
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
  - R396W (missense) with dbSNP ID rs2298826
  - R263C (missense) with dbSNP ID rs11695881
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - None Reported
- **Related Disease:** Neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders associated with GAD2 gene dysregulation include antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder and individual response to treatment.
- **Drug Response:** Certain antipsychotic medications have been shown to improve symptoms of schizophrenia in individuals with GAD2 gene dysregulation.
