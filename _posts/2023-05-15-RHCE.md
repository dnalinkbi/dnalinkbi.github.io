##### Gene Information

Gene: RHCE

Function: The RHCE gene encodes protein(s) that are involved in the expression of Rh blood group antigens on the surface of erythrocytes.

External IDs: HGNC:10147, NCBI Entrez Gene: 6004, Ensembl: ENSG00000147056, OMIM: 111680, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08176

Aliases: RH, CD240D, RH30A, RH30B, RHCE1, RHCE2, RhCcEe, RHPI

Genomic Location: Chromosome 1q21.2

##### Mutations and Variations

AA Mutation List: The RHCE gene contains 10 exons. Several known mutations have been reported in this gene. Some examples of missense mutations in RHCE gene include: p.Leu68Pro, p.Pro100Leu, p.Val258Met, p.Lys311Gln, etc.

Mutation Type: Missense mutations

Additional variations reported in RHCE gene are SNPs. Some examples of SNPs include: rs807099, rs7941195, rs10980799, rs10844147, etc.

##### Related Disease

RHCE gene mutations have been linked to various blood disorders such as Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN), Rh incompatibility, and anemia.

##### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for the related disorders may involve blood transfusions and medications to manage the symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder.

##### Drug Response

The response to drugs that target Rh blood group antigens varies depending on the specific drug and the individual.
