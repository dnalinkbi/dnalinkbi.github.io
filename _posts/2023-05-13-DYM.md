# Gene DYM

## Genomic Position and External IDs
- Gene: DYM
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 18q21.33
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 3051
    - NCBI Entrez: 54830
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000141510
    - OMIM: 606347
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NRP7
- Aliases: 
    - DLYAR
    - ODGP

## Function
The DYM gene encodes for the protein Dymeclin. It is a multi-domain protein that plays a role in the development and maintenance of bones and teeth by regulating the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins.
