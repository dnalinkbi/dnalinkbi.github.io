# **Genetic Information Analysis of HPS3 Gene**

## **Introduction**
HPS3 gene is located on chromosome 3 (3q24) and encodes a protein called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 3 protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and lysosomal storage defects. 

## **Function**
The HPS3 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-2 (BLOC-2). BLOC-2 plays a crucial role in the formation of intracellular organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules.

## **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
There are no reported somatic mutations in the HPS3 gene.

## **Related disease**
Mutations in the HPS3 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 3 (HPS3), an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and lysosomal storage defects. 

## **Treatment and prognosis**
Currently, there is no cure for HPS3. Treatment is mainly focused on managing the symptoms including vision abnormalities, easy bruising, and bleeding.

## **Drug response**
There is no known drug response for HPS3.
