## Gene UCP2

UCP2 (Uncoupling protein 2) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 13.1 (11q13.1) in humans. It is a mitochondrial protein that plays a role in regulating the mitochondrial proton gradient and energy metabolism.

### Function
UCP2 is involved in the uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production. It is responsible for dissipating the proton gradient generated during the mitochondrial respiratory chain to generate heat. UCP2 may also play a role in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
