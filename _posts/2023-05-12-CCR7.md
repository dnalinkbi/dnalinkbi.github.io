# Gene CCR7

## Genetic Position
The gene CCR7 is located on chromosome 17 and its genomic coordinates are 34,027,344-34,035,598 bp (GRCh38.p13).

## Pathology and Function
CCR7 (Chemokine receptor type 7) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed on the surface of certain immune cells. It functions as a receptor for chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 which are involved in lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs. CCR7 is known to play a role in the immune response, specifically in the migration of dendritic cells and T cells to secondary lymphoid organs.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in the CCR7 gene with varying frequencies in different populations. Some of the non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and their corresponding amino acid changes are:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G12D | Missense | rs45563736 |
| A85V | Missense | rs2228462 |
| A159T | Missense | rs11575935 |
| H197R | Missense | rs1799864 |
| R226W | Missense | rs3136687 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported in the CCR7 gene in different types of cancer. Some of these mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- |
| Missense | rs201503465 |
| Nonsense | rs875989007 |
| Frameshift | rs28940283 |

## Related Disease
CCR7 has been implicated in several diseases, including autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer. Some of the diseases associated with CCR7 are:

- Breast cancer
- Lung cancer
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- Rheumatoid arthritis

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting CCR7 has been suggested as a potential strategy for cancer treatment. Inhibition of CCR7 has been shown to reduce cancer cell migration and invasion and slow down tumor growth in preclinical studies. However, more research is needed before it can be translated into clinical practice.

## Drug Response
Some drugs targeting CCR7 are currently being developed and tested, such as CCL21 fusion proteins and CCR7 monoclonal antibodies. However, their clinical efficacy and safety are yet to be determined.
