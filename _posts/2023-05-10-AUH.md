# Information about Gene AUH

## Genetic Position
The AUH gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 9 at position 22.2. Its genomic location is NC_000009.12.

## Pathology and Function for Gene
The AUH gene encodes the AU RNA-binding protein/enoyl-CoA hydratase protein, which plays a role in RNA metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Pathogenic mutations in the AUH gene have been associated with several diseases, including Hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic attacks, X-linked, type 2 (HIHG2), which is characterized by hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The following are some of the reported missense mutations in the AUH gene:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.A111T | Missense | rs121908656 |
| p.R130W | Missense | rs121908657 |
| p.G208R | Missense | rs121908658 |
| p.R267C | Missense | rs121908659 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the AUH gene.

## Related Diseases
Pathogenic variants in the AUH gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Hyperinsulinemic-Hypoglycemic Attacks, X-linked, Type 2 (HIHG2)

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of HIHG2 typically involves a high-carbohydrate diet and avoidance of fasting. Prognosis is usually good with appropriate treatment.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with pathogenic variants in the AUH gene.
