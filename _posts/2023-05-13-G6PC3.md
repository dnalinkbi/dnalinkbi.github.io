## Information about Gene G6PC3 

**Genetic Position and Genomic Location:** G6PC3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q21.31) and spans a region of approximately 23.6 kb.

**Pathology and Function:** The G6PC3 gene encodes an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3, which is a member of the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit family. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of glucose and catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and phosphate in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Mutations in G6PC3 gene are associated with severe congenital neutropenia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by a marked decrease in circulating neutrophil count with recurrent infections.

**Function for Gene:** The function of the G6PC3 gene is to provide instructions for making the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 that helps in the metabolism of glucose.

**Aliases:** G6PC3 gene is also known by several other names such as G6PT3, GSD1C, and G6PC4.

- NCBI Entrez: 92579 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109061
- OMIM: 611045
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NEM7

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** Mutations in the G6PC3 gene are associated with severe congenital neutropenia. Some of the AA mutation types with dbSNP ID are:
- R50C (rs61733190)
- A184P (rs878853768)
- R191Q (rs879255197)
- M1V (rs755991780)
- Y91C (rs147876890)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Somatic mutations in G6PC3 gene have not been reported yet.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the G6PC3 gene are associated with congenital neutropenia type 4, also known as severe congenital neutropenia.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for severe congenital neutropenia, and treatment mainly involves supportive care, such as antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy, to prevent and manage infections. The prognosis for severe congenital neutropenia varies depending on the severity of the condition and the age of onset.

**Drug Response:** Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) has shown promising results in treating patients with severe congenital neutropenia associated with G6PC3 mutations.
