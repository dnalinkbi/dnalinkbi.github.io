# Gene Information for FKBP5

## Gene Function
The FKBP5 gene encodes for the FK506 binding protein 5, a protein that is necessary for regulating the stress response pathway in the brain. It is involved in regulating the activity of glucocorticoid receptors, which play a role in regulating the body's response to stress.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels identified for the FKBP5 gene.

## Related Disease
Research has shown that the FKBP5 gene may be associated with a number of mental health conditions, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Inhibition of FKBP5 expression has been suggested as a potential treatment for depression and other mental health disorders that involve an overactive stress response pathway.

## Drug Response
There is evidence to suggest that variations in the FKBP5 gene may impact individual responses to certain psychiatric medications, including antidepressants and antipsychotics.
