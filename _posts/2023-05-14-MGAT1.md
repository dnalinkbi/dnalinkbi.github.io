# Information about gene MGAT1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 5
- Location: 5q13.3

## Pathology
- MGAT1 gene mutations have been associated with various diseases such as congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type IIa and type IIb, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and breast cancer.

## Function
- MGAT1 encodes for an enzyme called alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 2-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of N-glycans. N-glycans are important for proper folding, transport, and localization of glycoproteins. 

## IDs and Aliases
- Entrez Gene ID: 4246
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000113126
- HGNC ID: 7072
- OMIM ID: 601179
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q10469

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type
- p.Gly91Arg - missense mutation - rs117524725
- p.Asp472Asn - missense mutation - rs121918027
- p.Pro495Ser - missense mutation - rs727500857

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- c.532C>T - missense mutation - rs750251892
- c.769G>A - missense mutation - rs772528795
- c.930A>G - missense mutation - rs34144377

## Related Disease
- Congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIa (CDGIIa)
- Congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIb (CDGIIb)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Breast cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for CDGIIa and CDGIIb includes maintaining a healthy diet and monitoring symptoms. There is no cure for these disorders.
- Treatment options for HCC and breast cancer depend on the stage and type of cancer.
- Prognosis depends on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
- There are currently no drugs specifically targeting MGAT1 gene mutations.
