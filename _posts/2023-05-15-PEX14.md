# Information about Gene PEX14

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

### Genetic Position
PEX14 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.2).

### Pathology
Mutations or alterations in the PEX14 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including peroxisome biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy.

### Function
PEX14 encodes for a peroxisomal membrane protein that functions as a receptor for newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins. Additionally, PEX14 plays an important role in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes.
