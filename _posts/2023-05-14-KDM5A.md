# Information about Gene KDM5A

## Genetic Position
* Chromosome: 12
* Start position: 116,477,238 bp
* End position: 116,689,143 bp

## Pathology
The KDM5A gene has been associated with several types of cancers, including bladder, breast, colon, lung, and cervical cancer. The overexpression of this gene has been correlated with tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance.

## Function
KDM5A encodes a histone lysine demethylase that regulates gene expression and chromatin structure. KDM5A specifically removes methyl groups from the K4 residue of histone H3, resulting in the repression of gene transcription.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs have been reported in KDM5A for various cancer types, including:
* H46Y: Missense, rs1555223560
* S497R: Missense, rs1555260423
* V486G: Missense, rs768407787
* E66K: Missense, rs1555214442

## Related Disease
KDM5A has been implicated in various diseases and disorders, including:
* Cancer
* Autism spectrum disorder
* Intellectual disability
* Neurodevelopmental disorders

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no treatments available that specifically target KDM5A. However, the overexpression of KDM5A has been correlated with drug resistance, suggesting that targeting KDM5A could improve the efficacy of certain cancer therapies.

## Drug Response
Several drugs have been reported to target KDM5A, including JIB-04, CPI-455, and ASM-3. These drugs have shown promising results in reducing tumor growth in preclinical studies.
