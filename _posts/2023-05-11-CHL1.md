# Gene CHL1

* **Function for gene**: CHL1 (cell adhesion molecule L1-like) gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that is involved in neuronal development and is known to promote neurite outgrowth and axonal guidance.
* **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**:

* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Not available

* **Related disease**: CHL1 has been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

* **Treatment and prognosis**: There is currently no specific treatment protocol available for CHL1 associated diseases. However, therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CHL1 expression and/or function are being explored. The prognosis varies depending on the underlying condition and its severity.

* **Drug response**: Not available
