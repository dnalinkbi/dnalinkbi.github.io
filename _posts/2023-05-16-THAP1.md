# Information about Gene THAP1

## Genetic Position
The THAP1 gene is located on chromosome 8 at position 8q21.2.

## Pathology and Function
The THAP1 gene encodes a protein called THAP1 (Thanatos-associated protein domain-containing, apoptosis-associated protein 1), which acts as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and plays a role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels that have been identified in the THAP1 gene, including:
- c.310_317delCTGGGAGT (p.Ala104_Ala105del) rs864309574
- c.334C>T (p.Leu112Phe) rs80356688
- c.422C>G (p.Leu141Val) rs80356690
- c.526_528delCTT (p.Phe176del) rs864309573

## Related Disease
Mutations in the THAP1 gene are associated with Dystonia 6, early-onset (DYT6), which is a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for DYT6 dystonia, but treatments such as physical and occupational therapy, medication, and surgery can help manage symptoms. The prognosis for this disorder varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
Current research is investigating the use of botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation as potential treatments for DYT6 dystonia, but the effectiveness of these therapies varies among patients.
