# Information about Gene TPP1

## Genetic Position
The TPP1 gene is located on chromosome 11q14.2, spanning over 45.53 kb of genomic DNA.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TPP1 gene are associated with several diseases, including neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis types 2 (CLN2 disease), 12, and 14. CLN2 disease, also known as Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. Mutations in the TPP1 gene result in the abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin in the body, leading to progressive cognitive and motor decline, seizures, blindness, and early death. 

## Function for Gene
The TPP1 gene encodes the enzyme tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1), which belongs to the protease family. TPP1 enzyme plays a vital role in the lysosomal degradation of cellular waste and can break down peptides containing up to three amino acids.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several mutations in the TPP1 gene are associated with CLN2 disease. The following is a list of some of the most common mutations:
    - c.622C>T (p.Arg208Ter) - rs74315327
    - c.509_511del (p.Arg170del) - rs869320180
    - c.622G>C (p.Trp208Cys) - rs536722669
    - c.509_511dup (p.Arg170dup) - rs765948620
    - c.622G>T (p.Trp208Leu) - rs879255878
All of these mutations are associated with a loss of function of the TPP1 enzyme.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic variants in the TPP1 gene reported in dbSNP. However, they are not associated with any diseases or clinical outcomes.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the TPP1 gene are associated with several diseases, including:
    - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis types 2, 12, and 14

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for CLN2 disease, but various treatment options can slow down its progression. Enzyme replacement therapy, bone marrow transplantation, and gene therapy have shown promise in preclinical studies. However, clinical trials are still ongoing, and more research is needed. The prognosis for individuals with CLN2 disease is poor, with a life expectancy of around 8 to 12 years.

## Drug Response
Several drugs have been tested to treat CLN2 disease, including:
    - Cerliponase alfa 
    - Brineura
    - Lysotracker
    - Cilostazol
However, none of these drugs have shown significant benefits in clinical trials.
