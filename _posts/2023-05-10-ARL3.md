# Information about gene ARL3

## Genetic Position and Pathology
* The ARL3 gene is located on chromosome 10, specifically at the position 10q24.32.
* ARL3 mutations have been associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, and other symptoms.
* ARL3 mutations have also been associated with other disorders such as Leber congenital amaurosis, cone-rod dystrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa.

## Function
* The ARL3 gene encodes the ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 protein, which is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicular transport and protein trafficking.
* Specifically, ARL3 is involved in the transport of proteins from the Golgi to the ciliary membrane, which is important for the function of primary cilia.
