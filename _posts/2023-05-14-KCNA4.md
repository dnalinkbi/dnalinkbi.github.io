# Information about Gene KCNA4

## Genetic Position 
The KCNA4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q23.3) genomic position: NC_000011.10 (26500527..26522033, complement).

## Pathology 
The KCNA4 gene, also known as the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 4, encodes a protein that is a voltage-gated potassium ion channel and plays a crucial role in repolarization of cardiac myocytes and neurons. Pathogenic variants in KCNA4 gene have been linked to a rare neurological disorder called Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN) which is characterized by  progressive cerebellar ataxia, hearing impairment, and narcolepsy.

## Function 
The KCNA4 gene encodes a protein that forms a voltage-gated potassium ion channel. This potassium channel plays a critical role in repolarization of cardiac myocytes and neurons, which is essential for normal action potential generation and propagation.

- c.148G > A (p.G50R) rs61754749
- c.718G > A (p.A240T) -

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no report of somatic SNVs/InDels in the KCNA4 gene.

## Related Disease
Pathogenic variants in KCNA4 gene have been linked to a rare neurological disorder called Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN) which is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, hearing impairment, and narcolepsy. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for ADCA-DN, however, the treatment is usually symptomatic and is based on the individualâ€™s health condition and symptoms. The likely prognosis for individuals with this rare neurological disorder generally depends on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is no report available about drug response in individuals with variations in the KCNA4 gene.
