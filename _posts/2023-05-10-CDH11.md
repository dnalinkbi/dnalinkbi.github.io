# Gene CDH11

## Genetic Position
The CDH11 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at position 22.1.

## Pathology
The CDH11 gene has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, osteoarthritis, and neural tube defects.

## Function
The CDH11 gene encodes for the cadherin-11 protein, which is involved in cell adhesion and migration. Cadherin-11 plays a crucial role in the formation of molecular complexes that allow the cells to form a tissue.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 1767
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 1009
- Ensembl: ENSG00000170558
- OMIM: 600023
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55289

The genomic location of the CDH11 gene is 16q22.1-q22.2.

The aliases for the CDH11 gene include:
- CAD11
- OB-CADHERIN
