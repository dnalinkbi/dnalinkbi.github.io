# Gene MLH3

## Genetic Position
The MLH3 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14 at position 14q24.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the MLH3 gene have been associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and endometrial cancer.

## Function
The MLH3 gene encodes for a DNA mismatch repair protein that is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. It plays a key role in post-replication mismatch repair, meiotic recombination, and DNA damage signaling and repair.

## Related Disease
- Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)
- Endometrial cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with mutations in the MLH3 gene have an increased risk of developing HNPCC and endometrial cancer. Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the stage and severity of the cancer.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information regarding drug response specific to MLH3 gene mutations.
