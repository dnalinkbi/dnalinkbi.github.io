## Gene Information

The MRPL3 gene encodes for the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L3 and is located on chromosome 3 (3q25.31). Mutations in this gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex IV deficiency and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Function

Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L3 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is responsible for the translation of mitochondrion-encoded proteins. The protein is a part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and interacts with other ribosomal proteins to form the active site of the ribosome.
