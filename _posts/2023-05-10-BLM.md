# Gene: BLM 

- Function: The BLM gene provides instructions for the synthesis of a protein that helps in DNA replication and cell division. This protein is involved in unwinding the DNA double helix and resolving unusual DNA structures to prevent DNA damage.

- Related disease: Mutations in the BLM gene have been linked to Bloom syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short stature, sun-sensitive rash, immunodeficiency, and an increased risk of cancer.

- Treatment and prognosis: There is no cure for Bloom syndrome. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and aims to prevent or manage complications associated with the disease. Patients are monitored for any signs of cancer and are advised to avoid exposure to sunlight.

- Drug response: None reported.
