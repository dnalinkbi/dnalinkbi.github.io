# Gene: TFAM

## Information
TFAM is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 10q21.2-q21.3. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and replication. 

### Function
The TFAM gene encodes mitochondrial transcription factor A, which is essential for mtDNA maintenance and regulation. It is involved in mitochondrial genome stabilization, mtDNA replication initiation, transcription of mtDNA genes, and the maintenance of mitochondrial nucleoids.
