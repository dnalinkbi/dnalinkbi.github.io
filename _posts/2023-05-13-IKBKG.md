## Information about gene IKBKG

### Genetic position
The IKBKG gene, also known as NEMO (NF-kappa-B essential modulator), is located on the X chromosome at Xq28. It spans about 40 kb and has 10 exons.

### Pathology
Mutations in the IKBKG gene can cause several diseases, including incontinentia pigmenti (IP), a rare X-linked dominant disorder that affects the skin, hair, teeth, and eyes. The IP phenotype results from the loss of function of IKBKG gene.

### Function for gene
The IKBKG gene encodes the IKBKG protein, which is a key regulator of the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. This pathway plays a crucial role in the immune response, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell survival.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported for the IKBKG gene, including p.R232C and p.R227X. These mutations are associated with IP and have been reported in multiple families. 

- p.R232C - rs80356522
- p.R227X - rs80356521

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported for IKBKG gene, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels).

### Related disease
The IKBKG gene is associated with the following diseases: 
- Incontinentia pigmenti (IP)

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for incontinentia pigmenti, but treatments can help manage the symptoms. Treatment is based on the specific symptoms and problems that each individual has. Prognosis varies depending on the extent of involvement of the skin, eyes, teeth, and other organs.

### Drug response
There is no specific drug developed that targets IKBKG. However, treatment is mainly symptomatic, and each symptom can be managed using specific medications.
