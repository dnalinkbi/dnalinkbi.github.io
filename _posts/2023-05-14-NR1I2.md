## Gene: NR1I2

### Genetic Position 
The gene NR1I2 is located on chromosome 3q13.33.

### Pathology 
Mutations in NR1I2 have been associated with several diseases, including hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and liver cancer.
 
### Function 
NR1I2 acts as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport in the liver and intestine. It plays a crucial role in drug clearance and response.

### Treatment and Prognosis 
Treatment options for diseases associated with NR1I2 mutations typically depend on the specific condition. In liver cancer, treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or liver transplantation.
 
### Drug Response 
NR1I2 plays an important role in drug metabolism and response. Certain medications may affect the activity of NR1I2, and variations in NR1I2 have been associated with altered drug response in some cases.
