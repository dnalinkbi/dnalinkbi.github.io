# Information about Gene EYA1

## Genetic Position
- EYA1 is located on chromosome 8q13.3.

## Pathology
- Mutations in EYA1 can lead to the development of branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, a rare inherited disorder affecting the ears, kidneys, and neck.

## Function
- EYA1 codes for a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of these organs.
- It is involved in regulating gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 3490
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 2138
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000180837
- OMIM ID: 601653
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O00167
- Aliases: BOR1, EAB1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.1348C>T (p.Pro450Leu) - rs61751901
- c.909C>T (p.Arg303*) - rs387906914
- c.1702C>T (p.Arg568*) - rs387906915
- c.2120G>A (p.Arg707His) - rs267607190

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for EYA1 in the COSMIC database.

## Related Disease
- BOR syndrome is the primary disease associated with mutations in EYA1.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for BOR syndrome is primarily supportive and includes management of hearing and renal impairment.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- Currently, there is no specific drug therapy available for BOR syndrome.
