## Gene: GAMT

- **Function:** GAMT encodes a protein called guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase which catalyzes the methylation of guanidinoacetate to creatine, in the final step of creatine synthesis pathway.

- **External IDs:** Gene ID: 2593, Genomic Location: Chromosome 19q13.3, Aliases: GATM

    - HGNC: HGNC:4161
    - NCBI Entrez: 2593
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105679
    - OMIM: 601240
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P50440

    - c.534C>T (p.Arg178Ter), rs137853157
    - c.947G>T (p.Gly316Cys), rs5030868
    - c.1019T>C (p.Leu340Pro), rs5030869

    - c.328C>T (p.Pro110Leu), rs200985616

- **Related Disease:** GAMT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in impaired creatine synthesis leading to intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment typically involves creatine supplementation and dietary modifications. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, individuals with GAMT deficiency have a better prognosis in terms of cognitive and neurological function.

- **Drug response:** Studies have shown that individuals with GAMT deficiency may have altered responses to certain drugs, such as antiepileptic medications.
