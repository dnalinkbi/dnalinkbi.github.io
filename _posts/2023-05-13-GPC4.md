# Information about Gene GPC4 

## Genetic Position
The gene GPC4 is located on the short arm of chromosome X(22,697,831-22,720,759).

## Pathology
Mutations in GPC4 gene have been associated with various disorders like Nail-patella syndrome, Dyslexia, and Abnormal Morphology of the Corpus Callosum.

## Function
GPC4 gene codes for a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan which is widely expressed during embryonic development and in adult organs.
