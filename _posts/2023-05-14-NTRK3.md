## Genetic Information Analysis for Gene NTRK3

### Gene Information:
- Function: This gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3 that is involved in nerve cell growth, differentiation, and survival.
- External IDs: HGNC:8031, NCBI Entrez: 4916, Ensembl:ENSG00000112531, OMIM:600210, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16288
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 15 at the long arm (15q25.3)


### Mutation Analysis:
- AA Mutation List:
    - p.G623R with dbSNP ID rs137853244
    - p.M641L with dbSNP ID rs121913527
- Mutation Type: Missense Mutation
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - c.2111G>A with dbSNP ID rs369591975
    - c.2115A>G with dbSNP ID rs201462442
- Related Diseases: Congenital fibrosarcoma, Infantile fibrosarcoma, Thyroid cancer, Colorectal cancer, Lung cancer, Acute myeloid leukemia
- Treatment and Prognosis: The treatment depends on the type of cancer and stage of the disease. Generally, surgery followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy is used. The prognosis for patients with NTRK3-related cancers is better compared to other cancers.
- Drug Response: Certain drugs such as TRK inhibitors targeting the NTRK fusion proteins have shown promising results in clinical trials for NTRK3-related cancers.
