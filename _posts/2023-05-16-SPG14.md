## Information about Gene SPG14

### Genetic Position
The SPG14 gene is located on chromosome 3q27.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SPG14 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which is a group of neurological disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity in the lower limbs.

### Function for Gene
The SPG14 gene encodes a protein called spastizin, which is involved in the trafficking of lysosomes and autophagosomes.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations in the SPG14 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the SPG14 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which is a group of neurological disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity in the lower limbs.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for HSP, but treatment can help manage symptoms. Physical therapy and exercise can help improve muscle function and mobility.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug therapy for HSP, but some drugs may be used to manage symptoms such as muscle stiffness and spasticity.
