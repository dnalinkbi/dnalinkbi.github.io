## Genetic Information Analysis for Gene NRCAM

### Gene Overview
- NRCAM stands for Neural cell adhesion molecule, which is a protein-coding gene.
- It is located on chromosome 7 in humans as per genomic position: GRCh38: Chr7: 131034028-132221753.
- The gene has various aliases including NCAM3, MGC12747, and Neuron-glia-CAM. 
- The primary function of this gene is to regulate cell adhesion, differentiation, and survival in neurons. It plays an essential role in the formation of neural circuits in the central and peripheral nervous system.
