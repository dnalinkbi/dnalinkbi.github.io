## Gene HLA-G

- **Function:** The HLA-G gene is involved in regulating the immune response during pregnancy and transplantation. It encodes for a protein that inhibits the activity of immune cells (such as T cells and natural killer cells) to prevent rejection of the fetus or transplanted tissue.

- **External IDs:**
  - Gene: HGNC:4988
  - Genomic location: Chr.6p21.3
  - Aliases: HLAG, MHC-G, HLA-6.0

    - p.Trp214Arg (rs123347949)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - There are 68 known SNPs listed in dbSNP for the HLA-G gene.
  - Examples include:
    - rs371194629
    - rs9659795
    - rs115557828

- **Related Disease:**
  - The HLA-G gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions, including:
    - Cancer
    - Autoimmune diseases
    - Reproductive disorders

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
  - The role of HLA-G in disease progression and response to treatment is still being studied.
  - Some research suggests that HLA-G expression may be a useful biomarker for predicting response to cancer immunotherapy.

- **Drug Response:**
  - There is limited information about drug response specifically related to HLA-G.
  - Studies have suggested that HLA-G expression may play a role in resistance to certain cancer therapies.
