# Genetic Information for Gene SLC6A4

## Gene Information
- **Function**: Solute carrier family 6, member 4 (SLC6A4), also known as serotonin transporter (SERT), is a protein that transports the neurotransmitter serotonin from synaptic spaces into presynaptic neurons.
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 6532
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 17q11.1-q12
    - Aliases: HTT, OCD1, SERT
- **External Sites**:
    - HGNC: 11005
    - NCBI Entrez: 6532
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000108576
    - OMIM: 182138
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P31645

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**:
    - p.Leu550Val (missense) - rs140700
    - p.Thr62Thr (silent) - rs2020933
    - p.Leu16Leu (silent) - rs1042173
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: none reported

## Related Diseases
- **Pathology**: Altered regulation of serotonin and SERT function have been implicated in numerous neurobiological and behavioral disorders including depression, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: Sertraline and fluoxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly prescribed for disorders related to SLC6A4 dysfunction including depression and anxiety disorders. The prognosis for individuals with SLC6A4-related disorders will vary depending on the severity of the disease.
- **Drug Response**: Drug response to SSRIs has been linked to variations in the SLC6A4 promoter region, where individuals with high transcriptional activity of the gene respond better to these medications.
