## Gene MCC information

MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer) is a gene located on chromosome 5q21.1. It is also known as MCC1, CCP1, and MCC-1. The gene spans 31,914 base pairs and contains 8 exons. 

### Function 

The MCC gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of the beta-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. MCC is also known to interact with microtubules and plays a role in mitosis.

### Related Disease 

The MCC gene is associated with several cancers, including colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancer. Mutations in the gene have been identified in sporadic colorectal tumors as well as in individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). 

### Treatment and Prognosis 

There is no specific treatment for MCC gene mutations. Treatment plans will vary depending on the specific cancer and its stage. The prognosis for individuals with MCC gene mutations will also depend on the type and stage of cancer. 

### Drug Response 

There is limited information on drug response specifically related to MCC gene mutations. However, the beta-catenin signaling pathway is a target for many anticancer drugs, and drugs targeting this pathway may be effective for individuals with MCC mutations.
