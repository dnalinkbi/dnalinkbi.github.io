# Gene NAB2

## Genetic Position
The gene NAB2 is located on chromosome 9q34.11.

## Pathology
NAB2 is involved in various types of tumors. The most common mutation found in NAB2 gene is a fusion with STAT6 gene which results in NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein. This fusion protein has been identified in several neoplasms, including solitary fibrous tumor, hemangiopericytoma, and meningeal hemangiopericytoma. 

## Function 
The NAB2 gene encodes a protein called NGFI-A Binding Protein 2, which belongs to the family of transcriptional repressors. It regulates gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors and suppressing their activity. NAB2 is involved in various cellular processes, such as development, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## Related disease
The NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein has been identified in several neoplasms, including solitary fibrous tumor, meningeal hemangiopericytoma, and hemangiopericytoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis depend on the type and stage of the neoplasm. Surgery is the primary treatment for most cases. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be used in some cases. The prognosis for patients with NAB2-STAT6 fusion-positive tumors is generally good, with a low recurrence rate.

## Drug response
There is no specific drug developed for tumors with NAB2-STAT6 fusion. However, some targeted therapies such as imatinib and sunitinib have been used in the treatment of hemangiopericytomas.
