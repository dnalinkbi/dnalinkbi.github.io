# Gene: PEX7 

## Genomic Position and Function

- **Genomic Position:** Chromosome 6: 139,152,221-139,165,979 
- **Function:** The PEX7 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in the import of proteins into peroxisomes, which are organelles responsible for lipid metabolism and oxidation of toxic compounds.

## External IDs and Aliases

- **HGNC ID:** 8851
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 5190
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000112679
- **OMIM ID:** 601757
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P28288
- **Aliases:** PTS2R, PBD4B, PXR1

## Known Mutations

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:** 
    - p.Gln256* (nonsense)
    - p.Val259Gly (missense)
    - p.Asn270Ser (missense)
    - p.Gln282His (missense)
    - p.Tyr293Cys (missense)
    - p.Ala330Pro (missense)
- **dbSNP ID:** rs267607198 (p.Val259Gly)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- **dbSNP ID:** None reported

## Related Disease

- **Disease:** Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum (PBD-ZSS)
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal Recessive
- **Symptoms:** Hypotonia, seizures, liver dysfunction, developmental delays, retinal degeneration, and hearing loss

## Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment:** There is no known cure for PBD-ZSS, but treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Liver and lung transplants may be necessary for patients with severe liver or respiratory dysfunction.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis for PBD-ZSS is poor, as affected individuals typically die within the first year of life. Some rare cases have been reported where individuals with less severe forms of the disorder survive into childhood or adulthood.

## Drug Response

- **Drug Response:** There is no specific drug therapy for PBD-ZSS, but treatments addressing liver or lung dysfunction may be indicated.
