    - HGNC: 30822
    - NCBI Entrez: 8291
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000100423
    - OMIM: 603009
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O75923
- Aliases:  

## Mutation Information
- AA Mutation List:
    - p.Gly365Valfs*25
    - p.Thr1108Met
    - p.Ala176Pro
- Mutation Type: 
    - Frameshift
    - Missense

## Related Disease
- Disease: Miyoshi Muscular Dystrophy 1
- Inheritance: Autosomal Recessive

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: No known cure exists for dysferlinopathy yet, but supportive treatments are helpful to improve mobility.
- Prognosis: The long-term outlook for individuals with dysferlinopathy is unclear; it is a chronic health condition that has a varying course of progression.

## Drug Response
- Currently, no pharmaceutical drugs have been developed that effectively treat dysferlinopathy.
