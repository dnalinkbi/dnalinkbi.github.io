Gene: SLCO1B3 

* Pathology: SLCO1B3 is a gene that codes for a solute carrier organic anion transporter protein. Mutations in this gene can result in an altered function of this transporter protein, which can lead to changes in the uptake and clearance of drugs and potentially result in adverse drug reactions.

* Function: The protein encoded by SLCO1B3 belongs to a family of transporters that facilitate the movement of substances across cell membranes. Specifically, this transporter protein facilitates the uptake of small molecules, including drugs and hormones, from the bloodstream into cells.

* AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - No common pathogenic mutations in SLCO1B3 listed in dbSNP.

* Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - No common somatic SNVs/InDels in SLCO1B3 listed in dbSNP.

* Related disease: 
    - Altered function of SLCO1B3 has been associated with an increased risk of liver injury and drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

* Treatment and prognosis:
    - Patients with an altered function of SLCO1B3 may require dose adjustments or drug substitution to avoid adverse drug reactions.

* Drug response:
    - SLCO1B3 plays a role in the uptake of many drugs, including statins and anticancer agents. An altered function of this protein can result in altered drug response and potential toxicity.
