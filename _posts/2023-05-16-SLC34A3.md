## Gene Information

**Gene:** SLC34A3

**Pathology:** Mutations in the SLC34A3 gene have been associated with different forms of diseases, including nephrolithiasis, autosomal recessive, and hearing loss.

**Function:** The SLC34A3 gene encodes a protein known as sodium-phosphate cotransporter 2c (NaPi-IIc), which is responsible for phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys, preventing loss of phosphate in the urine.

**External IDs and Aliases:** 
- HGNC: 10998
- NCBI Entrez: 128338
- Ensembl: ENSG00000134698
- OMIM: 606158
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N695 

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- c.851C>T: missense mutation (p.Arg284Trp) with dbSNP ID: rs121912666 
- c.1192G>A: nonsense mutation (p.Trp398*) with dbSNP ID: rs780674531 
- c.354delG: frameshift deletion (p.Leu119*) with dbSNP ID: rs369564748 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported yet for SLC34A3 gene.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the SLC34A3 gene have been associated with different forms of diseases including:
- Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (OMIM #241530)
- Nephrolithiasis, calcium oxalate (OMIM #259900)
- Deafness, autosomal recessive 50 (OMIM #612565)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Management of patients with mutations in the SLC34A3 gene typically consists of phosphate and calcitriol supplementation to prevent the development of osteomalacia or rickets. Treatment of nephrolithiasis includes dietary modifications, increased water intake, and sometimes medication. Prognosis depends on the severity of the phenotype and associated complications.

**Drug Response:** The response to treatment with phosphate and calcitriol supplementation can vary depending on the underlying genetic mutation and phenotype.
