# Analysis of Gene PPARA

## Introduction
PPARA is a protein-coding gene which is located on chromosome 22. This gene is mainly associated with fatty acid metabolism and lipid oxidation in the liver. In this analysis, we will explore the various aspects of PPARA gene including its function, genomic location, aliases, AA mutations, somatic SNVs/InDels, related diseases, treatment and prognosis, and drug response.

## Function for Gene
The PPARA gene encodes a nuclear receptor protein which regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. This gene is primarily expressed in tissues with high energy demand such as liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids in the liver. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis in the body.

## Related Disease
PPARA mutations have been associated with various metabolic disorders such as:
- Hyperlipoproteinemia type 2
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
- Dyslipidemia
- Obesity

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments available for PPARA gene mutations. However, management of associated metabolic disorders such as dietary modifications, exercise, and medication may improve the prognosis.

## Drug Response
Several drugs have been developed that target the PPARA receptor including fibrates and thiazolidinediones. These drugs are used to treat dyslipidemia, a condition of abnormal lipid levels in the blood.
