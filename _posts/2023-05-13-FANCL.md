# Information about Gene FANCL

## Genetic Position

The FANCL gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 15.1 (2q15.1).

## Pathology

Mutations in the FANCL gene have been linked to the development of Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, abnormally small head size, and an increased risk of cancer.

## Function for Gene

The FANCL gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in repairing DNA damage. This protein plays a crucial role in a cellular pathway known as the Fanconi anemia pathway.

## External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location

* External IDs: HGNC:35481, NCBI Entrez:55120, Ensembl:ENSG00000163345, OMIM:608111
* Aliases: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase FANCL, FAAP43, PHF9
* Genomic location: Chromosome 2, 2q15.1

## Mutation Information

* AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID: The FANCL gene has multiple missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations that have been reported in the literature and deposited in databases such as ClinVar and dbSNP. A list of AA mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs can be found at [[Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs1580441818#clinical-significance-tab-1].)
* Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Somatic mutations in the FANCL gene have been reported in various cancers, including breast cancer and gastric cancer. A list of somatic mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs can be found at [[Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs1134264624#clinical-significance-tab-2].)

## Related Disease

The FANCL gene is associated with the development of Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder. Mutations in the FANCL gene account for approximately 5% of all cases of Fanconi anemia.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for Fanconi anemia, and treatment is mainly supportive. This may include blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, and medications to manage infections. Individuals with Fanconi anemia have an increased risk of developing cancer, and regular cancer screening is often recommended.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on the drug response of individuals with mutations in the FANCL gene.
