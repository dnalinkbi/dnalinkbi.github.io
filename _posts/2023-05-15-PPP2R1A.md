# Information about gene PPP2R1A

## Genetic Position
PPP2R1A gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 19q13.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in PPP2R1A gene have been implicated in different types of cancers, including endometrial, ovarian, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Some studies have shown that PPP2R1A mutations are involved in the initiation and progression of these cancers, and can act as tumor suppressors.

## Function
PPP2R1A encodes for the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine protein phosphatase which regulates a variety of cellular processes, such as cell division, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair.

## Related Disease
PPP2R1A mutations have been associated with different types of cancer, including endometrial, ovarian, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
PPP2R1A mutations can affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, identifying these mutations can help determine the appropriate treatment strategy. Moreover, PPP2R1A mutations are associated with poor prognosis in some cancers, such as endometrial and breast cancer.

## Drug Response
Some studies have shown that PPP2R1A mutations can affect the response of cancer cells to specific drugs, such as paclitaxel, tamoxifen, and trastuzumab.
