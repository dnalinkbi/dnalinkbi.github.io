# Gene RHBDF2

![Gene RHBDF2]([Click](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=RHBDF2#expression))

## Information
**Pathology:** In recent studies, loss-of-function mutations in the RHBDF2 gene have been linked to tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC), a rare hereditary skin disease that predisposes to esophageal cancer.

**Function:** The RHBDF2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is part of the Rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases. RHBDF2 is involved in the regulation of EGFR signaling pathway by participating in the proteolytic cleavage of EGFR ligands. RHBDF2 is also involved in the processing of several other transmembrane proteins.

**Aliases:** Tox4, RNF83, TEB4, DDI1, DDI2

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 30331
- NCBI Entrez: 55209
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169805
- OMIM: 617191
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N370

## Mutations
**AA mutation list:** The most common mutation in RHBDF2 associated with TOC is Q156P. Other less common mutations have been identified such as R81W, D211Y, and W187R.

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q156P | Missense | rs387906894 |
| R81W | Missense | rs201691817 |
| D211Y | Missense | rs398123727 |
| W187R | Missense | Unknown |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** Currently, there is no reported somatic mutation in RHBDF2.

## Disease
**Related disease:** The RHBDF2 gene is linked to a rare hereditary skin disease known as tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC), which predisposes affected individuals to esophageal cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for TOC. Treatment typically involves frequent monitoring for the development of esophageal cancer, as well as preventative measures such as the screening of family members, regular endoscopy, and histological examination.

## Drug response
Currently, there is a lack of information on drug response and the potential for targeted therapy for individuals with RHBDF2 mutations.
