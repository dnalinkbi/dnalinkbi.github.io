# **Information about Gene ORC6**

## **Genetic Position**
ORC6 (Origin Recognition Complex Subunit 6) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at position 16q12.1.

## **Function for Gene**
The ORC6 gene encodes ORC6 protein, which is a component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) involved in DNA replication initiation. ORC recognizes specific DNA sequences that act as origin sites for the initiation of DNA replication. ORC6 plays a crucial role in the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) and acts as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of other components.

## **External IDs and Aliases**
- HGNC: 8465
- NCBI Entrez: 23594
- Ensembl: ENSG00000159300
- OMIM: 609109
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5N6
- Aliases: ORC6L, HsORC6, DKFZp564A157

## **AA Mutation and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**
There are several amino acid mutations reported for the ORC6 gene, along with their respective mutation types and dbSNP IDs. A few examples are given below:
- c.317G>A (p.Gly106Asp) - missense mutation, rs34102860
- c.229C>T (p.Arg77Ter) - nonsense mutation, rs371119544
- c.784C>T (p.Arg262Cys) - missense mutation, rs150841263

## **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
There are several somatic mutations reported for the ORC6 gene, along with their respective dbSNP IDs. A few examples are given below:
- rs1571996672 - G>A transition in intron 1
- rs767857646 - C>T transition in intron 10
- rs1447138090 - G>A transition in intron 4

## **Related Disease**
The abnormal expression of ORC6 protein has been linked to the development of several types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer.

## **Treatment and Prognosis**
Further research is required to determine the precise role of ORC6 in cancer development and its potential as a therapeutic target. Currently, there are no specific treatments available that target ORC6.

## **Drug Response**
There are no drugs available that target the ORC6 protein specifically. However, some chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin and gemcitabine, target DNA replication and transcription processes and hence might affect the function of ORC6 protein.
