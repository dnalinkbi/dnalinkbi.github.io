# Gene DMGDH

## Genetic Position and Pathology

DMGDH, or Dimethylglycine Dehydrogenase, is a gene located on chromosome 6p21.2. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency. This disorder is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures due to the accumulation of dimethylglycine in the blood and urine.

## Function for Gene

The DMGDH gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of dimethylglycine to sarcosine. Sarcosine is an important intermediate in the metabolism of choline and methionine. The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney.

## External IDs and Aliases

External IDs for DMGDH include:
- HGNC: 28819
- NCBI Entrez: 29954
- Ensembl: ENSG00000131870
- OMIM: 605850
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H3M5

Aliases for DMGDH include:
- DMGDHL1
- FLJ16447

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

The DMGDH gene has several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variants reported in the dbSNP database. These include missense mutations, synonymous mutations, and non-coding mutations. Some of the reported missense mutations and their dbSNP IDs include:
- p.Ser662Pro (rs146972585)
- p.Asp562Asn (rs150150858)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There do not seem to be any reported somatic SNVs/inDels for DMGDH.

## Related Disease

As previously mentioned, mutations in DMGDH have been associated with dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency. Some other diseases that have been associated with DMGDH include:
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Glioma
- Renal cell carcinoma

## Treatment and Prognosis

Unfortunately, there is no cure for DMGDH deficiency at this time. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive and often involves a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The prognosis for individuals with DMGDH deficiency can vary significantly depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response specific to DMGDH deficiency.
