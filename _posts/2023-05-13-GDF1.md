## Information about Gene GDF1

### Genetic Position
The GDF1 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.11.

### Pathology
Mutations in the GDF1 gene are associated with a range of cardiovascular and craniofacial abnormalities, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, aortic valve anomalies, and hypertelorism.

### Function for gene
The GDF1 gene encodes for a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of proteins that regulate various developmental processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
