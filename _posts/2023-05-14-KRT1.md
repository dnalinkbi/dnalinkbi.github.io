# Gene: KRT1
## Genetic Position
The KRT1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 at position 11.2.

## Function
The KRT1 gene encodes for a type II cytokeratin, which is a protein that forms intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. Specifically, KRT1 is expressed in the outermost layer of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, where it plays a critical role in the barrier function of the skin.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are multiple somatic mutations identified in KRT1, with dbSNP IDs ranging from rs1048943518 to rs775582418.

## Related Disease
KRT1 mutations have been linked to several skin disorders, including bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (BCIE), ichthyosis with confetti, and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of KRT1-associated skin disorders often involves a combination of topical moisturizers and keratolytic agents. There is currently no cure for these disorders, and treatment focuses on symptom relief and prevention of complications.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response specific to KRT1 mutations.
