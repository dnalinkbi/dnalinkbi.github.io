## Gene: NRXN2

### Information
- **Genetic Position:** 11q13.1
- **Pathology:** NRXN2 is associated with cognitive and behavioral disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.
- **Function:** NRXN2 encodes a presynaptic membrane protein that belongs to the neurexin family. It plays a role in synaptic function, and its disruption can lead to cognitive and behavioral defects.

### IDs and Aliases
- **Gene ID:** HGNC:7984
- **Genomic Location:** NC_000011.10 (53453863..55063309)
- **Aliases:** Neurexin-2, neurexin-2-beta
