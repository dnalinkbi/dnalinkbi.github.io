# Information about gene HSPB1

## Genetic position
Gene HSPB1, also known as Heat shock protein beta-1, is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 at position 11.23 (7p11.23).

## Pathology
Mutations in the HSPB1 gene have been associated with various diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), and inclusion body myopathy (IBM).

## Function
The HSPB1 gene encodes the heat shock protein beta-1, which is a member of the small heat shock protein family. This protein acts as a molecular chaperone and it helps maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing protein aggregation and stabilizing other proteins.

- c.334C>T (rs155446530) in melanoma

## Related disease
Mutations in the HSPB1 gene have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, distal hereditary motor neuropathy, and inclusion body myopathy. Additionally, the HSPB1 protein has also been linked to various cancers.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with mutations in the HSPB1 gene varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation. Current treatments for CMT and dHMN are supportive and aim to alleviate symptoms. Inclusion body myopathy currently has no cure or effective treatment.

## Drug response
There is currently no targeted drug therapy for diseases associated with mutations in the HSPB1 gene.
