# Gene Information for SOD2

## Gene
- The SOD2 gene provides instructions for producing the protein manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD).

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: siebenkottenj 11392
- NCBI Entrez: 6648
- Ensembl: ENSG00000142168
- OMIM: 147460
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04179
- Genomic location: 6q25.3

## Gene Function
- MnSOD is an antioxidant enzyme that detoxifies reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during the electron transport chain. It is involved in the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.

## AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID
- p.Ala16Val, Missense, rs4880
- p.Pro127Arg, Missense, rs1799725

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.47G>A, rs114171998
- c.106T>C, rs28931578
- c.269C>A, rs121917786

## Related Disease
- SOD2 mutations have been associated with several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific disease and mutation.

## Drug Response
- There is some evidence that SOD2 mutations may affect drug response in cancer treatment.
