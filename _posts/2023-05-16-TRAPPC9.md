## Gene TRAPPC9

- Function: The TRAPPC9 gene encodes a subunit of the trafficking protein particle (TRAPP) complex, which is involved in protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It is also involved in autophagy pathways and has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.
