## Gene Information: DSCR8

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 21
- Location: 21q22.11

### Function
The DSCR8 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the biogenesis of microRNAs. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) and inhibiting its translation.

### External IDs and Aliases
