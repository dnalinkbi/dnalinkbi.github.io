# Gene DUX4

The DUX4 gene is located on chromosome 4q35.2 and produces double homeobox protein 4. It is mainly expressed in testis and in skeletal muscle cells, but its overexpression or misexpression can lead to myopathy and other diseases.

**Function**

The DUX4 protein acts as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression during early embryonic development. However, it has also been associated with muscle regeneration and degeneration, as well as with the immune response.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000257921
- OMIM: 606009

Aliases: DUX10, DUX4c, DUX4L3, DUX4L6, EC 2.7.11.1, HHs 243.1, bA425L10.1.

**AA mutation and dbSNP ID**

There are several variants of the DUX4 protein that have been reported in different tissues and diseases. Here is a list of some AA mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- R81Q - rs372952347
- T201P - rs893030845
- E216G - rs893030846

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

Some somatic mutations in the DUX4 gene have been associated with different types of cancer, including breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. Here are some examples of somatic SNVs/InDels with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- c.103C>T - rs754293440
- c.579G>A - rs1237669347
- c.1870A>C - rs778348384


**Related diseases**

Diseases associated with DUX4 gene overexpression or misregulation include:

- Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

**Treatment and prognosis**

There is currently no cure for FSHD or ALL, but different therapies are being tested to control the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease.

**Drug response**

There are no drugs specifically designed to target the DUX4 gene, but some drugs used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases may indirectly affect its expression.
