## Information about gene SMN1

### Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

- **Genetic Position:** SMN1 is located on chromosome 5q13.2.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in SMN1 gene are associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and causes weakness and wasting (atrophy) of these muscles.
- **Function:** SMN1 is involved in the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the survival and function of motor neurons. Motor neurons are nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. The SMN protein is important for the formation of a complex called the SMN complex, which is involved in the assembly of other proteins that play essential roles in motor neuron function.

### Gene Information

- **Function for Gene:** Production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein.
- **External IDs:** SMN1 gene has various external IDs like **HGNC:** 11181, **NCBI Entrez:** 6606, **Ensembl:** ENSG00000172057, **OMIM:** 600354, and **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q16637.
- **Aliases:** SMA, SMA1, SMA2, SMA3, SMA4, TDRD16A.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Variations in SMN1 gene can be many types like missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants. There are many mutations present in SMN1 gene some of them are as follows:

| AA Mutation (CDS) | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| p.Thr274Ile | Missense | rs760231029 |
| p.Glu134Gly | Missense | rs786204652 |
| p.Arg288Cys | Missense | rs267608781 |
| p.Lys32Glnfs*9 | Frameshift | rs267608791 |
| p.Gly183* | Nonsense | rs17138839 |
| p.Gly175Aspfs*23 | Frameshift | rs267608792 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

SMN1 gene is not commonly associated with somatic mutations.

### Related Disease

Mutations in SMN1 gene cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the muscles used for movement. SMA is classified into four types based on the age of onset and severity of symptoms.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for SMA, but treatment can manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment may include physical therapy, medications, and surgery. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease, but SMA can be a life-threatening condition in severe cases.

### Drug Response

Recently, a new drug called Nusinersen (Spinraza) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of SMA. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets SMN2 gene and increases the production of SMN protein, which helps improve motor neuron function.
