# Gene Information Analysis for WDR11

## Gene Position
- The WDR11 gene is located on Chromosome 10 at the position 10q26.13.

## Pathology
- There is a limited amount of information about the pathology of the WDR11 gene, but it has been linked to intellectual disability and developmental disorders. 
- Mutations and deletions in the gene have been identified in patients with severe intellectual disability, speech impairment, and motor delays.

## Function
- The WDR11 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.
- It is also involved in the development of the brain and nervous system.

## External IDs and Aliases 
- HGNC: 17720
- NCBI Entrez: 57757 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000183888  
- OMIM: 614202 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y2W7 
- Aliases: BIG2, TOY4, WDR15L

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several amino acid mutations reported in the WDR11 gene. Here are some examples:
   - R26W (rs121917872)
   - G279E (rs150399858)
   - R366W (rs138137955)
   - H411R (rs368853331)
- These mutations are missense mutations, which means that a single amino acid is changed in the protein sequence.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There is limited information about somatic mutations in the WDR11 gene. Tests can be performed using NGS (next-generation sequencing) or PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) to identify possible somatic mutations.

## Related Disease
- Mutations and deletions in the WDR11 gene have been identified in patients with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, and speech impairment. 
- WDR11 gene mutations have also been associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a genetic disorder characterized by growth delays, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure for developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and Cornelia de Lange Syndrome associated with WDR11 gene mutations. 
- Treatment is usually based on individual symptoms and can include rehabilitation therapy, medication, and special education.

## Drug Response
- Would need further research and testing to identify possible drug response for WDR11 mutations.
