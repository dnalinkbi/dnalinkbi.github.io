## Gene SDHAF1
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 19: 12839844-12856348 (-)
- **Pathology:** SDHAF1 encodes a protein that is essential for the flavination of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a mitochondrial enzyme complex that is involved in the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Defects in SDHAF1 have been linked to familial paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma, two rare types of neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the neural crest.
- **Function:** SDHAF1 is required for the covalent attachment of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor to the SDHA subunit of SDH, which is essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme complex. Loss-of-function mutations in SDHAF1 lead to a buildup of succinate and a decrease in fumarate levels, resulting in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and the activation of their downstream target genes.

    - c.65C>T (missense mutation) - rs1556556554
- **Related Disease:** Familial paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Surgery is the primary treatment for paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be used. The prognosis for these tumors depends on their size, location, and degree of malignancy.
- **Drug Response:** There is no standard chemotherapy regimen for paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, but some drugs that target the HIF signaling pathway, such as bevacizumab and pazopanib, have shown promise in clinical trials.
