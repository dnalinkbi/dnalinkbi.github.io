# Gene SCUBE2 Information

## Genetic Position
The gene SCUBE2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 at position 22q13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SCUBE2 gene have been associated with several types of cancer, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. In addition, some studies have suggested that SCUBE2 may play a role in cardiovascular disease.

## Function
The SCUBE2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in cell growth and differentiation, as well as angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels form.
