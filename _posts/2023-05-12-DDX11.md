# Genetic Information for Gene DDX11

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

**Genetic Position:** DDX11 is located on chromosome 12 (12p11.21).

**Pathology:** Mutations in the DDX11 gene have been linked to Warsaw Breakage Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in chromosome structure and function.

**Function:** DDX11 encodes for a DNA helicase protein that plays an important role in DNA replication and repair.
