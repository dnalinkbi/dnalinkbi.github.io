# Information about gene AICDA

## Genetic Position
The AICDA gene is located on chromosome 12q23.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in AICDA gene can lead to susceptibility to autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, including Hyper IgM syndrome type 2 (HIGM2) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

## Function
The AICDA gene encodes for activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which is an enzyme involved in somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes. These processes are important for generating diversity in the antibody repertoire of B cells, and for effective immune responses.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are numerous somatic SNVs/InDels of AICDA gene recorded, each with unique dbSNP ID. 

## Related Disease
Mutations in AICDA gene are related to the following disorders:
- Hyper IgM syndrome type 2 (HIGM2)
- Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for genetic mutations in AICDA gene. However, treatment may be provided based on symptom manifestation in affected individuals.

## Drug Response
No specific drug response related to AICDA gene has been reported so far.
