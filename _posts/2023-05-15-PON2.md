# Analysis of Gene PON2

## Gene Information

- **Gene Name:** PON2 (Paraoxonase 2)
- **Function:** PON2 is an antioxidant enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of lipids and detoxification of reactive oxygen species.
- **Aliases:** A-esterase 2, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 2, Gastrointestinal antioxidant, Gastrointestinal-associated antioxidant
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 7q21.3
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 9233
    - NCBI Entrez: 5445
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000106546
    - OMIM: 602409
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15165

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
    - c.311C>T (p.Ser104Leu) rs7493
    - c.-162-108T>A rs17847096
    - c.24C>T (p.Leu8=) rs11546498
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

## Pathology and Related Diseases
- Studies have linked PON2 gene polymorphisms with several diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Some studies have also described the role of PON2 in cancer progression and metastasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for PON2 gene mutations, however, studies suggest that modification of lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise could aid in the management of diseases associated with PON2 gene polymorphisms.

## Drug Response
- Studies have shown that statins such as Atorvastatin could potentially modulate PON2 activity and improve cardiovascular disease prognosis.
