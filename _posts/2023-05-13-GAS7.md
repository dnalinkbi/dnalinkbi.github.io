# GAS7 Gene Information

## Genetic Position
The GAS7 (growth arrest-specific 7) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q21.31).

## Pathology
Mutations in the GAS7 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.

## Function
The GAS7 gene encodes a member of the growth arrest-specific (GAS) family of proteins. This protein plays a role in regulating actin dynamics and is involved in neuronal development.
