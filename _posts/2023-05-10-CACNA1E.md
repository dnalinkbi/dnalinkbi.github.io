# Gene information for CACNA1E

## Genetic Position
- CACNA1E is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1q25.2. 

## Pathology
- Mutations in the CACNA1E gene are associated with various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and intellectual disability.

## Function
- The CACNA1E gene encodes for the alpha-1E subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel. These channels are involved in the regulation of calcium ion influx and nerve impulse transmission.
