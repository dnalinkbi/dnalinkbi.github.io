# Gene CIDEC

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 3, 47.44 - 47.47 Mb

- **Pathology**: CIDEC (cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C) gene plays a role in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. Mutations in this gene have been linked to various metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

- **Function**: CIDEC is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet formation, storage, and degradation in adipocytes. It also regulates apoptosis in non-adipocyte cells and plays a role in insulin sensitivity.

- **External IDs**:
    - HGNC: 18772
    - NCBI Entrez: 114882
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000163906
    - OMIM: 610370
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6P1M0

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:

| Protein Name | AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------| --------|
| CIDEC | p.Arg231Cys | Missense | rs267606915 |
| CIDEC | p.Thr77Ala | Missense | rs34707138 |
| CIDEC | p.Gly151Ser | Missense | rs180840509 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: No known somatic SNVs/InDels in CIDEC gene.

- **Related disease**: Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 5 (FPLD5/HMDD)

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Management of FPLD5 includes controlling the onset of metabolic complications by managing insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis.

- **Drug response**: No known drug targets for CIDEC gene.
