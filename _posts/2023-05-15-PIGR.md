# Information about gene PIGR

## 1. Genetic Position
The PIGR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q31.2.

## 2. Pathology
The PIGR gene is associated with Immunodeficiency 10 (IMD10), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent infections, inflammation and impaired antibody responses due to deficient or absent polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). 

## 3. Function
The PIGR gene encodes for polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) that is a protein that mediates transport of polymeric immunoglobulin molecule across the epithelium. PIGR aids in the transport of immunoglobulins into various body fluids, including saliva, tears, bile, and breast milk.
