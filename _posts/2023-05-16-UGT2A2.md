## Gene: UGT2A2

### Information:
- **Function for gene:** UGT2A2 encodes a member of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family of enzymes. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of a variety of environmental toxins and drugs.  
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location:** 
    - Gene ID: 55959
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 4q13.2
    - Aliases: UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2A2, UGT2A3, UGT2B16 
- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: HGNC:12578
    - NCBI Entrez: 55959
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000211705
    - OMIM: 606115
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95715
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Currently, there are no known amino acid mutations reported for UGT2A2 in dbSNP.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in dbSNP for UGT2A2.
- **Related disease:** Some studies have suggested a possible association between UGT2A2 genetic variations and the risk of developing metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. 
- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no specific treatment or prognosis associated with UGT2A2 genetic variations.
- **Drug response:** Some studies have suggested that UGT2A2 may play a role in determining the efficacy and toxicity of certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, anticancer agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
