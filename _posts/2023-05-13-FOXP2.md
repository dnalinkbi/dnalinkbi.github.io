## Gene FOXP2

**Genetic Position:** The FOXP2 gene is located on chromosome 7q31.

**Pathology:** Mutations in this gene have been associated with speech and language disorders such as developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) and specific language impairment (SLI).

**Function:** The FOXP2 gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of other genes. It plays a key role in the development and function of the neural circuits that underlie language and speech production.

- HGNC: 3827
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 93986
- Ensembl: ENSG00000186011
- OMIM: 605317
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15409

**Aliases:** CAGH44, SPCH1

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- R553H: Missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs61751492)
- R328X: Stop-gain mutation (dbSNP ID: rs121908239)
- A392T: Missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs145506904)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related Diseases:** Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), specific language impairment (SLI).

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for speech and language disorders associated with FOXP2 mutations. Treatment often involves speech therapy and other supportive measures. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disorder and the individual's response to therapy.

**Drug Response:** There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of speech and language disorders associated with FOXP2 mutations.
