## Gene information for MSH6

- **Function:** The MSH6 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA mismatch repair. It is involved in recognizing and repairing DNA base-pairing errors that occur during DNA replication.

- **External IDs:** HGNC: 7322, NCBI Entrez Gene: 2956, Ensembl: ENSG00000147162, OMIM: 600678, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P52701

- **Aliases:** GTBP, hMSH6, DNA mismatch repair protein Msh6

- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 2q31.1

- **AA mutation list:**
   - p.Arg215Trp (rs267607727)
   - p.Asp293Asn (rs267607730)
   - p.Gly390Val (rs267607731)
   - p.Thr553Ile (rs267607732)
   - p.Gly674Ser (rs267607734)

- **Mutation type and dbSNP ID:** Missense mutations with dbSNP IDs as mentioned in the AA mutation list.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic SNVs/InDels found in several cancers such as colorectal, endometrial, and gastric cancer. Some of the dbSNP IDs for somatic mutations in MSH6 are rs724728326, rs9267124, rs765101309.

- **Related Disease:** Germline mutations in MSH6 gene is associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome. Other related diseases include endometrial cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for MSH6-related cancers usually involves surgical removal of the cancer along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Prognosis depends on the stage and type of cancer, as well as the patient's age and overall health.

- **Drug response:** Studies have shown that MSH6-deficient cells can be more sensitive to certain chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin and temozolomide.
