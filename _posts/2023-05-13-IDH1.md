# Information about Gene IDH1


## Gene IDH1 information

Gene IDH1 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 2 in humans. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the isocitrate dehydrogenase family and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle. The alpha-ketoglutarate produced by IDH1 is used in various cellular processes, including amino acid synthesis and lipid metabolism.

## External IDs and aliases

- External IDs: HGNC:5383, NCBI Entrez:3417, Ensembl:ENSG00000138413, OMIM:147700, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:O75874.
- Aliases: HEL-S-48p, IDCD, IDH, IDP, PICD.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

IDH1 has been found to be frequently mutated in various types of cancers. The most common mutation is a substitution of arginine for histidine at position 132 (R132H). Other mutations include R132C, R132G, R132L, R132S, and R132V. The dbSNP ID for R132H mutation is rs11554137.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

In addition to the germline mutations, IDH1 has been found to have somatic mutations in various cancer types. The dbSNP IDs for some of the somatic mutations are:

- rs11554138 (R132C)
- rs200099296 (R132G)
- rs76909453 (R132L)
- rs201424153 (R132S)
- rs727504002 (R132V)

## Related diseases

Mutations in IDH1 have been found to be associated with several types of cancers, including:
- Glioma
- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Cholangiocarcinoma 
- Chondrosarcoma 
- Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
- Ollier disease 
- Maffucci syndrome 

## Treatment and prognosis

Mutations in IDH1 have been suggested to be an important diagnostic and prognostic marker in glioma and AML. IDH1 inhibitors, such as ivosidenib and enasidenib, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML patients with IDH1 mutations.

## Drug response

Ivosidenib and enasidenib have shown promising results in the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML patients with IDH1 mutations. They are small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1 that selectively target cancer cells while sparing normal cells.
