## Information about gene SFRP4

### Genetic position:

- Chromosome: 7
- Genomic coordinates: 76,225,600 - 76,238,506
- Strand: minus

### Pathology:

SFRP4 gene is involved in various types of cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. Studies show that the abnormal expression of SFRP4 gene promotes tumor growth by enhancing cancer cell proliferation and migration. 

### Function:

SFRP4 gene codes for a protein that regulates the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway plays a vital role in embryonic development and stem cell differentiation. It is also involved in tissue homeostasis and adult tissue regeneration. SFRP4 protein binds to Wnt ligands and prevents their interaction with Frizzled receptors, thus inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.

### External IDs and Aliases:

- HGNC ID: 11195
- NCBI Entrez ID: 6423
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000105869
- OMIM ID: 606595
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6FHJ7
- Alias: FRP-4, SARP-3, sFRP4, FRPHE, secreted frizzled related protein 4

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

No clinically relevant mutation has been identified in the SFRP4 gene until now. 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

Several somatic SNVs and InDels have been reported in the SFRP4 gene by the COSMIC database. Some of them are listed below: 

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| c.282C>A | Missense | rs1046311 |
| c.360C>G | Missense | rs2029915 |
| c.363C>T | Missense | rs34324219 |

### Related disease:

The abnormal expression of SFRP4 gene has been linked with various types of cancers such as:

- Breast cancer
- Lung cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Endometrial cancer

### Treatment and prognosis:

Studies show that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting SFRP4 protein can be a potential treatment strategy for cancer patients. However, more research is required to establish a safe and effective treatment protocol. The prognosis of cancer patients with abnormal SFRP4 expression depends on various factors such as the stage of cancer, the type of cancer, and the patient's overall health status. 

### Drug response:

Some studies have investigated the response of cancer cells to certain drugs after regulating SFRP4 expression. The results indicate that SFRP4 plays a crucial role in drug sensitivity and resistance. However, more research is required to establish a clear association between SFRP4 expression, drug response, and cancer prognosis.
