## Gene: SLC1A1

### Genetic Position:

SLC1A1 is located on chromosome 9q24.3.

### Pathology:

Variations in the SLC1A1 gene have been associated with multiple psychiatric disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.

### Function:

SLC1A1 codes for a protein that is responsible for transporting glutamate across the cell membrane. Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter involved in many brain functions including learning and memory.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:

- rs6454674: T/C, missense
- rs2251101: C/T, synonymous
- rs3780412: A/G, synonymous
- rs3780413: C/T, synonymous

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

- rs140155709: G/A, non-coding
- rs782260962: C/T, synonymous

### Related Disease:

Variations in SLC1A1 have been associated with multiple psychiatric disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.

### Treatment and Prognosis:

Treatment for psychiatric disorders associated with variations in SLC1A1 can involve a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and individual response to treatment.

### Drug Response:

Research has suggested that variations in SLC1A1 may be associated with differential response to certain psychiatric medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
