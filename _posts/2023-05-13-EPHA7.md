# Information about Gene EPHA7 

## Genetic Position:
Gene EPHA7 is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q16.1. It spans over 785.65 Kb and has 19 exons.

## Pathology:
Studies on gene EPHA7 associate it with several cancer types like colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. Mutations in EPHA7 are also reported in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder.

## Function:
The protein coded by gene EPHA7 belongs to the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family. This kinase receptor plays a crucial role in axon guidance and cell migration in the nervous system. It is involved in several developmental processes including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000137411
- OMIM ID: 604005
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P54756
- Aliases: HEK11, EHK3, EK11, EPHT3
- Chromosomal location: 6q16.1

## AA mutation list and mutation types with dbSNP ID:
There are multiple mutations reported in gene EPHA7. Few significant ones are:

| P305S | Missense variant | rs367793964 |
| R338* | Stop-gained | rs876657610 |

## Related Disease:
Few EPHA7 mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder. Many studies have reported that EPHA7 is overexpressed in several cancer types like melanoma, ovarian, and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
EPHA7 drug-targeting is studied in many cancer types, especially in melanoma. However, clinical trials are required to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. Currently, no targeted therapy is available for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with EPHA7 mutations.

## Drug Response:
Few studies have reported that the overexpression of EPHA7 is associated with resistance to several anticancer drugs. However, more research is needed to determine the exact drug response.
