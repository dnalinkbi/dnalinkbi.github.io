## Information about gene MT-TL1

### Genetic Position

- MT-TL1 belongs to the mitochondrial genome and is located at the position 3243.

### Pathology and Function

- MT-TL1 gene is responsible for encoding the transfer RNA (tRNA) responsible for carrying leucine amino acid to the mitochondria.
- A point mutation at position 3243 (m.3243A>G) of the gene can cause mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome.
- Other pathologies associated with the MT-TL1 gene include maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), Leigh syndrome, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO).

### External IDs and Aliases

- External IDs: HGNC: 7440, NCBI Entrez Gene: 4556, Ensembl: ENSG00000228253, OMIM: 590050, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P45381
- Aliases: MTTL1, TRNALeu

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- m.3243A>G mutation causes the substitution of leucine with arginine at the 22nd amino acid position.
- dbSNP ID: rs199476128

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for the MT-TL1 gene.

### Related Disease

- Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome
- Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD)
- Leigh syndrome
- Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no definitive cure for mitochondrial diseases like MELAS and MIDD.
- Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive, aimed at managing symptoms and preventing further complications.
- The prognosis for individuals with mitochondrial diseases can vary widely depending on the severity and progression of symptoms.

### Drug Response

- There is currently no specific drug approved for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.
- Some drugs like coenzyme Q10 and creatine have been studied for their potential therapeutic benefits in mitochondrial diseases, but their efficacy remains uncertain and requires further research.
