## Gene Information

### Gene Name: CACNA1S

### Function: 
The CACNA1S gene encodes for the alpha-1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel which is responsible for maintaining skeletal muscle function.

### Genomic Location:
The CACNA1S gene is located on chromosome 1q32.1 and spans a region of approximately 250 kb.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 1390
- NCBI Entrez: 779
- Ensembl: ENSG00000151067
- OMIM: 114208 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13698

- rs1475378740

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the CACNA1S gene have been associated with several disorders, including:
- Hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 1 (HOKPP1)
- Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility
- Central core disease of muscle
- Congenital myopathy with uniform type 1 fiber
- Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis of CACNA1S-associated disorders depend on the specific disease. In general, management of symptoms and preventing triggers is key to treatment. HOKPP1, for example, can be managed with potassium supplementation and avoiding certain medications that exacerbate symptoms. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility requires strict avoidance of triggering agents and monitoring during surgical procedures.

### Drug Response:
There is evidence that certain drugs, such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, interact with the L-type calcium channel encoded by the CACNA1S gene and may be effective in treating some related disorders.
