# Gene Information for SLC33A1

## Position
SLC33A1 is located on chromosome 3 at position 3q25.33.

## Pathology
Mutations in SLC33A1 have been associated with Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), a group of rare genetic disorders that affect glycosylation, the process by which sugars are added to proteins and lipids. Specific mutations in SLC33A1 can cause CDG type IIm, which is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and abnormal eye movements.

## Function
SLC33A1 is a transmembrane protein that functions as an acetyl-CoA transporter. It plays a critical role in the synthetic pathway of glycosphingolipids and other glycoconjugates.

## AA Mutations
Several AA mutations have been reported in SLC33A1 associated with CDG type IIm: 
- p.R126Q (rs786200983)
- p.K130N (rs386834008)
- p.L282V (rs758747236)

- p.Q418R (rs786204424)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for SLC33A1.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in SLC33A1 have been associated with Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) type IIm.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CDG, however, treatment is symptom-based and may involve physical therapy, anticonvulsants, hormone replacement therapy, and nutritional support. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response for mutations in SLC33A1 associated with CDG type IIm.
