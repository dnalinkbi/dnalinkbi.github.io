## Gene: SHROOM3

### Pathology:
SHROOM3 has been reported to exhibit tumor suppressive properties in humans. It plays a crucial role in the development of neural tube and skeletal muscle formation. Mutations in SHROOM3 gene have been associated with neuroepithelial defects leading to spinal defects. It has also been linked with advanced cancer stages, including colon and liver carcinogenesis.

### Function:
SHROOM3 is a cytoplasmic protein that regulates the shape of cells and tissues by controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

- c.934C>T: Missense mutation, rs760812479

### Related Disease:
- NTDs (Neural tube defects) 
- Liver cancer
- Colorectal cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, there is no specific treatment available to target SHROOM3. However, different studies are focused on developing targeted therapies to inhibit SHROOM3 for the treatment of cancer. It has been suggested that SHROOM3 expression could serve as an important biomarker for predicting cancer prognosis.

### Drug Response:
No drug responses have been recorded for SHROOM3 yet.
