## Information about Gene APOD

### Genetic Position
- APOD is located on Chromosome 3 in humans.
- The genomic coordinates of APOD are 3q29.

### Pathology
- Variations in the APOD gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

### Function
- APOD encodes a protein called Apolipoprotein D.
- Apolipoprotein D is involved in lipid metabolism and transport, and may also have neuroprotective functions.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location
- HGNC:400
- NCBI Entrez:347
- Ensembl:ENSG00000175218
- OMIM:107870
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P05090
- Aliases: APOD, ADTB2, APO-D

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.601T>C, p.Cys201Arg (rs72642644)
- c.451C>T, p.Leu151Phe (rs61754868)
- c.673C>A, p.Pro225His (rs28936382)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the APOD gene.

### Related Disease
- Alzheimer's Disease
- Parkinson's Disease
- Schizophrenia
- TBI-induced Alzheimer's Disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for disorders associated with APOD variations are limited, and primarily focus on managing symptoms. 
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response
- There is limited research on drug response specific to APOD variations.
