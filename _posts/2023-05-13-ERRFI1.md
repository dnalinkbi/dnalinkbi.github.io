# Information on gene ERRFI1

## Summary
The ERRFI1 gene encodes a protein called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor 1, which is involved in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The gene is located on chromosome 1p36.2, and its aliases include MIG6, RALT, and gene associated with metastasis-1 (GAM-1). 

## Function
The ERRFI1 protein is a negative regulator of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which plays a role in cell growth and differentiation. The protein acts as an adapter molecule, binding to and inhibiting the kinase activity of several upstream molecules in the pathway. It is involved in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, and has been implicated in several cancers.

|Type|dbSNP ID|
|-|-|
|Point mutation|rs878854911|
|Insertion|rs544185312|
|Deletion|rs543567405|

## Related diseases
The ERRFI1 gene has been implicated in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and gastric cancers. Its downregulation is associated with a poor prognosis and more aggressive tumor behavior.

## Treatment and prognosis
As the ERRFI1 gene is involved in cancer progression, it is a potential target for cancer therapy. Inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway have been developed and are being tested in clinical trials. The prognosis of patients with ERRFI1 mutations may depend on the specific type and location of the mutation and the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug response
Inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, such as MEK inhibitors, have shown promise in preclinical studies and clinical trials as a potential therapeutic option for cancers involving ERRFI1 mutations.
