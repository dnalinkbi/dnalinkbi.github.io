## Gene NMT2 information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome Xp22.2
- **Pathology**: Associated with X-linked intellectual disability
- **Function for gene:** Encodes a protein that catalyzes the N-myristoylation of glycine residues in a variety of proteins, which is important for proper cellular localization and function of the target proteins.
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 7856
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 56748
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000165906
    - OMIM: 300497
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NXR9
    - Aliases: NMT, GX628, GXM, hNMT2
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.361A>G (p.K121E) rs755622116
    - c.973A>G (p.M325V) rs113540076
    - c.418G>A (p.G140D) rs587784037
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - None reported
- **Related Disease:** X-linked intellectual disability
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** No cure is available for X-linked intellectual disability, but treatment typically involves individualized support and therapy to improve function and overall quality of life.
- **Drug Response:** No known drug response for NMT2.
