# Information about gene MIR146A

## Genetic position
The MIR146A gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p13.3).

## Pathology and function
The MIR146A gene encodes for miRNA-146a, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and inflammation. Dysregulation of miRNA-146a has been linked to various diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease.

## Gene information
- **Function:** miRNA-146a regulates immune responses and inflammation
- **External IDs:** HGNC:31553, NCBI EntrezGene:406938, Ensembl:ENSG00000205493, OMIM:610418, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q8IU78
- **Aliases:** MIRN146A, MIRN146, miRNA146A

## AA mutations
There are no reported amino acid mutations for miRNA-146a.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- rs2910164: This SNP is important as a potential risk factor for various cancers and autoimmune disorders. 
- rs57095329: This SNP is associated with the risk of developing gastric cancer.

## Related disease
Dysregulated miRNA-146a has been linked to various diseases such as:
- Cancer (breast, gastric, thyroid, pancreatic, etc.)
- Autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.)
- Cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, etc.)
- Inflammatory disorders (inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, etc.)

## Treatment and prognosis
Targeted therapies for miRNA-146a are still under investigation, but the use of miRNA antagonists and mimics shows promise. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and the extent of miRNA-146a dysregulation.

## Drug response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeting miRNA-146a.
