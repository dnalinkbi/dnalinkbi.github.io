### Gene Information: CYP1B1  
- **Function:**  
The CYP1B1 gene encodes an enzyme called cytochrome P4501B1, which is involved in the metabolism of various toxins and endogenous compounds in the human body. This gene plays a key role in the biosynthesis of estrogen and testosterone, as well as several other important biological processes, including detoxification of carcinogens, steroid hormone metabolism, and drug metabolism.

   - rs1056838: Ser464Thr
  
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**  
There are many somatic mutations in the CYP1B1 gene that have been identified in various cancer types such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer. Some of these include:  
   - rs185975172: Gln222Lys
   - rs200897559: Leu432Arg
   - rs181707868: Pro437Leu
   
- **Related Disease:**  
Mutations in the CYP1B1 gene are associated with several human diseases, such as primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), a rare eye disorder that affects infants. Other diseases include open-angle glaucoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and endometrial cancer.  

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**  
There is no known cure for PCG and treatments are only supportive. However, early diagnosis can improve the long-term prognosis of patients. For other diseases, treatment approaches vary depending on the type and stage of the disease.

- **Drug Response:**  
Polymorphisms in the CYP1B1 gene have been associated with variable drug responses and adverse drug reactions to various chemotherapeutic agents, such as tamoxifen and docetaxel.
