# Information about Gene C1S

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- Gene: C1S (Complement C1s subcomponent)
- Pathology: C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, Hereditary Angioedema
- Function: Activates complement component 4 (C4) by cleaving it into C4a and C4b, which are involved in the classical complement pathway.
