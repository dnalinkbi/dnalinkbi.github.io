# Gene SUV420H1

## Genetic Position

The SUV420H1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.1).

## Pathology

SUV420H1 is a histone methyltransferase that is involved in the formation of heterochromatin. Abnormalities in the function of this gene have been associated with the development of different types of cancer, such as lung cancer and breast cancer.

## Function

The SUV420H1 gene encodes for a protein that contributes to the formation of heterochromatin, a tightly-packed form of DNA that is associated with gene silencing. This process is important for the regulation of gene expression and plays a crucial role in many biological processes, such as development and differentiation.

## External IDs

Some external identifiers for the SUV420H1 gene and its genomic location include:

- HGNC ID: 11787
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 51176
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000073111
- OMIM ID: 609238
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9HCE1

Some aliases for this gene are:

- KMT5B
- HP1Hs-gamma
- G9a-like protein 2
