# Gene: OLR1

## Genetic Position 

- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12p13.2
- Strand: Plus

## Pathology

OLR1 gene is associated with various diseases including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. 

## Function

The OLR1 gene encodes for the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) receptor 1, which is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor. It plays an important role in the uptake of oxLDL and its degradation. Additionally, OLR1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, and angiogenesis.

## External IDs 

- Gene ID: 4973
- Genomic location: NC_000012.12 (4071531..4094242, complement)
- Other aliases: LOX1, CLEC8A, SCARE1, CD36L1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

No mutations have been reported as pathogenic for the OLR1 gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic mutations have been reported for the OLR1 gene.

## Related disease

The OLR1 gene is associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, including:

- Atherosclerosis
- Hypertension
- Alzheimer's disease
- Ischemic stroke

## Treatment and prognosis

There are currently no specific treatments targeting the OLR1 gene. However, therapeutic options that reduce the levels of its ligand, oxLDL, such as statins, may have a positive impact on the associated diseases.

## Drug response

There is limited information available on drug response related to the OLR1 gene.
