## Gene: CDKN1B

### Genomic Position:
CDKN1B is located on chromosome 12 at location 11.1-q11.2.

### Pathology:
CDKN1B mutations have been associated with several types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer.

### Function:
CDKN1B encodes for the protein p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which regulates the cell cycle. p27Kip1 prevents the progression of the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase activity.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 1785

- c.68C>T (p.Pro23Leu) - rs121912592
- c.449C>T (p.Arg150Ter) - rs121912590

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.376C>T (p.Thr126Met) - rs121912591
- c.385G>T (p.Gly129Cys) - rs121912589

### Related Disease:
- Breast cancer
- Lung cancer
- Prostate cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for CDKN1B-associated cancers vary depending on the cancer type, stage and other factors. Several therapies are used, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. The prognosis for CDKN1B-associated cancers depends on several factors, such as the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the grade, and the presence or absence of metastasis.

### Drug Response:
CDKN1B mutations have been associated with resistance to certain therapies, such as tamoxifen in breast cancer.
