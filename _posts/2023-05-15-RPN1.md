# Gene: RPN1

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 3 (3p21.31)
- **Pathology:** The RPN1 gene is associated with the development of multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Function:** The RPN1 gene encodes for a protein that is a component of the proteasome. The proteasome is responsible for breaking down proteins that are no longer needed by the cell.

## External IDs
- **HGNC:** 10257
- **NCBI Entrez Gene:** 6185
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000114758
- **OMIM:** 601491
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P04843

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- No known mutations for RPN1.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic variations reported for RPN1.

## Related disease
- Multiple myeloma
- Acute myeloid leukemia

## Treatment and prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis for multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia varies depending on the individual case. Chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy may be used.

## Drug response
- There have been no specific drugs targeting RPN1. However, patients with multiple myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia may receive chemotherapy, which can include proteasome inhibitors.
