## Information on Gene RANBP2

### Genetic Position:
Gene RANBP2 (Ran binding protein 2) is located at chromosome 2: 113,636,587 - 113,853,463 bp on the minus strand.

### Pathology:
RANBP2 mutations have been related to certain hematological malignancies like acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Function
RANBP2 is a protein-coding gene that encodes the Ran-binding protein 2, also known as Nup358. It plays a crucial role in completing the mitosis process.
