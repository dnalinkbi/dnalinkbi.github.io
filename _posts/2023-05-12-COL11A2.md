# Information About Gene COL11A2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
COL11A2 is a gene located on chromosome 6 at position 21.33. Mutations in the COL11A2 gene have been associated with several diseases such as Marshall syndrome, Stickler syndrome, and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. The function of the COL11A2 gene is to provide instructions for making a protein called type XI collagen, which is an essential component of various tissues such as cartilage, bone, and the inner ear.
