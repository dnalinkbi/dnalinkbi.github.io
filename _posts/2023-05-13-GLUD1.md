# Gene: GLUD1

Function: The GLUD1 gene encodes for the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate, producing NADH in the process.

Related disease: 
- Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, familial 6 - GLUD1 gene mutations have been linked to this disease, which is characterized by low blood sugar levels due to excessive insulin secretion.

Treatment and prognosis:
- Management of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia may involve medication, dietary changes, or surgery, depending on the severity of the condition.

Drug response:
- There is currently no known drug response associated with GLUD1 gene mutations.
