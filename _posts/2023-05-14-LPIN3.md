## Information about Gene LPIN3

**Genetic Position:** The LPIN3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q13.1.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the LPIN3 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

**Function:** The LPIN3 gene encodes a protein called lipin-3, which belongs to the family of lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatases. These proteins play a role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of triacylglycerols, which are important for energy storage.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
None reported.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the LPIN3 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no specific treatment for LPIN3-related metabolic disorders. The treatment is mainly focused on managing the symptoms of the disease, including weight loss and controlling blood sugar levels. The prognosis of these disorders varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

**Drug Response:** Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting LPIN3-related metabolic disorders.
