# Information on Gene LAMC2

## Gene Overview:
- **Gene Name:** LAMC2 (laminin subunit gamma 2)
- **Function:** Encodes the gamma 2 chain of laminin-5, an extracellular matrix protein that promotes adhesion and migration of cells. LAMC2 plays an important role in skin, kidney, and nervous system development and function. 
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 6503, NCBI Entrez: 3918, Ensembl: ENSG00000136153, OMIM: 150292, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55268
- **Aliases:** BM600, Epiligrin, LAMB2B

## Mutations:
- **AA Mutation List:** LAMC2 mutations are commonly associated with Herlitz Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (H-JEB). 
- **Mutation Type:** Missense, Nonsense, Frameshift, Splice, Insertion, Deletion, Duplication.
- **dbSNP ID:** rs555729878, rs555129130, rs528234015, rs387906819, rs372350196, rs25604, rs397514732, rs587776865, rs281864472, rs559415990, rs758407743, rs61321551, rs312262110, rs557669401, rs45349499, rs876658169, rs372620285, rs764674969

## Somatic Mutations:
- **dbSNP ID:** rs455139740, rs201144525, rs34198391, rs41286452, rs869025955, rs775579019, rs865056095

## Related Diseases:
- **Primary Disease:** Herlitz Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (H-JEB), a rare genetic skin disorder characterized by blistering of the skin and mucous membranes.
- **Other Associated Diseases:** Neural Tube Defects, Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA, Glaucoma, Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- There is currently no cure for Herlitz Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa. Treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and may include wound care, nutritional support, and physical therapy. 
- The prognosis for individuals with H-JEB is poor, with many dying during infancy or childhood due to the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response:
- Currently, there are no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of H-JEB. However, several approaches are under investigation, including cell therapy and gene editing.
