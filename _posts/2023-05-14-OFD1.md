# Gene OFD1

## Information
The OFD1 gene is located on chromosome Xq22. It spans a genomic region of 1,352,154 base pairs. The gene is also referred to as oral-facial-digital syndrome 1.

## Function
The OFD1 gene encodes a centrosomal/basal body protein that plays a key role in cilium formation, regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and cell cycle progression. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a spectrum of X-linked ciliopathies, including oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1), Joubert syndrome type 10 (JBTS10), and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2 (SGBS2).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the OFD1 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome Type 1
- Joubert Syndrome Type 10
- Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome Type 2

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for OFD1. Treatment is supportive and may include medications to control seizures, gastrostomy tube placement for feeding difficulties, and surgical interventions for skeletal and renal abnormalities.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of OFD1. However, some medications used to manage symptoms of the disease, such as antiepileptic drugs, may vary in effectiveness from person to person.
