## Information about Gene KCND2
### Genetic Position
The gene KCND2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31.31).
### Pathology
KCND2 mutations have been associated with several pathological conditions, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.
### Function for Gene
The KCND2 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that helps regulate the flow of potassium ions in and out of cells. This regulation is important for controlling the excitability of neurons and maintaining proper electrical signaling in the brain and other tissues.
