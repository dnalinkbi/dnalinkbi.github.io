## Gene RSPO4

### Genetic Position
* Chromosome: 20
* Genomic Position: 20q13.3

### Pathology
RSPO4 gene mutations have been associated with congenital heart diseases such as patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot.

### Function
RSPO4 is a member of the R-spondin family of proteins that act as ligands for the Wnt signaling pathway. It plays a vital role in embryonic development and tissue regeneration.

### External IDs and Aliases
* HGNC: 15938 
* NCBI Entrez: 728393 
* Ensembl: ENSG00000125845 
* OMIM: 610566 
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q2V1S5 
* Aliases: CXorf6, R-spondin-4, cysteine-rich and single PDZ domain-containing protein

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
* p.Asp64Gly: rs192582710
* p.Ala149Thr: rs768369657

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported for the RSPO4 gene.

### Related Disease
* Patent ductus arteriosus
* Tetralogy of Fallot

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot is primarily through surgical intervention. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in the RSPO4 gene varies based on the severity of the associated condition.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response related to mutations in the RSPO4 gene.
