# Gene: TBX20

### Genomic location and External IDs for gene
- Chromosome: 7
- Gene ID: 57057
- HGNC ID: 11575
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000105976
- NCBI Entrez ID: 57057
- Alias: T-box protein 20, TBX20, T-box transcription factor TBX20

### Function for gene
TBX20 gene encodes a member of the T-box transcription factor family that plays a key role in the development and maturation of cardiac structures. It regulates the expression of genes that are involved in cardiac morphogenesis and contributes to embryonic heart development and normal cardiac function later in life.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.407G>A (p.Gly136Ser) rs121912881
- c.638C>T (p.Ala213Val) rs121912883
- c.922A>G (p.Glu308Gly) rs121912882

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.328C>A (p.Thr110Asn) rs1800270
- c.458C>T (p.Pro153Leu) rs1800269

### Related diseases
Mutations in the TBX20 gene have been linked to various cardiac diseases, including:
- Congenital heart disease (CHD)
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- Atrial septal defect (ASD)
- Ventricular septal defect (VSD)

### Treatment and prognosis
The treatment options and prognosis for individuals with TBX20 mutations vary depending on the specific cardiac defect and the severity of the condition. Standard treatment may involve medication, surgery, or a combination of both.

### Drug response
Drug response to TBX20 gene mutations has not been widely studied and is still under investigation.
