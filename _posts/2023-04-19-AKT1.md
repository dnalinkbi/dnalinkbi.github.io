# Gene: AKT1

## Genetic Position
AKT1 is located on chromosome 14q32.33.

## Pathology
AKT1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Mutations in AKT1 have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and lung cancer.

## Function
AKT1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is involved in various signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. It is activated by phosphorylation and regulates downstream targets such as mTOR, FOXO, and GSK-3.

## Related Disease
AKT1 mutations have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
AKT inhibitors, such as ipatasertib and capivasertib, are currently being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The prognosis for patients with AKT1 mutations varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug Response
AKT inhibitors, such as ipatasertib and capivasertib, have shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.
