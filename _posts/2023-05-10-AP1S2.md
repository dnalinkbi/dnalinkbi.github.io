# Gene AP1S2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: X
- Location: Xp22.13
- Strand: minus strand

## Pathology
Mutations in the AP1S2 gene have been associated with X-linked mental retardation type 99 (OMIM: 300958), which is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability.

## Function
AP1S2 encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) complex, which is involved in protein trafficking. Specifically, AP1S2 is part of the clathrin-coated vesicle assembly process and is critical for the transport of cargo from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations in the AP1S2 gene.

## Related Disease
- X-linked mental retardation type 99 (OMIM: 300958)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for X-linked mental retardation type 99. Management is generally supportive and may include special education and/or behavioral therapies as well as medications to address specific symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response specific to mutations in the AP1S2 gene.
