# Analysis of Gene NMU

## Gene Information
- Gene Name: Neuromedin U (NMU)
- Gene ID: 4826
- Aliases: NMU-P, Uromedin
- Chromosomal Location: 12q13.2
- Genomic Position: NC_000012.12:g.51904532_51911675

## Function
The NMU gene encodes a protein called Neuromedin U, which is a neuropeptide that regulates various physiological processes, such as food intake, energy metabolism, cardiovascular function, and stress responses. NMU binds to two G protein-coupled receptors (NMUR1 and NMUR2) and activates intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the modulation of ion channels, second messengers, and gene transcription factors.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 7884
- NCBI Entrez: 4826
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135115
- OMIM: 602666
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16568

## AA Mutations
- No reported pathogenic mutations in NMU gene

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No reported somatic mutations in NMU gene

## Related Disease
- Obesity: Several studies have suggested that NMU may play a role in the regulation of body weight and adiposity. In animal models, NMU administration reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure, resulting in weight loss. However, the relevance of these findings to human obesity remains unclear.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there are no approved drugs that directly target NMU or its receptors for the treatment of obesity or other diseases.
- The long-term prognosis of NMU-related disorders is unknown, as more research is needed to establish the clinical significance of NMU.

## Drug Response
- No reported drugs that specifically target NMU or its receptors for drug response.
