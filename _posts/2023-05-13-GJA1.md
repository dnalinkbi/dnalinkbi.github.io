# Gene GJA1

**Function for gene:** 

GJA1 encodes connexin-43 (Cx43), a transmembrane protein that forms gap junctions and hemichannels that allow for communication between adjacent cells and between cells and the extracellular environment. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

**Related disease:**

Mutations in GJA1 have been associated with several diseases, including oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), congenital heart disease, and various cancers.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

Treatment options for GJA1-associated diseases depend on the specific condition and symptoms. Some treatments may include medications, surgery, or other supportive care measures. Prognosis also varies depending on the disease and its severity.

**Drug response:**

There is insufficient data on drug response for most GJA1-associated diseases.
