# Information about gene VCAM1

## Genetic Position
The VCAM1 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p32.3.

## Pathology
Dysfunction of VCAM1 has been linked to various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, asthma, and arthritis.

## Function
The VCAM1 gene encodes a protein that is expressed on the surface of certain cells, particularly endothelial cells. This protein plays a role in cell adhesion and leukocyte trafficking.

## External IDs
- Gene ID: 7412
