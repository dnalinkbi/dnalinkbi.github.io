### Gene Name: ELOVL4

#### Information about Gene:

- Function: ELOVL4 encodes a protein involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids and is localized in para-cortical regions of lymph nodes.

- External IDs: HGNC:32599, Entrez Gene: 79184, Ensembl: ENSG00000198312, OMIM: 605512 

- Genomic Location: Chromosome 6p14.1

- Aliases: STGD2, SCA34 

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 

    - c.518G>T (p.Gly173Val), rs121918166
    - c.256G>A (p.Trp86*), rs61749929
    - c.254G>A (p.Trp85*), rs61749928
    
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported yet.

- Related Diseases: Autosomal dominant Stargardt disease type 2 (STGD2), Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34). 

- Treatment and Prognosis: There is no cure for Stargardt disease or SCA34, but various treatments are available to manage the symptoms. Low vision aids and vitamin A supplementation can slow down the progression of Stargardt disease. Physiotherapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy can help improve the quality of life of those with SCA34.

- Drug Response: There are no known drugs specific to ELOVL4 mutations for the treatment of Stargardt disease or SCA34.
