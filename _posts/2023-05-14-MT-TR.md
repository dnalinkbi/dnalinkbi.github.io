## Gene MT-TR

### Information
- **Genetic Position**: MT-TR gene is located on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at the position of 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1).
- **Pathology**: Mutations in MT-TR gene are associated with various mitochondrial disorders such as Maternally Inherited Deafness and Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss, Sensorineural.
- **Function**: MT-TR is a protein-coding gene that encodes 12S rRNA, a component of mitochondrial ribosome.
- **Aliases**: MTRNR1, MRPS12.
