# Gene Information: TPM3

## Gene Position 
The TPM3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q22-q23.

## Function
The TPM3 gene encodes for tropomyosin 3 which is an actin-binding protein that stabilizes muscle contraction and muscle fiber organization.

## Related disease
- Autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy type 1 (NEM1)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for NEM1. However, treatment and management of the symptoms can help improve quality of life for affected individuals.

## Drug response
There is no specific drug targeted at TPM3 gene mutations causing NEM1. However, management of symptoms may include physical and occupational therapy, respiratory support, and surgical interventions.
