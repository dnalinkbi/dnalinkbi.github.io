# Genetic Information for Gene ADAM22

**Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function:**

- The ADAM22 gene is located on chromosome 7, at the position 7q21.11.

- It is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of proteins that are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, proteolysis, and signal transduction.

- ADAM22 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and has been implicated in the development and function of synapses in the brain.

- There is evidence to suggest that mutations in the ADAM22 gene can contribute to the development of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia.

**Function for Gene:**

- ADAM22 plays an important role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity.

- It has been shown to interact with other proteins involved in synaptic function, including ion channels, receptors, and scaffolding proteins.

- Studies have also suggested that ADAM22 may play a role in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines, which are important structures for synaptic connectivity.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several mutations in the ADAM22 gene that have been reported in various populations. Here is a list of some of the amino acid mutations along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

|Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|-------------|--------|
|p.E309K|Missense|rs138675027|
|p.R384C|Missense|rs761849063|
|p.R386W|Missense|rs786205006|
|p.A404T|Missense|rs121908693|
|p.R662*|Nonsense|rs876657291|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There is limited information available on somatic mutations in the ADAM22 gene. One study reported a missense mutation (p.V685M) in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, but there is no dbSNP ID available.

**Related Disease:**

- Mutations in the ADAM22 gene have been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy and schizophrenia.

- A study conducted on patients with temporal lobe epilepsy identified several mutations in the ADAM22 gene, suggesting that it may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in the ADAM22 gene. Treatment for epilepsy and schizophrenia usually involves a combination of medications and therapy.

The prognosis for individuals with mutations in the ADAM22 gene depends on the severity of their condition and the treatments that they receive.

**Drug Response:**

There is limited information available on drug response for mutations in the ADAM22 gene.
