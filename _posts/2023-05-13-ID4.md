# Gene ID4

## Genetic Position

- Gene symbol: ID4
- Chromosome: 6
- Location: 6p22.3

## Pathology

- Cancer: ID4 plays a role in several cancer types, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. In some cancer types, ID4 has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor, while in others it promotes cancer progression and metastasis.

## Function

- ID4 belongs to the family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors. It has been shown to regulate the expression of genes that are involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
- ID4 has also been implicated in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

## Related Disease

- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

- ID4 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers. 
- In breast cancer, high ID4 expression has been associated with poor prognosis, while in ovarian cancer it has been linked to a better response to chemotherapy.
- The prognostic value of ID4 expression in other cancer types is yet to be fully understood.

## Drug Response

- ID4 inhibition has been shown to sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. 
- Combination therapy targeting ID4 and other oncogenic pathways has also been proposed as a potential strategy for cancer treatment.
