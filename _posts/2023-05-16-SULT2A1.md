# Information about Gene SULT2A1

## Genomic Position
SULT2A1 gene is located on chromosome 19 at the location 19q13.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in SULT2A1 gene are associated with various diseases including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

## Function
SULT2A1 gene encodes for sulfotransferase which catalyzes the sulfation of hydroxysteroids and bile acids. This process is important for the inactivation and elimination of steroid hormones and drugs from the body.
