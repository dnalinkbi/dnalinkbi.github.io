# Gene B3GALT5

### Pathology
The B3GALT5 gene encodes a protein that catalyzes the synthesis of a specific type of molecule called a glycosaminoglycan. Mutations in this gene can lead to abnormal glycosaminoglycan synthesis, which may result in developmental abnormalities, skeletal defects, and other health problems.

### Function
B3GALT5 encodes an enzyme that adds sugar molecules to proteins and lipids, producing glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. These molecules play important roles in cell signaling, cell adhesion, and other cellular processes.
