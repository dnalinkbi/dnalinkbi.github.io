## Gene CLU Information

CLUSTERIN (CLU) is a gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8p21-p12). It encodes for a secretory chaperone glycoprotein that is involved in a variety of cellular processes including lipid transport, apoptosis, and complement cascade regulation. 

### Function 

The protein produced by the CLU gene is involved in numerous functions such as lipid transport, apoptosis, and regulation of the complement cascade. The protein undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms - a secreted form or a nuclear isoform. The secretory chaperone glycoprotein isoform is involved in extracellular housekeeping while the nuclear isoform is involved in transcription regulation and DNA repair.

### Related Disease 

Mutations in the CLU gene have been associated with various diseases, including:

- Alzheimer's disease 
- Cardiovascular diseases 
- Cancer 
- Kidney diseases 

### Treatment and Prognosis 

Currently, there are no targeted treatments for mutations in the CLU gene. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in the gene is dependent on their associated disease(s). 

### Drug Response 

Studies have suggested an association between genetic variation in the CLU gene and the response to certain drugs. For example, in Alzheimer's patients treated with bapineuzumab and solanezumab, a strong correlation was observed between genetic variants in CLU and clinical outcomes.
