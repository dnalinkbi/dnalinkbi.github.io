# Gene RCAN1

## Genetic Position
- The gene RCAN1 is located on chromosome 21q22.12.

## Pathology
- Research suggests that the overexpression of RCAN1 can lead to damage in neuronal cells, which is implicated in some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.

## Function for Gene
- RCAN1 is an inhibitor of calcineurin, which is an important enzyme in signal transduction pathways. Calcineurin is a calcium-activated phosphatase that is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including neuronal development, immune function, and cardiac hypertrophy. RCAN1 inhibits calcineurin by binding to it and disrupting its function.

## External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs for RCAN1 include:
    - HGNC:15886
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 81833
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000154767
    - OMIM: 605210
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8WY64
- Aliases for RCAN1 include:
    - DSCR1L1
    - MCIP1
    - CSP1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several AA mutations reported for RCAN1, including:
    - R93C (rs56122550)
    - R93H (rs2890658)
    - P170L (rs2273553)
    - P304L (rs2229142)
    - T307A (rs56185929)
- These mutations are missense mutations, where a single nucleotide change results in the substitution of one amino acid for another.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported for RCAN1, including:
    - G40fs (rs1553058555)
    - T177M (rs13306235)
    - E221*
    - G285R (rs2890656)
- These mutations are associated with various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colon cancer.

## Related Disease
- RCAN1 has been implicated in several diseases, including:
    - Alzheimer's disease
    - Down syndrome
    - Diabetes
    - Cardiovascular disease
    - Various cancers

## Treatment and Prognosis
- As RCAN1 is associated with various diseases, treatment options will vary depending on the specific condition. Research is ongoing to determine the potential for RCAN1 inhibitors as a therapeutic option for some diseases.
- Prognosis will also vary depending on the specific disease.

## Drug Response
- Research suggests that RCAN1 inhibition can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy in some cases.
