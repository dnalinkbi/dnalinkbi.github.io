# Gene: JAG1
## Overview
JAG1 is located on chromosome 20p12 and encodes the Jagged1 protein. This gene plays a critical role in developmental processes such as cell differentiation and cell-cell communication.

## Function
Jagged1 is a ligand for Notch receptors and is involved in the regulation of cell fate determination during embryonic development. It also plays a role in adult tissue renewal and regeneration.

## Related disease
Mutations in the JAG1 gene are associated with several conditions including:
- Alagille syndrome (ALGS)
- Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
- Congenital heart defects (CHD)

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for individuals with mutations in the JAG1 gene is typically symptomatic and focused on managing associated conditions. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the mutations and associated symptoms.

## Drug response
There is limited information available on drug response related to JAG1 mutations.
