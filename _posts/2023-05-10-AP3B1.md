# Information About Gene AP3B1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position**: AP3B1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q14.1).

**Pathology**: Mutations in AP3B1 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and late-onset pulmonary fibrosis.

**Function**: AP3B1 gene encodes the beta3A subunit of the adaptor-related protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. AP-3 is responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules.

## Gene Information

**Function for Gene**: AP3B1 is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, specifically the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.

**Related Disease**: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2)

**Treatment and Prognosis**: HPS2 is a rare disorder for which there is no cure. Treatment is supportive and aimed at managing the symptoms of the disease.

**Drug Response**: There is currently no specific drug therapy for HPS2.
