# Information about gene KIRREL3

## Genetic Position
- KIRREL3 is located on chromosome 11 at position 11q24.2-q24.3.

## Pathology
- Mutations in KIRREL3 have been associated with different types of cancer, such as breast, colorectal, and liver cancer.
- KIRREL3 mutations have also been linked to intellectual disability, autosomal recessive 20.

## Function
- KIRREL3 encodes for a protein called Kin of IRRE-like protein 3, which is involved in cell adhesion and plays a role in the development of nervous system and synaptogenesis.
