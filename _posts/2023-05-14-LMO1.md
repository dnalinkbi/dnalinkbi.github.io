# Information about Gene LMO1

## Genetic Position

**LMO1** gene is located on chromosome 11 (11p15.4) in the human genome.

## Pathology

LMO1 plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of several malignancies, particularly neuroblastoma. It has also been linked to various hematopoietic and solid tumors.

## Function for Gene

LMO1 belongs to a family of transcriptional regulators that participate in various biological processes such as hematopoietic differentiation, angiogenesis, and oncogenesis.

- rs372546450

## Related Disease

LMO1 has been linked to various types of tumors, including:

- Neuroblastoma
- Acute T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia
- B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis

Patients with LMO1-associated tumors are usually treated with traditional chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. However, several targeted therapies that aim to inhibit LMO1's oncogenic activity are currently being investigated.

## Drug Response

Several drugs have been developed to target LMO1's oncogenic activity, including:

- Small molecule inhibitors
- Antisense oligonucleotides
- Immunotherapies
