# **Gene PCLO**

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q21.3)
- **Pathology:** PCLO gene variations are associated with psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and autism. 
- **Function:** The protein produced by PCLO gene, Piccolo, is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in the formation and function of synapses. 
- **Aliases:** PCLO, presynaptic cytomatrix protein, Bassoon
