# Information about gene MCPH1

## Gene information

The MCPH1 gene, also known as microcephalin 1, is located on chromosome 8p23.1 and encodes the microcephalin protein. It is involved in the regulation of brain size, particularly in the development of the cerebral cortex.

## Function

Microcephalin is thought to play a role in DNA damage response and repair, cell cycle progression, and centrosome regulation. It has also been implicated in neuronal proliferation and differentiation, as well as cognitive development.

## Mutations

The following amino acid mutations have been reported in the MCPH1 gene:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --------| -----| -------- |
| Arg304Cys | Missense | rs387906814 |
| Arg304His | Missense | rs387906813 |
| Arg304Ser | Missense | rs387906815 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

Several somatic SNVs and InDels have been reported in the MCPH1 gene, including:

- rs796065725
- rs796065727
- rs796065728

## Related diseases

Mutations in MCPH1 have been associated with primary microcephaly, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly reduced head size and intellectual disability.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for microcephaly caused by mutations in MCPH1. Management is largely supportive and aimed at addressing symptoms and complications.

## Drug response

There is limited information on drug response specific to mutations in MCPH1.
