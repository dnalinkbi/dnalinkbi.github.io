## Gene: LTBP4

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Start: 14,962,848 bp
- End: 15,236,543 bp
- Strand: -

### Pathology
Mutations in the human LTBP4 gene have been associated with many diseases, including:
- Cardiovascular Disease
- Fibrosis
- Pulmonary Disease 
- Facial Dysmorphism, and Cognitive Impairment

### Function
The LTBP4 gene encodes a latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein-4 (LTBP4), which has a role in matrix assembly and maintenance, cell adhesion, and as a mediator for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) function.
