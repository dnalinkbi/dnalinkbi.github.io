# Gene: MDK

### Function:
The gene MDK encodes a protein called Midkine which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and neovascularization. It regulates the growth and survival of cells during embryonic and postnatal development in various tissues.

### Genomic data:
- Gene ID: 4192
- Genomic location: Chromosome 11: 60,617,910-60,660,201
- Aliases: NEGF2, MK, GIBF-2, PTN-like protein
- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 6946
    - NCBI Entrez: 4192
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000149485
    - OMIM: 159950
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P21741

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- There are several reported amino acid (AA) mutations in MDK which are associated with different diseases. Some of the AA mutations with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs are given below:
    - G37R	missense variant	Rsid: rs267606788
    - D54N	missense variant	Rsid: rs759477437
    - F78L	missense variant	Rsid: rs758406507

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID identified in MDK are as follows:
    - rs767323508
    - rs747506287
    - rs757722891

### Related disease:
- Studies have indicated that aberrant expression of MDK is associated with various diseases including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases. Some of the diseases reported to be related to MDK are:
    - Breast cancer
    - Lung cancer
    - Ovarian cancer
    - Gastric cancer
    - Hepatocellular carcinoma

### Treatment and prognosis:
- MDK has been reported as a potential therapeutic target in cancer due to its involvement in cancer development and progression. Various approaches have been investigated to target MDK including antibodies, siRNAs, and small molecules. However, the efficacy of these treatments is still under investigation.
- Studies have also suggested that MDK levels can be used as a prognostic marker in certain cancers, where higher MDK expression is associated with poor prognosis.

### Drug response:
- Some drugs have been reported to show potential efficacy against MDK, including Tinzaparin, SB-220453, and Sunitinib. However, more research is needed to explore these drugs as potential treatments for MDK-associated diseases.
