## Gene Information:

Gene Name: SLC36A1  
Location: Chromosome 5q33.1  
Aliases: PAT1, GTR4, MGC45350  

## Function:

SLC36A1 encodes for a proton-coupled amino acid transporter protein, PAT1. The protein is responsible for transporting small neutral amino acids across cell membranes.  

## External IDs and Sites:

HGNC ID: 16779  
NCBI Entrez ID: 55118  
Ensembl ID: ENSG00000170443  
OMIM ID: 609328  
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NY26  

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:

No common AA mutations have been reported in the SLC36A1 gene.  

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

Several somatic mutations have been reported in the SLC36A1 gene. Some of these are:  

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- |
| Missense mutation | rs1554550055 |
| Nonsense mutation | rs1434810601 |
| Splice site mutation | rs56203548 |

## Related Disease:

SLC36A1 mutations have been associated with developmental delay, muscle weakness, and hypotonia. Additionally, SLC36A1 expression has been found to be downregulated in some cancer types.  

## Treatment and Prognosis:

Currently, there are no specific treatments available for SLC36A1 related disorders. However, symptomatic treatment may be given. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disorder.  

## Drug Response:

There is no reported drug response for SLC36A1 related disorders.
