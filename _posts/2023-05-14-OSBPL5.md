## Information about gene OSBPL5

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

**Genetic position:** The OSBPL5 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.1).

**Pathology:** Mutations in the OSBPL5 gene have been associated with several diseases, including Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2), macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease.

**Function:** The OSBPL5 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. This protein plays a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, cholesterol transport, and intracellular vesicle trafficking.
