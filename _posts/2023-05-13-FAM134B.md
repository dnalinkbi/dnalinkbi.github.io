# Information about Gene FAM134B

## Genetic Position
The FAM134B gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31.2). It spans over 47,330 bases and contains 9 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FAM134B gene have been associated with multiple diseases, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) type II, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (CMT2B), and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B (dHMN2B).

## Function
The FAM134B gene encodes a protein that is involved in autophagy, which is the process by which cells degrade and recycle their own components. Specifically, the protein is required for the formation of autophagosomes, which are vesicles that transport cellular material for degradation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the FAM134B gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the FAM134B gene have been associated with various types of neuropathy, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) type II, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (CMT2B), and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B (dHMN2B).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for neuropathy caused by FAM134B mutations. Treatment is typically focused on managing symptoms, which may include pain relief medication, physical therapy, and the use of assistive devices.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available regarding drug response in patients with FAM134B-related neuropathy.
