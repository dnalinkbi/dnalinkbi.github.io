# Genetic Information on Gene CPE

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** CPE
- **Aliases:** Carboxypeptidase E
- **Function for Gene:** The gene CPE encodes for carboxypeptidase E, which is an enzyme that cleaves C-terminal amino acids from polypeptides.
- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC ID: 2380
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000182615
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 1363
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 4q32.1

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List with Mutation Type:** 
    - p.Gly413Arg (Missense)
    - p.Ser165* (Nonsense)
    - p.Arg45Cys (Missense)
- **dbSNP ID for AA mutations:** 
    - rs137853930
    - rs267607041
    - rs137853929
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs79444085
    - rs150994123
    - rs140750898

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis can vary depending on the specific disease associated with the mutation in CPE.
- Some potential treatments for diseases related to CPE mutations include:
    - Weight loss interventions for obesity
    - Insulin therapy and lifestyle changes for diabetes mellitus
    - Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer
- Further research is required to develop more targeted and effective treatments.

## Drug Response
- Studies have suggested that carboxypeptidase E inhibitors may be effective in treating some diseases associated with CPE mutations.
- However, further research is required to determine the safety and efficacy of these inhibitors in human subjects.
