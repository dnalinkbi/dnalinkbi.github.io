# Gene: ETV1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Start Position: 130,643,214 bp
- End Position: 130,828,706 bp

## Pathology
ETV1 is associated with various types of cancer including prostate cancer, melanoma, gastrointestinal tumors, and Ewing's sarcoma.

## Gene Function
ETV1 encodes an ETS transcription factor which regulates genes involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. It is involved in the development of neural crest-derived cells during embryogenesis.

## Related Disease
ETV1 is associated with the development and progression of various types of cancer including prostate adenocarcinoma, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and Ewing's sarcoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for ETV1-associated cancers depend on the type and stage of cancer. Prognosis varies depending on the cancer type and stage at diagnosis.

## Drug Response
There is ongoing research into potential targeted therapies for ETV1-driven cancers.
