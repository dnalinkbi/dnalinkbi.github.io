# Gene FAT1

## Genetic Position

FAT1 gene is located on chromosome 4q35.1.

## Pathology

Aberrations in FAT1 are associated with various human diseases, including cancer.

## Function

The protein encoded by FAT1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in cell adhesion and signaling processes. It functions as a tumor suppressor and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.

## Related Disease

Several studies have reported an association between FAT1 mutations and various types of cancer, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for FAT1-related cancers depend on the type and stage of the cancer. Inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway has shown promising results in preclinical studies. 

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response in FAT1-related cancers.
