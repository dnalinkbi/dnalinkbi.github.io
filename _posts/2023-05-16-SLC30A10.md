# Information About Gene SLC30A10

## Genetic Position 
- SLC30A10 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21).
- The gene spans 34.87 kilobases.

## Pathology and Function
- SLC30A10 encodes for a zinc transporter protein that is primarily expressed in liver and pancreas.
- The protein is involved in zinc absorption, distribution, and excretion.
- Mutations in SLC30A10 have been linked to hepatic and neurologic disorders such as acrodermatitis enteropathica and Parkinson's disease.

## Gene Function
- Zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity.
- Zinc ion binding.
- Metal ion transmembrane transporter activity.

- c.1396C>T (p.Thr466Ile) rs201258557

## Related Disease
- Acrodermatitis enteropathica
- Parkinson's disease
- Alzheimer's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for acrodermatitis enteropathica, however, it can be managed with lifelong zinc supplementation.
- Zinc supplementation has also been shown to improve Parkinson's disease symptoms and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

## Drug Response
- Some SLC30A10 mutations have been associated with aluminum accumulation and subsequent brain damage, thus zinc supplementation may not be effective for individuals with these mutations.
