### Gene BCHE

**Genetic Position**: 3q26.1

**Pathology**: The BCHE gene is associated with a variety of pathologies, including but not limited to paralysis, organophosphate toxicity, and prolonged apnea after anesthesia.

**Aliases**: E1, CHE1, CHE2, ACHE, BChE

**Function**: The BCHE gene encodes for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which is an enzyme found in several tissues, including the liver and nervous system. The primary function of BChE is to hydrolyze choline esters, including acetylcholine, which serves as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system.

- c.994C>T, rs200329116 
- c.1025G>A, rs1495570

**Related Disease**: Butyrylcholinesterase Deficiency, Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Deficiency, Organophosphate Poisoning, and Alzheimer's Disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Current treatment options for BCHE-related pathologies include medications that interact with the BChE enzyme, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

**Drug Response**: BCHE gene variants have been linked to drug response in several studies, including response to cocaine and donepezil.
