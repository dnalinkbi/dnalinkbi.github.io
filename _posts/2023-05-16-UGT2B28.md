# Gene Information for UGT2B28
UGT2B28 is a gene that codes for the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, which plays an important role in the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including hormones, drugs, and toxins. The UGT2B28 gene is located on chromosome 4q13-q21 and spans a genomic region of 15.7 kb. 

## Function for gene
The UGT2B28 gene is primarily involved in glucuronidation, a process that adds a glucuronic acid moiety to a substrate, rendering it more water-soluble and facilitating its elimination from the body. It has been shown that the UGT2B28 enzyme specifically catalyzes the glucuronidation of testosterone and several of its metabolites.

## Related disease
There have been several studies linking variations in the UGT2B28 gene with an increased risk for prostate cancer, due to its role in testosterone metabolism. In addition, UGT2B28 activity has been shown to affect drug metabolism and response, particularly for several antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. 

## Treatment and prognosis 
Currently, there are no specific treatments targeting UGT2B28 activity. However, variations in the gene may affect drug efficacy or sensitivity, so personalized medication plans may be beneficial for patients with certain UGT2B28 genotypes.

## Drug response
Variations in the UGT2B28 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism and response for several medications, including: 

- Venlafaxine
- Risperidone
- Olanzapine
- Methadone
- Morphine
