### Gene Information for GUCA1A
- Gene Function: GUCA1A encodes a protein called "guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1" (GCAP1) that is essential for the function of rod photoreceptor cells in the retina.
- External IDs: 
  - Gene ID: 2978
  - Genomic Location: Chromosome 6 (6p21.1)
  - Aliases: GCAP, GUCA

  - p.Glu155Lys (rs61750844)
  - p.Ala178Val (rs61753329)
  - p.Ala185Ser (rs61750843)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - No significant somatic mutations are reported in dbSNP for this gene.
- Related Disease: 
  - GUCA1A mutations and dysfunctions are associated with autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (ADCD) and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), which are rare genetic eye disorders that affect the function of cone and/or rod photoreceptor cells in the retina.
- Treatment and Prognosis: 
  - There is currently no cure for ADCD or CORD, but various treatments and interventions can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. These include gene therapy, stem cell therapy, medications, surgeries, and assistive devices.
- Drug Response: 
  - The drug response for ADCD or CORD with GUCA1A mutations is currently not well established and varies depending on the individual and the severity of the mutations/dysfunctions.
