## Gene APC

### Genetic Position
The APC gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 at position 21.2 (5q21.2).

### Pathology
Mutations in the APC gene are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited condition that predisposes individuals to the development of multiple polyps in the colon and rectum. These polyps can progress to colorectal cancer if left untreated.

### Function
The APC gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell division and the maintenance of genomic stability. Specifically, the APC protein helps to control the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in the development and maintenance of many tissues in the body.

### Related Disease
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for FAP typically involves regular colonoscopies to monitor for the development of polyps and surgical removal of polyps or the entire colon as needed. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.

### Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response specific to APC mutations.
