### Gene Information

**Gene Name:** B4GALT7

**Aliases:** β1,4-galactosyltransferase, beta 4-galactosyltransferase 7

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 5: 36,746,247-36,795,448

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 950
- NCBI Entrez: 8703
- Ensembl: ENSG00000131536
- OMIM: 604327
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60502

### Function

B4GALT7 encodes a β1,4-galactosyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of galactose to a variety of substrates including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. It plays an important role in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates, particularly in the formation of the type 1 chain of glycosphingolipids and O-linked glycans.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for B4GALT7 in dbSNP.

### Related Diseases

Mutations in B4GALT7 have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type, also known as EDSP. This disorder is characterized by a premature aging phenotype that includes severe growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, osteoporosis, joint contractures, and skin hyperlaxity.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and complications associated with the disorder. However, early diagnosis and appropriate management can improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

### Drug Response

There is currently no drug therapy specifically approved for the treatment of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type. However, ongoing research is exploring potential treatment options, including the use of growth hormone therapy and other targeted therapies.
