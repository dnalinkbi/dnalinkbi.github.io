# Gene: CTH

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p31.1
- Strand: -

## Pathology

CTH gene is associated with hypercysteinemia, Oasthouse syndrome, and homocystinuria.

## Function

CTH gene encodes a cystathionase enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the transsulfuration pathway, converting cystathionine to cysteine.

## External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: HGNC:2500
- NCBI Entrez ID: 1491
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163083
- OMIM ID: 613381
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P32929
- Aliases: CGL, CYSK, MST117, MSTP117, MSTP117T

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations reported in CTH gene. The following are some examples:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L10P | Missense | rs28936415 |
| A57V | Missense | rs121964921 |
| R125C | Missense | rs121964923 |
| Q240P | Missense | rs121964925 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no somatic mutations reported in CTH gene.

## Related Disease

- Homocystinuria
- Oasthouse syndrome
- Hypercysteinemia

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment for CTH-related diseases involves a low methionine diet, and the supplementation with vitamin B6, B12, and folate. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent neurological and developmental complications.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug response for CTH gene.
