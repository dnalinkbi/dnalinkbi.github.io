# Gene DSG4

## Genetic Position
DSG4 gene, also known as desmoglein-4, is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 at position 12.1.

## Pathology and Function
DSG4 gene encodes a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the desmoglein family. These proteins are present in desmosomes, which are intercellular junctions that provide Mechanical strength and stability to tissues. DSG4 plays an essential role in the maintenance of the skin's integrity and permeability barrier function. Its loss-of-function mutations are associated with the development of skin diseases, such as pemphigus, a blistering autoimmune disease involving skin and mucosa.

## Related Disease
- Pemphigus vulgaris
- Pemphigus foliaceus

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for pemphigus usually includes therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and rituximab. Early diagnosis and treatment can lead to better outcomes and may prevent life-threatening complications.

## Drug Response
Genetic variations in DSG4 may affect individual drug response to immunosuppressive drugs used to treat pemphigus.
