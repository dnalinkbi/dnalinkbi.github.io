# Gene Information for F2RL1

## Genetic Position
F2RL1 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

## Pathology and Function
F2RL1 gene encodes the protein called Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2). PAR-2 belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and is involved in various processes such as inflammation, pain, and cancer progression.
