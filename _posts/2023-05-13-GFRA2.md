## Gene GFRA2 

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 8: 196,793,783-196,883,242 

**Pathology:** GFRA2 gene has been associated with various diseases such as Hirschsprung disease, neuroblastoma, and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.

**Function:** GFRA2 encodes a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands. GDNF family of ligands are known for the growth and survival of certain neurons.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** 

Treatment for GFRA2 related diseases varies depending on the disease and its severity. Surgical intervention, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation may be options for certain diseases. Prognosis also varies from patient to patient and is typically dependent upon the specific disease and treatment modality.

**Drug Response:** 

Drug response varies depending upon the specific disease. For example, in neuroblastoma, drugs such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine are often used, but the response can vary from patient to patient.
