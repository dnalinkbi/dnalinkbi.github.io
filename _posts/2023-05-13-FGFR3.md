# Gene FGFR3

## Genetic Position
The FGFR3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3) gene is located on chromosome 4 at position q16.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FGFR3 gene have been associated with several disorders, including skeletal dysplasias and cancer. Mutations such as Gly380Arg have been shown to cause achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.

## Function for gene
The FGFR3 gene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for genetic disorders caused by FGFR3 mutations and treatment is typically supportive. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and varies widely.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs that target FGFR3 specifically. However, there are ongoing clinical trials exploring the use of FGFR inhibitors in the treatment of some cancers.
