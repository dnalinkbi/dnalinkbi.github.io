## Gene: ING1

### Genetic Position
- ING1 is located on chromosome 13q34
- It spans a genomic region of 11,615 base pairs

### Pathology
- ING1 has been associated with various cancers, including gliomas, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer
- It has been shown to play a role in tumor suppression

### Function
- ING1 encodes a protein that plays a role in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis
- It has been shown to interact with various other proteins involved in these processes

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6029
- NCBI Entrez: 3623
- Ensembl: ENSG00000102755
- OMIM: 602369
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UK53
- Aliases: p33(ING1b), p47(ING1a), and inhibitor of growth family member 1
