# Gene BBS10

## Information

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12q21.2

### Pathology
Mutations in the BBS10 gene have been associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems such as the eyes, kidneys, and skeleton.

### Function
BBS10 encodes a protein that is involved in the assembly of microtubules and cilia, which are important for the function of various cell types and tissues in the body.

### External IDs and Aliases

- Ensembl: ENSG00000163902
- OMIM: 610148
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NFJ9
- Aliases: BBS10L

### AA Mutations and Types with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala379Val (rs61748280)
- p.Glu423Lys (rs61748281)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None Reported

### Related Disease
- Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently there is no cure for Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. There is symptomatic management for some of the symptoms of the disease (e.g. retinal degeneration, obesity, renal complications).

### Drug Response
Not applicable
