## Gene: EIF4A2

### Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 3 (3q27.1)
- **Pathology:** N/A
- **Function:** EIF4A2 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, which is involved in the initiation of translation and the recognition and binding of the 5' cap structure of mRNA. It is also known to play a crucial role in RNA splicing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 

### External IDs

- **Gene ID:** 1974
- **Genomic location:** NC_000003.12 (148,909,321-148,970,301)
- **Aliases:** eIF-4AII, eIF4AI-2, DDx2B

### External Sites

- **HGNC:** HGNC:3272
- **NCBI Entrez:** 1974
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000114407
- **OMIM:** 603654
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** P38919
