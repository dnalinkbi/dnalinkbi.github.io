# Gene: KCNE1L

## General Information
- Function: The KCNE1L gene encodes for a protein that interacts with and modifies the activity of various ion channels, mainly potassium channels. 
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 160365
    - Genomic Location: Chr19:36,858,828-36,868,122
    - Aliases: MGC32667, MiRP4, LKCNE4

## Molecular Genetics
- AA Mutation List: 
    - R9H with dbSNP ID: rs794727224
    - R9C with dbSNP ID: rs149351259
    - Y3C with dbSNP ID: rs149669067
- Mutation Type:
    - Missense Mutations
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported

## Related Diseases
- Cardiovascular Diseases: KCNE1L variants have been implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, primarily long QT syndrome.
- Hearing Loss: Studies have identified a possible association between the KCNE1L gene and age-related hearing loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for long QT syndrome depend on the specific gene variant involved. Beta blockers are the first-line therapy. KCNE1L-related long QT syndrome may not respond as well to beta blockers, and alternative treatments such as pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators may be necessary in severe cases.
- The prognosis for KCNE1L-related long QT syndrome varies depending on the severity of the disease and the presence of other risk factors.

## Drug Response
- Some studies have suggested that certain drugs, such as mexiletine, may be effective in treating KCNE1L-related long QT syndrome.
