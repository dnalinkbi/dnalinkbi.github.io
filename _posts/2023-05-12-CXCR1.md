# Information on gene CXCR1

## Summary
The gene CXCR1 is located on chromosome 2q35-q36 and encodes for a chemokine receptor protein that is expressed on the surface of neutrophils. The CXCR1 protein functions by binding to interleukin-8 (IL-8) and other chemokines to elicit innate immune responses. Dysregulation of CXCR1 has been implicated in various disease states, including cancer, inflammation, and infections.

## Function
The CXCR1 protein functions as a receptor for IL-8 and mediates neutrophil chemotaxis to sites of inflammation and infection. It also plays a role in leukocyte adhesion, transmigration, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. CXCR1 is critical for the early host response to bacterial and fungal infections, and its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

## Related disease
Dysregulation of CXCR1 has been implicated in various disease states, including:
- Cancer (prostate, ovarian, bladder, etc.)
- Inflammatory diseases (cystic fibrosis, COPD, etc.)
- Infectious diseases (sepsis, pneumonia, etc.)

## Treatment and prognosis
Targeting CXCR1 with specific inhibitors has shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of various diseases. However, clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of CXCR1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy are still ongoing.

## Drug response
Inhibition of CXCR1 has shown promise in reducing inflammation and tumor progression in various preclinical models. However, the use of CXCR1 inhibitors in the clinic is still under investigation.
