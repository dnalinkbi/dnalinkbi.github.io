### Gene: SHOC2

- Function: SHOC2 (also known as SUR-8) is a scaffold protein that interacts with the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. SHOC2 enhances the activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway by stabilizing the complex of RAF1-MEK1 and promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane.

- Related disease: Genetic variants in SHOC2 have been associated with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH), a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and abnormal hair growth.
- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment and prognosis depend on the severity of the symptoms and the underlying genetic cause. NS/LAH patients require a multidisciplinary approach, including management of developmental and behavioral issues and evaluation for potential cardiovascular abnormalities.
- Drug response: There is no specific drug treatment for NS/LAH at present. However, drugs targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway, such as MEK inhibitors, have been developed for various types of cancer and could potentially be repurposed for NS/LAH.
