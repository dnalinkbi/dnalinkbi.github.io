# Information about gene RAG2

## Genetic Position
The RAG2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11, at position 11p13. This gene spans approximately 37.8 kilobases (kb) and consists of 17 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in the RAG2 gene can lead to a rare disorder known as Omenn syndrome. This disorder is characterized by severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), erythroderma, alopecia, and hepatosplenomegaly.

## Function
The RAG2 gene plays a critical role in V(D)J recombination, which is the process by which immune cells generate receptor diversity. Specifically, RAG2 is involved in the cleavage of DNA at recombination signal sequences (RSS) during this process.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 5897
- HGNC: 9817
- Ensembl: ENSG00000175345
- NCBI Entrez: 5897
- OMIM: 179616
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55895
- Aliases: RAG-2, RS-SCID

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported missense mutations in the RAG2 gene, including:
- G132R (rs587776828)
- R229Q (rs202172271)
- R229W (rs797045706)

These mutations are all classified as pathogenic and have been associated with Omenn syndrome.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the RAG2 gene.

## Related Disease
As previously mentioned, mutations in the RAG2 gene can lead to Omenn syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by severe combined immunodeficiency, erythroderma, alopecia, and hepatosplenomegaly.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for Omenn syndrome typically involves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy. The prognosis for individuals with Omenn syndrome can vary, but may be poor without intervention.

## Drug Response
There is currently no established drug response information for Omenn syndrome or RAG2 mutations.
