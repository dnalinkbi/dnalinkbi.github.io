# Gene: TBX22

## Basic Information
- **Function**: TBX22 is a member of the T-box transcription factors family. It is involved in embryonic development of craniofacial structures and tooth germ. Mutations in this gene are associated with X-linked cleft palate with ankyloglossia syndrome (CPX).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for TBX22 in the dbSNP database.

## Associated Diseases
Mutations in the TBX22 gene are associated with X-linked cleft palate with ankyloglossia syndrome (CPX).

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for CPX is symptomatic, and currently, there is no cure for the condition. Patients with CPX usually require multiple surgeries, speech therapy, and orthodontic care.

## Drug Response
No specific drugs have been identified for the treatment of TBX22 mutations as it is a genetic disorder.
