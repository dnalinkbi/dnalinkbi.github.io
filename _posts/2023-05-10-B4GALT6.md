# Information about Gene B4GALT6 

## Genetic Position 
Gene B4GALT6 is located on chromosome 3q13.31.

## Pathology and Function
Gene B4GALT6 is responsible for encoding a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) family, which catalyzes the formation of complex glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids. This gene plays a role in the biosynthesis of the non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan keratan sulfate.

## Gene Function
The gene function of B4GALT6 is Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6.

## External IDs, Aliases and Locations
External IDs for B4GALT6 include:
- HGNC: 9483 
- NCBI Entrez: 8708 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000152610 
- OMIM: 604327 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UBX7 

Aliases for B4GALT6 include:
- beta4Gal-T6 
- beta4GalT6 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The AA mutation list and mutation type for gene B4GALT6 in dbSNP includes:
- V248M, Missense, rs28364571
- L384S, Missense, rs138071327
- V436M, Missense, rs147449588

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no information available on somatic SNVs/Indels in gene B4GALT6.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in this gene are associated with muscle-eye-brain disease and congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies type A6.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for muscle-eye-brain disease. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic and may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and medications for seizures and spasticity. The prognosis for these conditions is variable and dependent on the specific mutation and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs that specifically target gene B4GALT6.
