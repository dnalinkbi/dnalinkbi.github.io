# Gene Information for SRC

## Description and Functionality
SRC is a protein coding gene that encodes a tyrosine kinase protein, which regulates various cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell division, and differentiation. It belongs to the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase (NRPTK) family and is involved in several cell signaling pathways, such as the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway.

## Related Diseases
Abnormal expression and mutation status of SRC have been associated with various types of cancers, including breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeted therapies that inhibit the SRC kinase activity, such as dasatinib, have shown promising results in clinical trials for treating certain types of cancer, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the efficacy of these treatments varies depending on the disease and the mutation status of the gene. 

## Drug Response
The response to SRC inhibitors primarily depends on the mutation status of the gene. Several studies have reported that patients with SRC mutations, particularly those with mutations in the kinase domain, are more responsive to dasatinib treatment compared to those without SRC mutations.
