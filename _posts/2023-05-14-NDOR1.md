## Gene Information

The gene NDOR1 is located on chromosome 16 at the position 16p13.3. NDOR1 is also known as NADH:quinone oxidoreductase subunit B1 or NDUFB1. It has aliases such as B17.2, CI-B17.2, and NDUFB.

## Function

NDOR1 is a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Complex I plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain, which is responsible for generating ATP, the cell's main energy source. NDOR1 is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the respiratory chain.

## Mutations

A few mutations have been associated with NDOR1. The following AA mutations and mutation types have been reported:

- p.Val16Ile (missense variant, rs112099993)
- p.Ser23Thr (missense variant, rs34876279)
- p.Asp33Asn (missense variant, rs35262223)
- p.Asn42Ser (missense variant, rs112303278)
- p.Pro216Leu (missense variant, rs150970200)

## Related Diseases

Mutations in NDOR1 have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a rare condition that affects the function of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Symptoms of complex I deficiency vary widely and can include muscle weakness, developmental delay, and seizures.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive, and may include medications to manage seizures, physical therapy to improve muscle function, and vitamin supplements to improve energy production.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response specific to NDOR1 mutations.
