## Gene: ADAM9 (ADAM Metallopeptidase Domain 9)

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location
The ADAM9 gene is located on chromosome 8 at the position 8p11.21. The genomic location of ADAM9 is NC_000008.11 (39172748-39283232).

### Pathology
ADAM9 has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. ADAM9 plays an important role in cell adhesion, cell fusion, and cell signaling pathways, which are all critical in cancer progression.

### Function
ADAM9 is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, which function as membrane-bound metalloproteases. The function of ADAM9 is to cleave and shed extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins, which affects the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### External IDs and aliases
External IDs for ADAM9 are HGNC: 252, NCBI Entrez: 8754, Ensembl: ENSG00000120907, OMIM: 602254, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13443. Some common aliases for ADAM9 include: ADAM 9, CORD9, MDC9, and MCMP.

### AA Mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported for ADAM9. These include:

- R303H (dbSNP ID: rs28389231)
- S228N (dbSNP ID: rs61733260)
- T98N (dbSNP ID: rs72895895)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations have been reported for ADAM9 in various cancers. These include:

- A823V (dbSNP ID: rs55904607)
- G169R (dbSNP ID: rs764604306)
- E365K (dbSNP ID: rs78723815)

### Related diseases
ADAM9 has been implicated in various diseases, including:

- Cancer (breast, lung, bladder, colon, pancreatic, prostate)
- Alzheimer's disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Atherosclerosis

### Treatment and Prognosis
ADAM9 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Inhibition of ADAM9 can reduce tumor growth and metastasis in several types of cancer. The prognosis for patients with ADAM9-associated diseases varies, depending on the specific disease and the severity of the condition. 

### Drug response
Several drugs targeting ADAM9 have been developed or are currently in clinical trials, including ADAM9 antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. These drugs have shown promising results in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in preclinical studies and clinical trials.
