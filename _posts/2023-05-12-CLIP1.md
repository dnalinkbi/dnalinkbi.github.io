# Gene CLIP1

- **Function:** 
    
    The CLIP1 gene encodes a protein called CLIP-170, which is involved in microtubule stabilization, spindle organization, chromosome movements, and vesicle transport. Additionally, it plays a critical role in maintaining the cytoskeleton and influencing cell morphology. CLIP-170 also contributes to the regulation of cell division by interacting with other cytoskeletal proteins.

- **Related disease:**

    Mutations in the CLIP1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability and cortical malformations. Variants in this gene have also been implicated in colon cancer.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**

    There is no known cure for the intellectual disability and cortical malformations associated with CLIP1 gene mutations. Treatment options aim to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment for colon cancer patients with CLIP1 variants includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

- **Drug response:**

    There is no information available regarding drug response related to the CLIP1 gene.
