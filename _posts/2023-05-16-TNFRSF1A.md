# Gene TNFRSF1A

## Genetic Position

The TNFRSF1A gene is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12p13.2.

## Pathology

Mutations in this gene have been associated with multiple diseases, including:

- TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)
- Familial Hibernian fever (FHF)
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Alzheimer's disease
- Lupus erythematosus
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Psoriasis

## Function

The TNFRSF1A gene encodes a protein known as tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), which is a member of the TNF receptor family. The TNF receptor family includes a set of proteins that regulate immune cell functions, including cell survival, death, and differentiation. TNFR1 is expressed by most cell types and is involved in the inflammatory response.
