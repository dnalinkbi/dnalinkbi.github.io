# Gene: ITIH4

**Function:** ITIH4 (Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4) encodes a plasma protein that belongs to the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (ITI) family. It plays a major role in controlling inflammatory responses through inhibition of endogenous proteases contributing to tissue damage. Additionally, it plays a role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix and regulating cell proliferation.
