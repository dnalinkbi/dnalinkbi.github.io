# Information about Gene DMRT1

## Genetic Position
The DMRT1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9p24.3) in humans.

## Pathology
Mutations in DMRT1 gene have been associated with disorders of sexual development, including gonadal dysgenesis in humans. In addition, DMRT1 gene overexpression has been implicated in testicular germ cell tumors.

## Function 
The DMRT1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in male gonadal development and differentiation. Specifically, it is involved in the development of Sertoli cells and the maintenance of male germ cell viability.

- p.R365W / missense / rs121912663

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the DMRT1 gene.

## Related disease
Mutations in DMRT1 gene have been linked to disorders of sexual development, including gonadal dysgenesis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of gonadal dysgenesis and other disorders of sexual development typically involves hormone replacement therapy and/or surgery. The prognosis for individuals with these conditions can vary depending on the severity of the disorder and the specific mutations present in the DMRT1 gene.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in the DMRT1 gene.
