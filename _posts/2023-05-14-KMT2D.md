    - Gene ID: HGNC:16616
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 12q13.12
    - Aliases: ALR, KABUK1, KMT2D, TNRC21

#### Related Diseases:
- Mutations in the KMT2D gene have been associated with a number of disorders, including:
    - Kabuki syndrome, a rare congenital disorder.
    - Several types of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment for Kabuki syndrome generally involves a multidisciplinary approach to address individual needs, including things like surgical interventions, physical therapy, and speech therapy.
- Treatment options for KMT2D-related cancers depend on the type and stage of the cancer, but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.
- The prognosis for individuals with KMT2D mutations varies depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms.

#### Drug Response:
- There is currently limited information regarding drug response specific to KMT2D-related conditions.
