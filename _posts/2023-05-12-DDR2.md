# Gene: DDR2

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- The DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1, specifically at position 36.23 (1q23.3).
- Mutations in DDR2 have been found to be associated with several types of cancer, including lung, colon, breast, and ovarian cancers. 

## Function for Gene

- DDR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is involved in the maintenance of connective tissues and bone formation.
