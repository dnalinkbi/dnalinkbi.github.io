# Information about Gene PDK3 

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** PDK3 gene is located on the chromosome 7q31.31. 

- **Pathology:** The PDK3 gene is associated with several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and various types of cancer. 

- **Function:** The PDK3 gene encodes for the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This enzyme inhibits the PDC by phosphorylating and deactivating its catalytic subunit. By doing so, it prevents the entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and promotes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate through the glycolytic pathway. 

## Gene Information

- **Function for Gene:** The PDK3 gene encodes for the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) enzyme, which regulates the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).

     - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15119
     - Alias: PDK2B, PDK3, PDHK3
     
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** There are several mutations reported in the PDK3 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. Some of the reported mutations with their dbSNP ID are:
     - c.286A>G (p.Asn96Ser) rs2238958
     - c.455G>A (p.Asp152Asn) rs2272065
     - c.1124C>T (p.Ala375Val) rs1143667
     - c.1211G>A (p.Ala404Thr) rs1803202
     
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Somatic mutations in the PDK3 gene have been reported in various types of cancer. Some examples are:
     - c.455G>A (p.Asp152Asn) rs2272065
     - c.604G>A (p.Arg202His) rs11564018
     - c.1124C>T (p.Ala375Val) rs1143667
     
- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the PDK3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
     - Alzheimer's disease
     - Parkinson's disease
     - Diabetes Mellitus
     - Breast Cancer
     - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
     
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with PDK3 mutations depend on the specific condition and the severity of the mutation. Currently, there are no specific treatments available for PDK3-related diseases. 

- **Drug Response:** The PDK3 enzyme has been the target of several drugs, including dichloroacetate (DCA). DCA inhibits the activity of PDK3, leading to the activation of the PDC and promoting the entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. DCA has been investigated as a potential treatment for various types of cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.
