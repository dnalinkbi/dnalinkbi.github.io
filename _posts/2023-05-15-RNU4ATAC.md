## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** RNU4ATAC

**Pathology:** RNU4ATAC gene is associated with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I)

**Function:** RNU4ATAC gene produces U4atac (U4atac snRNA), which is a component of the minor spliceosome. This spliceosome is involved in the splicing of the rare class of pre-mRNA introns that contain a specific sequence structure at their 5' splice site, such as the U12-type introns.

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2q14.2

**Aliases:** U4atac, RNA, U4atac small nuclear, U4atac snRNA, U4atac small nuclear RNA

**External IDs:** 

- HGNC: 10400
- NCBI Entrez: 109637646
- Ensembl: ENSG00000228056
- OMIM: 601428
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NUU6

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

No AA mutations associated with the RNU4ATAC gene have been reported in the dbSNP database.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the RNU4ATAC gene have been reported in the dbSNP database.

**Related Disease:**

The RNU4ATAC gene is associated with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I), which is a rare genetic condition characterized by severe growth retardation, microcephaly, skeletal abnormalities, and other developmental abnormalities.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

There is no cure for MOPD I, and treatment is based on the individual patient's symptoms. Treatment may include growth hormone therapy, physical therapy, and surgical interventions for skeletal abnormalities.

**Drug Response:**

There is no information available on drug response related to RNU4ATAC gene.
