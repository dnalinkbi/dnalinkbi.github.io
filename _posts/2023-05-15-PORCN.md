### Gene PORCN
- **Function:** The gene PORCN encodes an enzyme that is involved in the modification and secretion of Wnt signaling proteins, which play a crucial role in various developmental processes.
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 19510; NCBI Entrez: 64840; Ensembl: ENSG00000131914; OMIM: 300651; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BYF1
- **Aliases:** MGC120506, MGC120507, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein regulating factor 1 homolog
- **AA mutation list:** The AA mutation list for PORCN can be found on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
- **Mutation type with dbSNP ID:** The mutation type and dbSNP ID for PORCN can be found on the NCBI dbSNP database.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for PORCN can be found on the COSMIC database.
- **Related disease:** Mutations in the PORCN gene are associated with a rare X-linked dominant disorder called focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), which affects the development of the skin, eyes, and other organs.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no cure for FDH, and treatment options are generally aimed at managing the symptoms. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition.
- **Drug response:** Currently, there are no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of FDH, but some symptom relief may be achieved with the use of pain medication, eye drops to prevent dryness, and skin care products to protect against skin damage.
