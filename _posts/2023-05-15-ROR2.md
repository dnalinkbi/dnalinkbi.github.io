## Gene Information

**Gene**: ROR2

**Function**: The ROR2 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a crucial role during embryonic development.

**External IDs**: 
- HGNC: 10249
- NCBI Entrez: 4920 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138379
- OMIM: 602337 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01974

**Genomic Location**: Chromosome 9: 99,745,182-99,819,232

**Aliases**: NTRKR2, BDB, BDB1, BDB2, CDw202b

## Mutations and Related Diseases

**AA Mutation List**:
- c.1544G>A (p.Arg515Gln, rs374955335)
- c.1798C>G (p.Pro600Arg, rs121908001)
- c.1076C>T (p.Thr359Met, rs863225986)

All these mutations are pathogenic and associated with an autosomal-recessive disorder known as Robinow syndrome, which affects bone and face development.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
No somatic mutations have been reported for ROR2 gene in dbSNP database.

## Related Disease, Treatment, and Prognosis

**Related Diseases**: Robinow syndrome, Brachydactyly type B1, and recessive Robinow syndrome.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no known cure for Robinow syndrome. Treatment typically focuses on managing the symptoms and providing support to affected individuals.

## Drug Response

No drug has been specifically developed to target ROR2. However, certain drugs have been found to be effective in treating symptoms of Robinow syndrome. These include growth hormone therapy, orthopedic treatments, and cosmetic surgery.
