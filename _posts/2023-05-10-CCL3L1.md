# Gene CCL3L1

### Genetic Position
CCL3L1 is a gene located on chromosome 17q12 region, from base pair 35,373,522 to base pair 35,377,353.

### Pathology and Function
CCL3L1 encodes for a chemokine called CCL3, which plays a key role in the immune system by attracting various immune cells, including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, to the site of inflammation. CCL3L1 has been associated with various inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as infectious diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis.
