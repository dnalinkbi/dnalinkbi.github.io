# Gene MT-TN

**Genetic Position:** The MT-TN gene is located on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at position 5,452-5,583.

**Pathology and Function:** The MT-TN gene encodes for transfer RNA (tRNA) for the amino acid phenylalanine. The mutation in this gene can lead to mitochondrial diseases and influence energy production.

**Function for gene:** The MT-TN gene encodes for transfer RNA (tRNA) that carries the amino acid phenylalanine during protein synthesis in the mitochondria.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**
- HGNC ID: HGNC:7488
- NCBI Entrez ID: 4571
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000228253
- OMIM ID: 590090
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P15990
- Genomic Position: MT:5452-5583

**Aliases:**
- TRNF 
- MTTF 
- PheU

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several known mutations in the MT-TN gene, including:
- m.5703G>A: Pathogenic, Homoplasmic, also known as MT-TN p.Arg12His, (dbSNP ID: rs61750310)
- m.5703G>C: Pathogenic, Homoplasmic, also known as MT-TN p.Arg12Pro, (dbSNP ID: rs281865255)
- m.5703G>T: Pathogenic, Homoplasmic, also known as MT-TN p.Arg12Leu, (dbSNP ID: rs199476128)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- There are known somatic mutations for MT-TN gene, however, no dbSNP IDs are available for these.

**Related Disease:**
Mutations in the MT-TN gene have been associated with mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
There is currently no cure for mitochondrial diseases. Treatment usually involves alleviating symptoms and preventing complications. Prognosis depends on the severity and type of mitochondrial disease.

**Drug Response:**
There is no specific drug available to treat mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the MT-TN gene. However, some medications such as Coenzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, and vitamins have shown promise in some clinical studies.
