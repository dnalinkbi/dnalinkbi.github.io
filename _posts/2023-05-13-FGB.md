# Information about Gene FGB

**Genetic Position:** FGB gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q28-q31). 

**Pathology:** Mutations in FGB gene have been associated with various diseases such as thrombophilia, hemophilia, and dysfibrinogenemia.

**Function:** FGB gene encodes a protein called fibrinogen beta chain, which is one of the three chains that make up fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is a large glycoprotein that is synthesized in the liver and is essential for blood clotting.

**External IDs:**

- GeneID: 2243
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171564
- HGNC: 3530
- OMIM: 134820
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P02675

**Aliases:** FGB gene is also known by the following names:

- Fibrinogen beta chain
- FGA
- FGG

**AA Mutation List:**

- p.Arg448Lys (rs28933972)
- p.Arg19Gly (rs3755724)
- p.Arg448Trp (rs56216930)
- p.Arg121Gln (rs755367305)

**Mutation Type:** Missense mutations

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels in FGB gene along with their dbSNP IDs are:

- c.1405C>T (rs138950319)
- c.1274G>A (rs138950325)
- c.1499G>A (rs120803834)

**Related Disease:** Mutations in FGB gene have been associated with the following diseases:

- Congenital afibrinogenemia
- Hypofibrinogenemia
- Dysfibrinogenemia
- Thrombophilia
- Pulmonary embolism

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis of the diseases associated with FGB gene mutations vary depending on the severity of the condition. In some cases, fresh frozen plasma or fibrinogen concentrate may be used to replace the missing or defective fibrinogen.

**Drug Response:** The drug response of the diseases associated with FGB gene mutations may also vary. For example, anticoagulant therapy may be used to treat thrombophilia or prevent blood clots in some cases.
