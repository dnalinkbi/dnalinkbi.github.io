# Gene: RMI2

## Genetic Position
- RMI2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at the position 16q23.1.

## Pathology
- Studies have shown that mutations in the RMI2 gene are associated with genomic instability and the development of cancer.

## Function
- The RMI2 gene encodes the RecQ-mediated genome instability protein 2, which is a part of the BLM-TOP3A-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex. This complex plays a critical role in the resolution of DNA structures during DNA replication and recombination. The RMI2 protein functions as a regulatory subunit of the complex and is required for its function.

- Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels and their dbSNP IDs are:
    - c.335G>T (p.Glu112Asp) rs543418016
    - c.510C>T (p.Arg170*) rs756963003
    - c.659C>T (p.Arg220*) rs200343495

## Related Disease
- Mutations in the RMI2 gene have been implicated in the development of multiple types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment and prognosis for cancer patients with RMI2 mutations.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug that has been developed to target RMI2 mutations. However, ongoing research may identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of RMI2-associated cancers.
