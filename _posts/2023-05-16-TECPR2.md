# Information about Gene TECPR2

## Genetic Position
The TECPR2 gene is located on chromosome 14q32.33.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TECPR2 gene have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder, called progressive myoclonus epilepsy-ataxia syndrome or PMEAX. PMEAX is characterized by the progressive development of cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, and intellectual disability.

## Function
The TECPR2 gene encodes for the protein Tectonin beta-propeller repeat-containing protein 2, which is involved in protein trafficking through the endosomal system.

## AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported in the TECPR2 gene. Some of the reported mutations are:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|p.Asp970Gly|Missense|rs764759438|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the TECPR2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the TECPR2 gene have been associated with progressive myoclonus epilepsy-ataxia syndrome or PMEAX.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for PMEAX. Treatment is mainly supportive, which includes anti-epileptic medications, physical and occupational therapy, and medications to manage myoclonus.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug available for the treatment of PMEAX, and drug response may vary among patients.
