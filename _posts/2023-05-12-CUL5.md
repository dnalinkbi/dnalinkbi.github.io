# Gene: CUL5

**Function:** The CUL5 gene encodes a protein that is involved in protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It acts as part of an E3 ligase complex and is involved in regulating a wide range of cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 

|AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
|P644L | Missense | rs774359263 |
|G325E | Missense | rs1057522036 |

|H651R | Missense | rs202030265 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
No somatic mutations are currently listed in dbSNP.

**Related Disease:** 
Mutations in the CUL5 gene have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called 3M syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by severe growth retardation, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
Currently, there is no cure for 3M syndrome and treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms.

**Drug Response:** 
No drugs have been specifically developed to target CUL5 mutations in 3M syndrome.
