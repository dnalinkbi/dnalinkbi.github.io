## Gene: RAB27A

### *Genetic Position*
RAB27A is a protein coding gene located on chromosome 15q21.3. Its genomic location spans from 67,253,765 to 67,296,686 bp.

### *Function*
RAB27A encodes a member of the small GTPase superfamily, responsible for the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking and secretion in various cell types. It plays a crucial role in melanosome transport, platelet exocytosis, cytotoxic T lymphocyte degranulation, and lytic granule release in natural killer cells.

### *External IDs and Aliases*
Some of the external IDs and aliases for RAB27A are:
- HGNC ID: 9784
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 5873
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000137868
- OMIM ID: 603868
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O15379
- Aliases: ASH, GS2, RAM, RAM1, RP22

### *AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID*
Several missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations have been reported in the RAB27A gene. Some of them are:
- p.Glu62Lys (rs74315315)
- p.Glu64Lys (rs74315314)
- p.Arg77Cys (rs74315313)
- p.Gly77Val (rs74315312)
- p.Lys85Glu (rs74315311)

### *Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID*
Somatic SNVs/InDels in RAB27A with dbSNP ID are currently not available.

### *Related Diseases*
Mutations in the RAB27A gene are associated with several diseases, including:
- Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS2)
- Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2)
- Oculocutaneous albinism type 7 (OCA7)

### *Treatment and Prognosis*
Treatment for RAB27A-related disorders mainly involves symptomatic support, while some patients may benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The prognosis varies greatly depending on the severity of the disease.

### *Drug Response*
Information about drug response and RAB27A is currently not available.
