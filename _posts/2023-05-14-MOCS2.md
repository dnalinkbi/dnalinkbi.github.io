## Gene: MOCS2

### Function 
MOCS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor (Moco), which is essential for several enzymes involved in cellular metabolism.

### Related Diseases 
- Molybdenum cofactor deficiency
- Sulfite oxidase deficiency 

### Treatment and Prognosis 
There is no cure for Molybdenum cofactor deficiency and sulfite oxidase deficiency, only supportive care is available. In some cases, supplementation with high doses of cPMP (cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate) can be helpful. The prognosis for these diseases is generally poor, and early onset of symptoms is often fatal.

### Drug Response 
There is no specific drug available for Molybdenum cofactor deficiency and sulfite oxidase deficiency treatment.
