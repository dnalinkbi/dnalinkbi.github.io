# Information about SH2B3 Gene

SH2B3, also known as LNK, is a protein-coding gene that is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q24.12. This gene plays an important role in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis, immune regulation, and cancer development.

## Function of SH2B3 gene

SH2B3 gene acts as a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for the normal development and function of various immune cells, including T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Through its interactions with various tyrosine kinases and signal transducers, SH2B3 prevents the excessive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and thereby controls the differentiation, survival, and activation of different immune cell types.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several known mutations in the SH2B3 gene that have been associated with various human disorders. Some of the most common ones are:

- c.1458G>A (p.Arg486His) - rs3184504
- c.664A>G (p.Tyr222Cys) - rs35011626
- c.172_175delAAGT (p.Glu58SerfsTer6) - rs398123286

These mutations are all single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the SH2B3 protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations that have been reported in the SH2B3 gene, particularly in different types of leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors. Some of the common SNVs and InDels with dbSNP ID are:

- c.354_355delAG (p.Arg118GlnfsTer25) - rs11554287
- c.553A>G (p.Tyr185Cys) - rs138971654
- c.1198G>A (p.Arg400Gln) - rs72545469
- c.1321A>T (p.Gln441Leu) - rs13047329

## Related disease

Mutations and deregulation of SH2B3 gene have been associated with various human disorders, including autoimmune diseases (e.g. type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus), blood disorders (e.g. leukemias, lymphomas), and heart diseases (e.g. hypertension, atherosclerosis). In particular, loss-of-function mutations in SH2B3 gene have been found to increase the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis of SH2B3-related disorders depend on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms. In general, most autoimmune diseases are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, and rituximab. MPNs and CLL may require more aggressive therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplantation. The prognosis of SH2B3-related disorders also varies greatly depending on the disease and the stage at which it is diagnosed.

## Drug response

There is limited information available regarding the drug response of SH2B3-related disorders. However, recent studies have shown that targeting the JAK-STAT pathway with inhibitors such as ruxolitinib can be effective for treating certain autoimmune diseases and blood disorders that are associated with SH2B3 deregulation.
