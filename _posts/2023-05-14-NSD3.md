## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** NSD3 (Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 3)

**Function:** NSD3 is a histone methyltransferase that specifically methylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36), a histone modification associated with gene transcription and repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 8q24.3

**Aliases:** WHSC1L1, PP1438, FLJ23395, dJ174L15.1

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 24697
- NCBI Entrez: 7468
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125691
- OMIM: 606152
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H7B4

**AA Mutation List:**
- p.Arg1014Gln (rs74798823)
- p.Arg1225Cys (rs200745986)
- p.Asp1549Tyr (rs143926215)
- p.Ala1543Pro (rs281865160)

**Mutation Type:** Missense Variation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
- c.A1190T (p.Pro397Ser)
- c.C2366T (p.Pro789Leu)
- c.G2411A (p.Ala804Thr)
- c.G2497C (p.Gly833Arg)

**Related Disease:** NSD3 mutations and overexpression have been observed in various cancer types, including gastric cancer, breast cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The overexpression of NSD3 can lead to a poor prognosis in cancer patients. There are currently no specific treatments for NSD3-related cancers.

**Drug Response:** NSD3 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, and there are ongoing studies investigating NSD3 inhibitors.
