# Information about gene SERPINA1

## Genetic position 
- SERPINA1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at position 14q32.1.

## Function for gene
- SERPINA1 encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein synthesized in the liver and secreted into the blood. It plays a role in protecting tissues from proteolytic damage by regulating the activity of neutrophil elastase and other proteases.
 
## External IDs and Aliases 
- Gene ID: 5265
- Genomic Location: chr14:95,840,622-95,852,398
- Aliases: AAT, PI, A1A, PRO2275, alpha1AT

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- Several mutations in the SERPINA1 gene have been implicated in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Some of the common mutations with their dbSNP IDs are listed below:
  - E366K (rs61755374)
  - S53F (rs17580)
  - M1T (rs28929474)
  - Ile105Val (rs28931594)
  - E288V (rs28931595)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported for SERPINA1 in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
- Mutations in SERPINA1 are primarily associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which is a genetic disorder that can lead to lung and liver disease. 

## Treatment and prognosis
- The treatment of AATD primarily involves symptom management, such as bronchodilators and antibiotics for lung infections. Lung transplantation may be necessary in severe cases. 
- The prognosis of AATD varies depending on the severity of the disease. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes.

## Drug response
- There are currently no drugs specifically targeted to treat AATD, but some drugs developed for other conditions such as COPD may help alleviate symptoms.
