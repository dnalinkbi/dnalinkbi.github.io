## Information about gene PHC1:

- **Genetic Position:** PHC1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 at the position 6p21.31.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the PHC1 gene have been associated with various forms of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia, esophageal cancer, and glioblastoma.

- **Function for gene:** PHC1 gene encodes a component of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which plays an essential role in gene silencing and chromatin remodeling during embryonic development and tumorigenesis.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
    - HGNC ID: 8953
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 5252
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000112164
    - OMIM ID: 605071
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O75530
    - Aliases: PH1, PHC, MEL18, NCYM, and NSPc1.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are various nonsynonymous mutations reported in the PHC1 gene with their relevant dbSNP IDs. Some of the notable mutations include: 
    - R197H (rs200418063)
    - R365W (rs752739218)
    - R434W (rs767902689)
    - L548V (rs142408842)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Various somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the PHC1 gene with their relevant dbSNP IDs, such as: 
    - chr6:32179924:C>A (rs760131034)
    - chr6:32176973:T>C (rs769620117)
    - chr6:32175291:C>T (rs55940987)

- **Related Disease:** PHC1 gene mutations have been associated with the risk of developing several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia, esophageal cancer, and glioblastoma.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** As PHC1 gene mutations are associated with cancer, the treatment and prognosis of the disease depend on various factors such as cancer type, stage, and individual patient factors. 

- **Drug Response:** The drug response in patients with PHC1 gene mutations remains unclear and requires further investigation.
