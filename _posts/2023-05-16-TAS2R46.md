# Gene Information Analysis: TAS2R46 Gene

## Summary
The TAS2R46 gene encodes a member of the taste receptor family, which is present on the tongue and other taste receptor cells in the mouth. This gene is located on chromosome 12q23.2 and its external IDs are as follows: 
- HGNC ID: 11710
- NCBI Entrez ID: 259310
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000133544
- OMIM ID: 611857
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6IWK6

## Function
The TAS2R46 gene encodes a bitter taste receptor. Its exact function is not well-understood but it is thought to play a role in the detection of bitter compounds in the mouth.

## AA Mutation List
There are several reported AA mutations in the TAS2R46 gene, including:
- R102Q (rs2287497)
- M357T (rs61767216)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the TAS2R46 gene.

## Related Disease
