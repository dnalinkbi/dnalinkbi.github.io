## Gene: HP (Haptoglobin)

### Information:

- Function: The HP gene encodes for a protein called haptoglobin which binds free hemoglobin in plasma and prevents kidney damage due to hemoglobin leakage.
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 3240
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 16 (16q22.2)
    - Aliases: HPA, MGC111106
    
- External sites:
    - HGNC: 5163
    - NCBI Entrez: 3240
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000267662
    - OMIM: 140100
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P00738
    
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.131A>G (p.Asn44Ser) rs139376976
    - c.456G>A (p.Ala152Thr) rs200099965

- Related disease: 
    - Hemolytic anemia due to HP deficiency
    - Diabetes mellitus
    - Cardiovascular disease
    - Cancer
    - Inflammatory disorders
    
- Treatment and prognosis:
    - Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the disease associated with HP deficiency, such as blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and immunosuppressive drugs.
    - Prognosis is also dependent on the associated disease.
    
- Drug response:
    - The HP genotype may influence response to certain drugs, such as antihypertensive agents and statins.
