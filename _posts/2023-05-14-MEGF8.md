# Gene: MEGF8

**Function for Gene:** 

MEGF8 gene encodes a protein that belongs to a family of transmembrane glycoproteins involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. MEGF8 protein is responsible for the development of different organs in the human body, such as the brain, heart, and limbs.
