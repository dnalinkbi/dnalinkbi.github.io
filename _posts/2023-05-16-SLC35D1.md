# Gene Information for SLC35D1 

## Genetic Position
The SLC35D1 gene is mapped to chromosome 5 and is located at position 5q22.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in SLC35D1 gene have been associated with developmental disorders as well as cancer. A recent study has shown that somatic mutations in SLC35D1 gene may contribute to liver carcinogenesis. 

## Function
The SLC35D1 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the nucleotide-sugar transporter family. This protein is involved in the transport of UDP-glucose into the endoplasmic reticulum, a process that is essential for proper protein glycosylation.

## Related Disease
SLC35D1 mutations have been associated with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and hepatic carcinoma. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for SLC35D1-related developmental disorders yet. As for liver cancer, the prognosis is generally poor, and treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy.

## Drug Response
Currently, there is no known drug specifically targeting SLC35D1.
