# Gene SETX

## Information
- **Pathology:** SETX gene is associated with the development of several neurodegenerative disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia type 2 (AOA2), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2).
- **Function:** SETX encodes for a DNA/RNA helicase protein called Senataxin that plays a major role in maintaining RNA integrity and transcriptional regulation. It also repairs DNA damage and contributes to the suppression of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 10704
    - NCBI Entrez: 23064
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105382
    - OMIM: 608465
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q7Z333
- **Aliases:** ALS4, AOA2, CMT2A, SCAR1.
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 9q34.13.
