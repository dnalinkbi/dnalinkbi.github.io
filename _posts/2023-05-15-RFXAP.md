# Information on Gene RFXAP

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The RFXAP gene, also known as Regulatory Factor X-Associated Protein, is located on chromosome 13q13.3. Mutations in this gene have been associated with MHC class II deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the immune system. The RFXAP protein is involved in the regulation of transcription of major histocompatibility complex class II genes which are important for proper immune function.

## Function for Gene
The RFXAP protein is a transcription factor that binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates the expression of genes involved in immune function. Specifically, it is involved in the regulation of MHC class II genes, which present antigens to T cells and are important for recognizing foreign invaders and mounting an immune response.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the RFXAP gene associated with MHC class II deficiency. These include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. Some examples include:

- c.266C>T (p.Arg89Ter) rs199747125
- c.686G>A (p.Glu229Lys) rs587777413
- c.791C>A (p.Thr264Asn) rs587777414

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the RFXAP gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the RFXAP gene are associated with MHC class II deficiency, a rare disorder characterized by impaired immune function and recurrent infections. Symptoms can vary widely, but often include susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MHC class II deficiency, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing infections with prompt antibiotic treatment. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the mutations and the individual's ability to manage infections.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeted towards treating MHC class II deficiency, but antibiotics and other medications can be used to treat and prevent infections.
