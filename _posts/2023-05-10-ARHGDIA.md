# Information about Gene ARHGDIA

## Genetic Position
The ARHGDIA gene is located on chromosome 17q25.3, from base pair position 77,038,000 to 77,054,231.

## Pathology 
Mutations in the ARHGDIA gene have been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, immune disorders, and neurological disorders.

## Function
The ARHGDIA gene encodes the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha protein, which is involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. These proteins play crucial roles in a variety of cellular processes, including cell division, cell adhesion, and cell migration.
