## Gene information for GCGR

### Gene Function
The GCGR gene encodes for the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed in the liver and involved in regulating glucose homeostasis. 

### Gene Location and External IDs
- Gene ID: 2642
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17q25.3
- Aliases: GLR, GLR1, GCGR1, GGR

### External Sites
- HGNC: 4291
- NCBI Entrez: 2642
- Ensembl: ENSG00000141510
- OMIM: 138032
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P47871

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No pathogenic mutations have been identified in the GCGR gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations have been reported in the GCGR gene.

### Related Diseases
- Mutations in the GCGR gene have not been identified as causing any disease. However, aberrant activation of the glucagon receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- The glucagon receptor is a potential target for the treatment of diabetes, and several drugs that modulate its activity are currently in development.

### Drug Response
- Several drugs that target the glucagon receptor are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of diabetes, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule agonists and antagonists.
