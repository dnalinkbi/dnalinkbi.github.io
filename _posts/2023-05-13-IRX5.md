# Gene: IRX5
## Information
* **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 16: 82,195,586 - 82,228,410
* **Aliases**: IRXB2, IRXA4, IRO5
* **Function**: The IRX5 gene codes for Iroquois-class homeodomain proteins that play a role in developmental processes. IRX5 has been implicated in the development of the heart, brain, and limb.
