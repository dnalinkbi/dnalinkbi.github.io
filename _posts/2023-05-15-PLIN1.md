# Gene PLIN1

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- PLIN1 is located on chromosome 15q26.1.
- Pathologically, mutations in this gene have been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome.

## Function
- The protein encoded by PLIN1 is called perilipin-1, which is primarily expressed in adipose tissue, where it plays a key role in lipid storage and metabolism.
- Perilipin-1 functions as a coating protein on the surface of lipid droplets, which are the primary sites of intracellular triglyceride storage.
- The protein regulates lipolysis by controlling the access of lipases to stored triglycerides.
