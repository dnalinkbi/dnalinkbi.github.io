# Information about Gene AHR

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** The AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) gene is located on chromosome 7 (7p21.1) in humans.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the AHR gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, asthma, and cardiovascular disease.
- **Function:** The AHR gene encodes a protein that acts as a transcription factor and plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli such as toxins, pollutants, and certain foods.

## Gene Information

- **Function:** AHR mediates the cellular response to xenobiotics and has important functions in the regulation of immune, respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
- **External IDs:**
    - Gene: AHR
    - Genomic Location: 7p21.1
    - Aliases: AHRL1, bHLHe76, AHR1, bHLHe76

- Asthma
- Cardiovascular disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for AHR gene mutations. The prognosis for individuals with AHR-related diseases varies depending on the specific condition and the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response

Certain drugs, such as dioxin and some aromatic hydrocarbons, are known to activate the AHR pathway. Additionally, some drugs have been developed to target the AHR pathway for therapeutic purposes.
