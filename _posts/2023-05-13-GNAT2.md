# GNAT2

GNAT2 is a gene located on chromosome 1 at position 1p13.1. It encodes the protein G protein subunit alpha transducin 2. This gene is involved in the visual phototransduction cascade by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP in response to light-induced activation of rhodopsin.

## Function for gene

The GNAT2 gene plays a crucial role in the phototransduction cascade. It is responsible for the activation of the cGMP phosphodiesterase of rod cells in response to light stimulation, leading to the hydrolysis of cGMP and the closure of cGMP-gated channels.
