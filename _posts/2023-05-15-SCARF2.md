# Gene: SCARF2

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: 22
- Location: 22q11.2-q12.1

## Pathology
- Related disease: Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Mutation type: Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variations (CNVs)
- Function: Plays a role in neural development, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity.

## Function
SCARF2 encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including neural development, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity. The protein is expressed throughout the central nervous system during embryonic development and regulates the migration of neurons and the growth of axons.
