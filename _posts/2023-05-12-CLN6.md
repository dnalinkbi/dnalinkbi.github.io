# Gene CLN6

## Basic information

### Gene Position

The gene CLN6 is located on chromosome 15q21.2.

### Aliases

This gene is also known as:

- Battenin
- KIAA0941

### External IDs

The external IDs for gene CLN6 are:

- HGNC: 18356
- NCBI Entrez: 2420
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171790
- OMIM: 601780
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UM58

## Function

The protein encoded by the CLN6 gene is a transmembrane protein that is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. It plays a crucial role in lysosomal function and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD).

Symptoms associated with mutations in CLN6 usually arise in early childhood and typically involve neurodegeneration, seizures, loss of vision and motor skills, and cognitive impairment.


## Mutations and Variants

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

The CLN6 gene has several known mutations that lead to disease. Here are some of the common amino acid (AA) mutations with their corresponding mutation type and dbSNP ID:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|p.D418N|Missense|rs398122224|
|p.R278H|Missense|rs121918299|
|p.L205P|Missense|rs121918298|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic variants for the CLN6 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CLN6 gene are associated with a type of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) called late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), also known as CLN6 disease. This disease results in a progressive loss of physical ability, loss of vision, and cognitive decline. The onset of symptoms usually occurs between ages 2 and 4.


## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for CLN6 disease. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. Management of seizures is often a primary focus of treatment, along with supportive therapy such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.

## Drug response

There are currently no drugs specifically targeted for CLN6 disease. However, a clinical trial named "A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of UX003 Recombinant Human CLN6 for the Treatment of CLN6 Disease." is ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of a drug called UX003, which is a recombinant form of human CLN6, in patients with CLN6 disease.
