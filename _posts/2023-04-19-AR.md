# Gene AR

## Genetic Position
The AR gene is located on the X chromosome at Xq11-12.

## Pathology
Mutations in the AR gene are associated with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), a condition where individuals with male chromosomes (XY) have impaired male sexual development and may have female or ambiguous genitalia.

## Function
The AR gene encodes the androgen receptor, a protein that binds to androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The androgen receptor plays a crucial role in male sexual development and function, as well as in the growth and progression of prostate cancer.

## Related Disease
- Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for AIS may involve hormone therapy or surgery to correct any physical abnormalities. Prostate cancer treatment may involve surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the stage and severity of the cancer.

## Drug Response
Mutations in the AR gene can affect the response to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.
