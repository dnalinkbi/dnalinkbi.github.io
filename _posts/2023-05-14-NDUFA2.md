# Information about Gene NDUFA2

## Genetic Position
The NDUFA2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome X (Xq24). It spans a genomic region of approximately 8.65 kb.

## Pathology
Mutations in the NDUFA2 gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure.

## Function
The NDUFA2 gene encodes a subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is involved in the first step of the electron transport chain. This complex oxidizes NADH and transfers electrons to ubiquinone, creating a proton gradient that is used to generate ATP in the mitochondrial matrix. Complex I is composed of 45 subunits, and mutations in any of these subunits can result in complex I deficiency.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no known association of somatic SNVs/InDels with the NDUFA2 gene at this time.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the NDUFA2 gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (OMIM 300579), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency at the present time. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive, with a focus on addressing the specific symptoms presented by the individual patient. Prognosis of mitochondrial complex I deficiency can vary widely depending on the severity of the disorder and the specific symptoms experienced by the patient.

## Drug Response
There is no established drug therapy for mitochondrial complex I deficiency.
