## Gene: SPTBN1 

- **Function for gene:** SPTBN1 (Spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1) encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, migration, and polarity. It crosslinks actin filaments with integral membrane proteins and is important in membrane organization and dynamics.
