## Gene: LSS

### Genetic position
LSS (lanosterol synthase) is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 at position q22.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the LSS gene are associated with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual disability. 

### Function
LSS is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a key step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. 

### External IDs
- Gene ID: 4048
- Genomic location: chr21:46,102,812-46,111,154
- Aliases: SS, SLOS2, OSCDS

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Thr93Met (rs2228066)
- p.Ala133Thr (rs74394972)
- p.Tyr114Cys (rs74394971)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the LSS gene.

### Related disease
LSS mutations are associated with the rare genetic disorder Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no known cure for SLOS, but treatment may include dietary changes, cholesterol supplements, and symptomatic management of various physical and intellectual disabilities associated with the syndrome.

### Drug response
Studies have shown that LSS inhibitors may have potential therapeutic applications in treating diseases where cholesterol biosynthesis plays a role, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, more research is needed in this area.
