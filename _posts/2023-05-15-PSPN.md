# Information about Gene PSPN

## Genetic Position
PSPN is a gene located on chromosome 19q13.12 between nucleotides 37,947,521 and 37,954,432 (GRCh38.p13).

## Pathology 
PSPN is associated with several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. Mutations or aberrant expression of this gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders and impaired neural function.

## Function 
PSPN encodes for Prosaposin, a protein that plays a crucial role in lysosomal metabolism and neuroprotection. Prosaposin is a precursor protein that gets cleaved into four sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins A-D) that are involved in lipid metabolism, cell growth, and differentiation. Additionally, it functions as a neurotrophic factor, aiding in neural survival and development.
