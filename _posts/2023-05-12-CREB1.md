## Gene: CREB1

### Genetic position, Pathology, and Function

CREB1 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1) is a gene located on chromosome 2q34. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor that binds to cAMP response elements (CREs) and regulates gene expression in response to a variety of signals. The CREB1 gene is associated with several diseases, including cancer, depression, and addiction.

### Function for Gene 

The CREB1 gene plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is involved in a wide range of biological processes, including learning and memory, circadian rhythms, glucose metabolism, and immune function.

The CREB1 gene is located on chromosome 2q34.

Aliases: CREB, CREB-1, CREBBP, MGC9284

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid mutations associated with the CREB1 gene. The following is a list of mutations and their associated dbSNP IDs:

- R173S (rs72552720)
- P344S (rs34791152)
- C356S (rs2275373)
- R404H (rs74315348)
- E418K (rs61732341)
- G430S (rs375015190)

These mutations are mostly missense mutations that result in the alteration of a single amino acid in the CREB1 protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs and InDels associated with the CREB1 gene. The following is a list of mutations and their associated dbSNP IDs:

- c.316+1G>A (rs1426880105)
- c.1793C>T (rs1483257332)
- c.795A>T (rs1509265283)

These somatic mutations are associated with various types of cancers, including melanoma and breast cancer.

### Related Disease

The CREB1 gene is associated with several diseases, including cancer, depression, addiction, and schizophrenia. Some studies have also found a link between CREB1 gene expression and Alzheimer's disease.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for genetic mutations in the CREB1 gene. However, some drugs that target CREB1 signaling are being developed for the treatment of certain types of cancer. The prognosis for individuals with CREB1 gene mutations depends on several factors, including the type of mutation and the associated disease.

### Drug Response

Studies have shown that drugs that target CREB1 signaling may be effective in the treatment of certain types of cancer. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential of these drugs.
