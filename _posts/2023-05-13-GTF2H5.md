# Information on Gene GTF2H5

## Genetic Position
The GTF2H5 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at position 24.3 (6p24.3).

## Pathology and Function
The GTF2H5 gene encodes a component of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) which is involved in DNA repair and transcription initiation. Mutations in GTF2H5 have been associated with various skin disorders, including xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms of the associated skin disorders as there is currently no cure for any of the conditions associated with mutations in GTF2H5. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specific to mutations in GTF2H5.
