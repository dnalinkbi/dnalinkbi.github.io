# Information about gene RABEP1

### Genetic position and aliases
- **Gene symbol**: RABEP1
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 17q12
- **Aliases**: KIAA0941, RABPT5, RAB7TIF

### Function
RABEP1 encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle transport. It acts as a effector protein for the small GTPase RAB7, which is implicated in endocytic trafficking and autophagy. RABEP1 is thought to play a role in tethering vesicles to target membranes and has also been suggested to be involved in cargo selection and fusion.
