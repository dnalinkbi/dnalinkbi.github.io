# Information about gene USP8

## Genetic position
The USP8 gene is located on chromosome 15q21.1. It spans a total of 68,464 base pairs and is oriented in the sense strand direction.

## Pathology
Mutations in USP8 have been linked to the development of Cushing's disease, a rare endocrine disorder characterized by excessive cortisol production. Specifically, somatic mutations affecting the hotspot codon 41 (p.Pro41Leu, p.Pro41Ser) have been identified in pituitary adenomas from patients with Cushing's disease. These mutations cause increased deubiquitinating activity of the USP8 enzyme, resulting in elevated levels of EGFR signaling and cortisol production.

## Function
The USP8 gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a key role in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and DNA repair. Specifically, USP8 is involved in the deubiquitination and stabilization of several key signaling molecules, including EGFR and TGFÎ² receptors.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Pro41Leu (rs140993358)
- p.Pro41Ser (rs149202270)

Both mutations affect the same codon 41 and lead to increased deubiquitinating activity of the USP8 enzyme, resulting in elevated levels of EGFR signaling and cortisol production.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.122C>T (rs140993358)
- c.121C>G (rs149202270)

Both somatic mutations affect the same nucleotide position and result in the same amino acid substitutions (p.Pro41Leu and p.Pro41Ser).

## Related disease
Cushing's disease

## Treatment and prognosis
The current standard of treatment for Cushing's disease involves surgical removal of the pituitary tumor responsible for the excessive cortisol production. However, in cases where surgery is not possible or unsuccessful, medical therapy with drugs such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, or pasireotide may be used to control cortisol levels. The prognosis for Cushing's disease is generally good with appropriate treatment.

## Drug response
Recent studies have identified USP8 as a potential target for the treatment of EGFR-driven cancers, such as glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. In these cancers, USP8 inhibitors may be used to decrease EGFR signaling and inhibit tumor growth.
