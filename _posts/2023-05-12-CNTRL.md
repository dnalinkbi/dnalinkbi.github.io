## Gene CNTRL

### Genetic Position

The CNTRL gene is located on chromosome 9q34.3.

### Pathology

The CNTRL gene has been associated with multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations in this gene have also been linked to the development of glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer.

### Function for gene

The CNTRL gene encodes a protein called centriolin, which plays a role in cell division and the formation of the centrosome. The centrosome is a structure found in cells that helps to organize the microtubules involved in cell division.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the CNTRL gene have been linked to the development of glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no established treatment or cure for glioblastoma, and patients generally have a poor prognosis. However, research into new treatments and therapies for glioblastoma is ongoing.

### Drug Response

Research has shown that certain drugs, such as the kinase inhibitor dasatinib, may be effective in treating glioblastoma tumors with CNTRL mutations.
