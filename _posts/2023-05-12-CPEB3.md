# Information about gene CPEB3

## Genetic position, Pathology, and Function
The CPEB3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q25.1). It encodes the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein 3 (CPEB3), which is a RNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation. CPEB3 regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and long-term memory formation. Aberrant expression of CPEB3 has been associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and depression.

## Function
The CPEB3 protein binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs and, in conjunction with other factors, modulates the polyadenylation and translation of mRNA molecules in neurons. This regulation is critical for proper synaptic development and plasticity, as well as memory consolidation.

## External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location
- External IDs: HGNC:24970, NCBI Entrez:80176, Ensembl:ENSG00000144311, OMIM:611174, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q8NB56
- Aliases: CPE-BP3, CPE-binding protein 3
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 15q25.1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Some of the mutations reported in the CPEB3 gene include:
- c.937G>A (p.Asp313Asn), missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs140618568
- c.1093C>T (p.Arg365Ter), nonsense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs377523563
- c.641+1G>A, splice variant, not available in dbSNP

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in CPEB3 have not been extensively studied. Therefore, there are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID associated with any specific disease.

## Related diseases
Aberrant expression of CPEB3 has been associated with neurological disorders such as:
- Alzheimer's disease
- Epilepsy
- Depression

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for neurological disorders associated with CPEB3 dysregulation. Treatment strategies aim to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life of patients. 
The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder, severity, and progression of the disease.

## Drug response
There are no approved drugs that target CPEB3 specifically. However, some drugs, such as memantine, have been used to treat Alzheimer's disease, with some evidence of a therapeutic effect on CPEB3-mediated synaptic dysfunction.
