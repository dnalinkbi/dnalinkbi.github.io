# Information about gene SERPINI2

## Genetic Position
The gene SERPINI2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 14.3 (3q13.33).

## Pathology
There is limited information on the pathology of SERPINI2. However, studies have shown that it is involved in the regulation of several physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity, angiogenesis, and inflammation.

## Function
SERPINI2 encodes a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. The protein is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, which is important for learning and memory. In addition, SERPINI2 has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis and inflammation.
