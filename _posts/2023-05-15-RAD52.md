## Gene: RAD52

### Pathology
RAD52 gene is associated with cancer. A study by Jia et al. in 2020 found that RAD52 overexpression promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. 

### Function
RAD52 plays a crucial role in DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination. It mediates the annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA to form a joint molecule and also stimulates the DNA strand exchange reaction between homologous DNA strands.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: 9789
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 5893
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000112740
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 12q24.33
- Aliases: SFS2, RAD59

### Mutation and SNP Information
- AA Mutation: c.617G>A (p.Gly206Arg)
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs1051669
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: Not available 

### Related Diseases
RAD52 mutations have been found to be associated with multiple cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Various cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies, have been developed to target mutated RAD52 in cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of these treatments varies based on the type and stage of cancer.

### Drug Response
Studies have shown that RAD52 inhibition can lead to increased sensitivity to certain cancer drugs, such as PARP inhibitors, and can also enhance the effect of radiation therapy in cancer treatment.
