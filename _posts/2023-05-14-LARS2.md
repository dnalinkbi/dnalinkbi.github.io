## Gene: LARS2

### Gene Function:

The LARS2 gene encodes for the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the covalent linkage of leucine to its cognate tRNA during protein synthesis.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There are currently no reported somatic mutations for the LARS2 gene.

### Related Disease:

Mutations in the LARS2 gene have been associated with Perrault syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the ovaries and hearing.

### Treatment and Prognosis:

There is currently no specific treatment for Perrault syndrome. Patients are provided with supportive care to address their individual symptoms.

### Drug Response:

There is currently no reported drug response for patients with Perrault syndrome due to LARS2 mutations.
