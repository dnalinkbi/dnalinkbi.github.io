# Information about gene GNB4

## Genetic Position
Chromosome: 3  
Genomic Coordinates (GRCh38): 3q26.33  
Genomic Coordinates (GRCh37): 3q26.33  

## Pathology
Mutations in GNB4 have been associated with numerous diseases, including:  
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 4D (CMT4D)
- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 17 (CORD17)
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 13 (ALS13)

## Function
GNB4 encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) subunit beta-4. The beta subunits of G proteins function as regulators of adenylyl cyclase activity, and mediate signal transduction pathways. Additionally, GNB4 has been shown to play a role in the regulation of ion channels and actin filaments.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic variants have been reported in GNB4.

## Related Disease
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 4D (CMT4D)
    - Inherited neuromuscular disorder affecting the peripheral nerves
    - Symptoms include muscle weakness and wasting, decreased sensitivity to touch, and foot deformities
- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 17 (CORD17)
    - Inherited retinal disorder affecting the cone and rod cells of the retina
    - Symptoms include decreased visual acuity, color vision defects, and blindness
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 13 (ALS13)
    - Neurodegenerative disorder affecting the motor neurons
    - Symptoms include muscle weakness and atrophy, difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for the diseases associated with GNB4 mutations. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms of the disease. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeted to GNB4 mutations.
