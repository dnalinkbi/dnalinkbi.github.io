# Information about gene HGSNAT

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Gene Name:** HGSNAT (Heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase)
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 8, q11.1
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the HGSNAT gene cause Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome C. This is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that affects the degradation of heparan sulfate in the lysosome. Accumulation of undegraded heparan sulfate causes cellular and organ dysfunction leading to neurological and behavioral symptoms, and ultimately death in early adulthood.
- **Function:** HGSNAT encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to glucosamine residues in the degradation pathway of heparan sulfate.

## Gene and Genomic Location

- **HGNC ID:** 12668
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 6598
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000178486
- **OMIM ID:** 610453
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q68CP6
- **Aliases:** MPS3C, FLJ20632, HGSNAT1, MGC104255

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the HGSNAT gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease

- Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome C.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for MPS IIIC, and treatment options focus on symptom management and improving quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy has been unsuccessful in treating MPS IIIC because HGSNAT is located in the lysosome, which is difficult to target with enzyme replacement therapy. Gene therapy is being investigated as a potential treatment option. Prognosis for MPS IIIC is poor, with most patients dying in early adolescence or adulthood.

## Drug Response

There is currently no drug that is approved specifically for the treatment of MPS IIIC. Several drugs are under investigation, including substrate reduction therapy, which aims to reduce the accumulation of heparan sulfate by inhibiting its production.
