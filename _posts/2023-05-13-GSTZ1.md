## Gene GSTZ1

### Genetic Position

Gene GSTZ1 is located on chromosome 14q24.3 and its genetic position is chr14:73259041-73263960.

### Pathology

GSTZ1 is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene and its dysfunction may have a role in the development of certain types of cancers, such as breast, prostate, and liver cancer.

### Function for Gene

GSTZ1 encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase zeta 1, which is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and the metabolism of reactive oxygen species.
