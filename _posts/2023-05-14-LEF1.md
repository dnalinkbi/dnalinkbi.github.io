# Analysis of LEF1 gene

LEF1 is a gene located on chromosome 4q25 and encodes for a lymphoid enhancer-binding factor protein. This gene plays a crucial role in development and differentiation, particularly in the Wnt signaling pathway. The following information is analyzed for the LEF1 gene:

## Function
LEF1 plays a central role in Wnt signaling pathway. It enters the nucleus and forms a complex with beta-catenin to activate gene transcription. It also regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: 6546
- NCBI Entrez ID: 51176
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000130164
- OMIM ID: 153245
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9UJU2
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 4q25

Aliases: TCF10, TCF-10, TCF7L3, TCF-7L3, LFB1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several LEF1 mutations have been reported. Some of the AA mutations along with their type and dbSNP ID are listed below:
- c.799A>T  (missense) rs78973949
- c.425C>T (missense) rs794727280
- c.248T>C (missense) rs794727279 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some of the somatic LEF1 mutations with dbSNP ID are:
- rs782644896
- rs80338747
- rs782660287

## Related Disease
LEF1 mutations have been associated with various cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and leukemia. Several studies suggest that LEF1 plays a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment of cancer with LEF1 mutations is still in the experimental stage. However, several drugs targeting the Wnt signaling pathway are being developed, which could potentially be used to treat LEF1-linked cancers.

## Drug response
LEF1 is known to be sensitive to drugs targeting the Wnt signaling pathway, including LGK-974 and PRI-724.
