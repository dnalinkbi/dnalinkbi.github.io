# Gene SMG1

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** 16p13.3
- **Pathology:** SMG1 is associated with the regulation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and DNA damage response pathways.
- **Function for gene:** SMG1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates several proteins involved in RNA processing and DNA damage response pathways. It has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - **Gene ID:** 23049
    - **Genomic Location:** Chr16:3,667,885-3,798,695
    - **Aliases:** HsapF1ALPHA, hSMG-1, SMG1L, KIAA0429

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** A comprehensive list of AA mutations and their corresponding descriptions for SMG1 is not available on the current genomic databases.
- **Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:** SMG1 has several reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the general population. dbSNP ID and mutation type of some of the common SNPs in SMG1 are:
    - rs2303424, SNP
    - rs8042709, SNP

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in SMG1 have been linked with several diseases such as:
    - Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome
    - Fanconi Anemia
    - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
    - Colorectal Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with SMG1 mutation vary depending on the severity and progression of the disease. However, ongoing research may provide new therapeutic options in the future.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response specific to SMG1. More research is needed to investigate the potential therapeutic strategies targeting SMG1.
