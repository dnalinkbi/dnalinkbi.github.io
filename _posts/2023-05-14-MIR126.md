## Gene Information

MIR126 is a microRNA gene located on chromosome 9p24.1 in humans. It is a small non-coding RNA gene that produces the miR-126 microRNA.

## Function

miR-126 is involved in many biological processes, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and cell migration. It is a tumor suppressor that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. It also plays a role in cardiovascular development and maintenance of the endothelial barrier.
