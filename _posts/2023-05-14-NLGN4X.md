## Gene Information

**Gene:** NLGN4X

**Pathology:** NLGN4X gene mutations or deletions have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability.

**Function:** The NLGN4X gene encodes a protein called neuroligin-4, which is involved in the formation and organization of synaptic connections between neurons in the brain.

**External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Locations:**
- HGNC: 7807
- NCBI Entrez: 57502
- Ensembl: ENSG00000102974
- OMIM: 300427
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N2Q7
- Genomic location: Xq13.1

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- c.55G>A (p.Val19Met) rs137853224
- c.653T>C (p.Ser218Pro) rs137853225
- c.1567G>A (p.Arg523Gln) rs398123337

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- None reported so far.

**Related Diseases:** Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** No cure is currently available for ASD or intellectual disability caused by NLGN4X mutations. Treatment aims to improve symptoms, behavior, and cognitive abilities through medication, behavioral therapies, and educational programs.

**Drug Response:** Some drugs used to treat ASD symptoms include antipsychotics, antidepressants, and stimulants. However, drug response can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their symptoms.
