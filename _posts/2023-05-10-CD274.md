# Gene CD274

### Introduction

CD274 is a gene that encodes the protein programed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). This protein plays an important role in the immune system by suppressing the activity of T cells, which helps prevent the immune system from attacking healthy cells in the body.

### Function

The protein encoded by CD274 interacts with PD-1, which is a receptor on the surface of T cells. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, it sends a signal to the T cell to inhibit its activity. This process helps regulate the immune response and prevent uncontrolled inflammation.

- rs4143816 (G238C)

### Related Disease

The overexpression of PD-L1 has been observed in multiple types of cancers, including lung, melanoma, bladder, and renal cell carcinoma. This suggests that blocking the PD-L1 pathway could help improve the anti-tumor immune response. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

Targeted therapy drugs aimed at blocking PD-L1 and PD-1 can be effective in treating cancer patients with high PD-L1 levels. Some known drugs include pembrolizumab and nivolumab. However, not all patients respond to this type of therapy, and the long-term prognosis is still unclear. 

### Drug Response

Studies have shown that patients with higher levels of PD-L1 expression in their tumor cells are more likely to respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition therapy. However, there are cases where patients with low PD-L1 expression still respond well to treatment.
