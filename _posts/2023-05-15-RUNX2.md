## Gene RUNX2 information

- **Genetic position**: The gene RUNX2 is located on chromosome 6, specifically on the 6p21.1-p12 region.

- **Pathology**: Mutations in the RUNX2 gene are associated with skeletal dysplasia, cleidocranial dysplasia, and osteoporosis.

- **Function**: The RUNX2 gene encodes for a transcription factor called runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). This protein plays a crucial role in the differentiation and maturation of bone cells.

- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene: HGNC:10455
    - Genomic location: NCBI, Ensembl
    - Aliases: CBFA1, AML3, PEA2-alphaA

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - c.178C>T (p.Arg60*)
    - c.449G>A (p.Gly150Asp), rs121908907
    - c.527G>A (p.Arg176His), rs121908908
    - c.608G>A (p.Glu203Lys), rs786205707

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
    - rs12635832 (c.133A>G)
    - rs70623566 (c.332G>T)
    - rs764786296 (c.637C>G)

- **Related disease**: RUNX2 mutations are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia, a skeletal disorder characterized by delayed growth, skeletal abnormalities, and dental issues. Somatic mutations in RUNX2 have been reported in various types of cancer, including breast and prostate cancer.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: Management of cleidocranial dysplasia involves dental care, speech therapy, and orthopedic procedures to correct bone abnormalities. Currently, there is no curative treatment for the disease. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of skeletal abnormalities.

- **Drug response**: There is no approved drug therapy for cleidocranial dysplasia.
