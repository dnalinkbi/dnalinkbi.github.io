# Information about gene MT-TF

## Genetic Position
MT-TF gene is located on the mitochondrial genome. It is located on the heavy strand of the mitochondrial genome at the position 5,630–5,759.

## Pathology
Mutations in MT-TF gene are known to be associated with mitochondrial diseases such as mitochondrial myopathy with lactic acidosis.

## Function for gene
MT-TF gene codes for mitochondrial-encoded mitochondrial RNA (MTRNR2) transfer RNA for phenylalanine (UUC) that translates the codon UUU.
