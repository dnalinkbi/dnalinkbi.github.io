# Information on Gene LIG3

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

* **Gene Name:** LIG3
* **Chromosome:** 17
* **Location:** 17q11.2
* **Pathology:** LIG3 mutations have been associated with developmental delays, growth retardation, facial abnormalities, and intellectual disability. 
* **Function:** The LIG3 gene encodes for DNA ligase III, an enzyme involved in the final step of DNA replication and DNA repair. It is primarily involved in Base Excision Repair and single-strand break repair, where it seals nicks in the DNA backbone. 

## Gene and Genomic Location Information

* **Gene ID:** 3980
* **Aliases:** DNLL, DNA ligase 3, LIG4, LIGIV, hLigIV, LigIIIalpha, LIG3A, LIG4, LIG4A, LIG4B, LIG4, LIG4P, LIG5, NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligase III alpha
* **External IDs:** 
    * HGNC: 6641
    * NCBI Entrez: 3980
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000108821
    * OMIM: 601839
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49916
