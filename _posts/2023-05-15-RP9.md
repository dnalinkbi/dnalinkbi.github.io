## Gene Name and Information

**Gene Name:** RP9

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 7q31.2

**Aliases:** RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 9 (RP9), RP7, GUCA1B, PRO1553

## Function for gene
The RP9 gene encodes a protein involved in the development and maintenance of the retina.

## External IDs and Sites

**HGNC ID:** HGNC:10464

**NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 6103

**Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000164891

**OMIM ID:** 607331

**UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9H2P6

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations associated with the RP9 gene that have been identified, most of them being missense mutations. Below are some examples:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| -----------| ------------ | ------------ |
| V156G | Missense | rs145365359 |
| Q236E | Missense | rs267606750 |
| R278H | Missense | rs145981501 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic mutations in the RP9 gene have been reported in cancers or other diseases.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the RP9 gene are associated with a form of retinitis pigmentosa known as RP9, which is a genetic disorder that affects the retina and can result in progressive vision loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for retinitis pigmentosa. Treatment options are aimed at slowing down the progression of the disease and managing symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is currently no known targeted drug therapy that is specifically for RP9-related retinitis pigmentosa.
