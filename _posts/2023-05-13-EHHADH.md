# Information about gene EHHADH

## Genetic Position
- EHHADH is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q25.1).
- The genomic coordinates for EHHADH are 149,300,000 to 149,361,931 base pairs (GRCh38).
- EHHADH spans approximately 61.9 kilobases.

## Pathology and Function
- EHHADH encodes for the Enzyme Enoyl-CoA Hydratase and 3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenase.
- The protein encoded by EHHADH plays a critical role in the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids.
- EHHADH is involved in the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids, which are essential components of cellular membranes.
- Mutations in EHHADH have been associated with various metabolic disorders, such as long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
