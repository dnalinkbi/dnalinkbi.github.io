## Gene: RMST

### Information about Gene:

- Function: RMST is a non-coding RNA gene and acts as regulator of neural differentiation. 

- External IDs: HGNC:31133, Entrez Gene:100379260, Ensembl:ENSG00000254221, OMIM:616958, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q6ZRY2

- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q13.1

- Aliases: RNA binding motif single-stranded interacting protein 3, LOC100379260

### Mutations:

- AA Mutation: No amino acid mutation data is available for gene RMST.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels: No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in gene RMST.

- dbSNP ID: There are no dbSNP IDs reported for gene RMST.

### Related Diseases:

As a non-coding RNA gene, RMST has not been directly linked to any disease. However, studies have shown that dysregulation of RMST expression may be linked to certain cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
