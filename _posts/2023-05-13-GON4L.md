## Information on Gene GON4L

### Genetic position
Gene GON4L is located on chromosome 1q21.1 and spans a length of approximately 269.12 kb.

### Pathology
The pathologies associated with GON4L mutations are yet to be fully elucidated. However, it has been found to be associated with susceptibility to developmental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. 

### Function
The protein encoded by GON4L plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and is a histone acetyltransferase.
