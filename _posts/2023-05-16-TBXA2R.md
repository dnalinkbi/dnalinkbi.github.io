# Information on Gene TBXA2R

## Gene Information
- Gene: TBXA2R (Thromboxane A2 receptor)
- Function: The protein encoded by this gene is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds thromboxane A2 and mediates platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.
- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 11814
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 6919
	- Ensembl: ENSG00000123191
    - OMIM: 188040
	- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P21731

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Start position: 6,076,964 bp
- End position: 6,102,501 bp
- Strand: Plus strand

## Variations
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
	- p.Arg60Cys (rs201184726)
	- p.Ile198Phe (rs3213708)
	- p.Ser324Gly (rs6511720)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
	- rs1057910
	- rs201184726
	- rs3213708
	- rs6511720

## Pathology and Diseases
- Related Disease: Cardiovascular disease, Asthma, Atherothrombosis, Coronary Artery Disease, Myocardial Infarction, Thrombosis
- Treatment and Prognosis: Treatment may include antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. Prognosis may vary depending on the disease and individual.

## Drug Response
- Drug response: Variations in this gene have been associated with altered drug response to antiplatelet agents, particularly aspirin.
