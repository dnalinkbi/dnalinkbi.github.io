## Gene Information

### Gene Symbol and Name 
- **Gene Symbol:** GP1BA
- **Gene Name:** Glycoprotein Ib Platelet Subunit Alpha

### Genomic Location
- **Chromosome:** 17
- **Genomic Position:** 48,174,466-48,177,321

### External IDs and Aliases
- **HGNC ID:** 4431
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 2811
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000108691
- **OMIM ID:** 606672
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P07359
- **Aliases:** CD42b, GP1B


## Function
The GP1BA gene encodes the alpha subunit of platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), which is a receptor for von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelet adhesion is initiated when GPIb interacts with vWF bound to an injured vessel wall, stimulating the platelet to change shape, bind to collagen, and activate integrin alpha-IIb/beta-3. 

## Variants/mutations and related disease
- **AA Mutation List:** 
   - p.Pro102Leu
   - p.Ala156Val
   - p.Asn13Met
- **Mutation type:** Missense Variants 
- **dbSNP ID:** rs3783007, rs140633729, rs61752731
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** None Identified
- **Related Disease:** Bernard-Soulier Syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of Bernard-Soulier Syndrome vary greatly depending on the severity of the symptoms. The aim of treatment is to prevent bleeding complications by raising the platelet count and replacing deficient clotting factors. Prognosis is generally good with careful management, but severe cases can lead to life-threatening bleeding.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to GP1BA mutations.
