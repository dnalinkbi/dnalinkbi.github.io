# **Information about Gene KCNQ3**

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function:

- **Gene Position:** KCNQ3 is located on chromosome 8 at position 24.3.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the KCNQ3 gene have been associated with benign familial neonatal seizures, a rare form of epilepsy that usually occurs within the first few days of life.

- **Function:** The KCNQ3 gene encodes a subunit of a voltage-gated potassium channel which plays a critical role in regulating the excitability of neurons and the generation of action potentials.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Sites:

- **External IDs:** The external ID for KCNQ3 gene is HGNC:6254, and the genomic location is 8q24.3. 

- **Aliases:** Some of the aliases for KCNQ3 gene are  Kv7.3, HNSPC, and MGC126612.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

- Some of the reported AA mutation types in KCNQ3 gene are:

    - p.Ala339Val
    - p.Thr312Ala
    - p.Arg230Cys
    - p.Ile284Thr

- Mutation type: Missense mutation

- dbSNP IDs: rs147864239, rs1219093574, rs369831971, rs761576827, rs1219093556.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

- There are no reports of somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for KCNQ3 gene.

## Related Disease:

- KCNQ3 gene mutations have been associated with Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures (BFNS), a rare form of epilepsy. 

## Treatment and Prognosis:

- The treatment of BFNS involves the use of antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and valproate. Most infants with BFNS have a good prognosis and seizures usually resolve within a few months.

## Drug Response:

- Studies have shown that KCNQ3 mutations can affect the drug response to antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin.
