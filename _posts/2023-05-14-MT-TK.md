## Gene: MT-TK

### Genetic Position 
MT-TK is a gene located on the mitochondrial DNA, specifically on the heavy strand. It is mapped to the NC_012920 reference sequence, with the coordinates from 12676 to 12812.

### Pathology
Mutations in MT-TK have been associated with various mitochondrial diseases, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). These mutations affect the function of the mitochondrial tRNA lysine, which is translated into the amino acid lysine. As a result, impaired protein synthesis and mitochondrial function can lead to the clinical manifestations observed in MELAS.

### Function
MT-TK gene encodes for the mitochondrial tRNA lysine, which is responsible for delivering lysine amino acid to the growing protein chain during mitochondrial translation.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs or InDels identified in the MT-TK gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the MT-TK gene have been associated with MELAS syndrome, with symptoms including stroke-like episodes, seizures, migraines, muscle weakness, and hearing loss.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MELAS syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and supporting the patient's overall health. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
There is limited data on drug response in patients with MELAS syndrome. However, some case reports have shown that treatment with coenzyme Q10 and L-arginine may improve symptoms.
