# Gene Information for ABCB6

## Gene Position
The ABCB6 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q35.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ABCB6 gene have been associated with a variety of diseases, including pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a rare disorder affecting the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system, and familial pseudohyperkalemia, a condition in which potassium levels in the blood appear to be elevated even though they are not.

## Function
The ABCB6 gene encodes a protein known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 6, which is involved in transporting heme from the mitochondria to the cytosol.
