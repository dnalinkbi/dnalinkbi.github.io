# Information about Gene MOGS

## Genetic Position
The MOGS gene is located on chromosome 2 at position 2p13.1.

## Pathology and Function
The MOGS gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of complex sugar molecules that are attached to proteins. Mutations in the MOGS gene can lead to a rare genetic disorder called congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIb (CDG-IIb), also known as MOGS-CDG. This condition can cause a variety of symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, liver problems, and eye abnormalities.

- V312G (rs104894140)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs or InDels associated with the MOGS gene.

## Related Disease
The MOGS gene is associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIb (CDG-IIb), also known as MOGS-CDG.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for MOGS-CDG, but treatment is focused on managing symptoms. This may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and medications to manage seizures or other conditions. The prognosis for individuals with MOGS-CDG varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response for MOGS-CDG.
