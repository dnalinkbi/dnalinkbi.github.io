## Gene: SEC63

### General Information
**Function**: The SEC63 gene encodes a protein named translocation protein SEC63 which is involved in the translocation and folding of secretory and membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

**Aliases**: HEDJ, HEL-S-70p, SEC63L1, BCS1, CRL3, FLJ53873, MGC138463

**Genomic Location (GRCh38)**: Chromosome 6 (NC_000006.12): 5252203-5300797 

### External IDs
- HGNC: 10633
- NCBI Entrez: 11268
- Ensembl: ENSG00000099902
- OMIM: 608648
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49936

### Mutations
**AA mutation list**: There are several mutations in SEC63 that have been reported in the literature. Some of them are:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R347C | Missense | rs104894183 |
| R415W | Missense | rs878853413 |
| R252* | Nonsense | rs79185115 |
| c.1568+1G>A | Splice site | rs1554532077 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels**: There is currently no data on somatic mutations in SEC63.

### Related Disease
SEC63 mutations have been linked to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG). 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for ADPKD and CDG. Treatment involves managing symptoms, improving quality of life, and slowing down the progression of the disease.

### Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs available that target SEC63 specifically. However, research on selective modulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway which includes SEC63 is ongoing.
