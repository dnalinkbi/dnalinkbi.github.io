# Gene HPSE2

## General Information
- **Function for Gene:** HPSE2 encodes heparanase 2, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are ubiquitous components of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes.
- **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 10855
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 10q24.1
    - Aliases: HPA2, HPR2, HP59, HsT447p17

## Mutations and Related Diseases
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - No AA mutations have been reported for HPSE2 gene in ClinVar
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for HPSE2 gene in dbSNP
- **Related Disease:** 
    - There is evidence suggesting that mutations in HPSE2 are associated with mucopolysaccharidosis-like syndrome (MPS-like syndrome), which is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities and developmental delay.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - Treatment mainly focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life
    - The long-term prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and age of onset.
- **Drug Response:**
    - Unknown
