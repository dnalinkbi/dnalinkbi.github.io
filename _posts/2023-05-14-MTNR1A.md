# Information about gene MTNR1A

## Genetic Position
MTNR1A gene is located on human chromosome 4q35.1 and spans about 19 kb.

## Pathology
MTNR1A gene is associated with various physiological and psychological processes including circadian rhythm, sleep, mood, and behavior. Dysfunctions in MTNR1A gene are related to several disorders including sleep-related disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, and more.

## Function
MTNR1A gene encodes the Melatonin receptor type 1A, a G protein-coupled receptor that binds melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms and sleep. The MTNR1A receptor is expressed in several tissues including the brain, retina, cardiovascular system, and immune cells. Activation of MTNR1A influences several biological processes including sleep, mood, and behavior.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Various compounds have been designed to target the MTNR1A receptor, and the use of melatonin itself has also been explored in treatment of different disorders. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and severity.

## Drug Response
Several drugs that target MTNR1A receptor have been developed and tested in clinical trials. Ramelteon, agomelatine, tasimelteon, and melatonin itself are some of the commonly used drugs.
