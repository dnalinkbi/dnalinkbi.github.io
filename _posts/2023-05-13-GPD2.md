# Gene: GPD2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): 2q24.2
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh37): 2q24.2

## Pathology
- GPD2 has been associated with several diseases including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function
- GPD2 encodes for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2, which is an enzyme involved in glycerol metabolism and energy production.
