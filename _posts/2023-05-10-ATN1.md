## Gene: ATN1

### Genetic position
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12p13.3


### Pathology
- Mutations in the ATN1 gene cause Huntington's disease-like type 1 (HDL1), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder.

### Function for gene
- The ATN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin-1, which is involved in the development and function of nerve cells in the brain.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic mutations with dbSNP ID have been reported for ATN1 gene.

### Related disease
- Huntington's disease-like type 1 (HDL1) - an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of progressive movement abnormalities and psychiatric disturbances.

### Treatment and prognosis
- There is currently no cure for HDL1. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic.

### Drug response
- There are currently no drugs specifically approved to treat HDL1.
