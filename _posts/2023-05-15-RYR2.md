## Gene: RYR2

### Genetic Position: 
RYR2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q43).

### Pathology:
Mutations in the RYR2 gene are associated with various cardiac disorders including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). CPVT is an inherited cardiac condition that increases the risk of sudden cardiac arrest in young people, especially during exercise or excitement. ARVD is a rare inherited heart disorder that affects the right ventricle of the heart, leading to arrhythmia and sudden death.

### Function:
RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) gene encodes a protein called cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) that is involved in the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of cardiac muscle cells. This calcium release triggers cardiac muscle contraction that generates the heartbeat.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic variants have been reported for RYR2 in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease:
- Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)
- Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment options for CPVT and ARVD include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and implantable cardiac defibrillators. Early diagnosis and regular monitoring can help improve the prognosis and prevent sudden cardiac arrest.

### Drug Response:
