# Gene: ASXL1

## Information
- **Function for gene:** The ASXL1 gene encodes for a protein involved in epigenetic regulation and transcriptional control. It interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and ubiquitin ligases to regulate gene expression and chromatin remodeling. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
  - Gene ID: 171023
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 20q11.21
  - Alias: BOPS, KIAA0978, MDS1, myelodysplasia syndrome 1 protein

  - c.1934_1935insT somatic mutation with dbSNP ID: rs761928957

## Related Disease
- The mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been linked to various hematological malignancies, including:
  - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  - Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
  - Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)
  
## Treatment and Prognosis
- The prognosis for patients with ASXL1 mutations in hematological malignancies is generally poor, with decreased overall survival and higher risk of relapse.
- There are currently no targeted therapies for ASXL1 mutations. Treatment may include chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, or supportive care.

## Drug Response
- The ASXL1 mutations have been associated with poor response to certain chemotherapy agents, such as azacitidine and decitabine.
