## Gene NEU2

### Genetic Position

The NEU2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p26.1). 

### Pathology

Mutations in the NEU2 gene have been associated with autoinflammation, joint contracture, and developmental delay syndrome (AIFJCDDS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by joint contractures, muscle weakness, and developmental delays. Additionally, aberrant expression of sialidases, including NEU2, has been implicated in the progression of various cancers.

### Function

The NEU2 gene encodes for the enzyme sialidase-2, also known as neuraminidase-2, which is responsible for the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from glycan chains. This process is involved in various cellular functions, including cell-cell interactions and signal transduction.

### AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID

No known disease-causing mutations have been reported in the NEU2 gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic variants have been reported in the NEU2 gene, including missense mutations, synonymous mutations, and frameshift mutations. A few examples of reported SNVs/InDels and their corresponding dbSNP IDs include:

- c.400C>T (p.Pro134Leu) rs75387698
- c.37+23T>C rs79990445
- c.99-121A>G rs587782758

### Related Disease

- Autoinflammation, Joint Contracture, and Developmental Delay Syndrome (AIFJCDDS)

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for AIFJCDDS, and treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of symptoms and complications.

### Drug Response

No known drug response has been reported for NEU2 gene mutations.
