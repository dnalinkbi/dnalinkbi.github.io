# Information about gene SLC6A1

## Genetic Position

The SLC6A1 gene is located on chromosome 3q25.2 and spans 77.58 kb.

## Pathology and Function

The SLC6A1 gene encodes a protein called the GABA transporter 1, which is responsible for the reuptake of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into neurons. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability. Mutations in the SLC6A1 gene have been associated with various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

## External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: 11006
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 6554
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000114737
- OMIM ID: 137165
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P30531
- Aliases: GAT1, GAT-1, SLC6A1, sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are various amino acid (AA) mutations associated with the SLC6A1 gene. Here are a few examples:

- p.R44Q (rs121907858)
- p.K270Q (rs121907860)
- p.R271C (rs121907861)
- p.R315W (rs121907856)
- p.P386A (rs121907854)

These mutations are mostly missense variants, meaning that they change a single amino acid in the protein sequence.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) associated with the SLC6A1 gene. Here are a few examples:

- rs151347616
- rs143224532
- rs757604355
- rs764281887

## Related Disease

Mutations in the SLC6A1 gene have been associated with various neurological disorders, including:

- Epilepsy: Mutations in SLC6A1 have been identified in patients with various forms of epilepsy, including myoclonic atonic epilepsy (MAE) and infantile spasms.
- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): Rare variants in SLC6A1 have been associated with ASD.
- Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Studies have suggested that genetic variants in SLC6A1 may contribute to the development of ADHD.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for epilepsy, ASD, or ADHD. Treatment options typically involve the use of medications to manage symptoms. Some medications, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, act on the GABAergic system and may be effective in treating epilepsy.

The prognosis for individuals with SLC6A1 mutations varies depending on the specific mutation and associated condition.

## Drug Response

Some studies have suggested that genetic variants in SLC6A1 may affect an individual's response to certain medications, such as benzodiazepines.
