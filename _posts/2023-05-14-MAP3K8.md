# Information about gene MAP3K8 

## Genetic Position
The MAP3K8 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 10q11.22.

## Pathology
Abnormalities in the MAP3K8 gene have been associated with several types of cancer, including breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of MAP3K8 has been observed in breast and colon cancer cells, which can lead to tumor growth and metastasis.

## Function
MAP3K8 encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8), also known as tumor progression locus 2 (TPL-2). This protein plays a key role in regulating cellular responses to stress and inflammation, and is involved in various signaling pathways that control cell growth, division, and survival.

Aliases for MAP3K8 gene include: COT, MEKK8, TPL2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Ser280Cys (rs35899656)
- Ala286Thr (rs3729691)
- Ala295Thr (rs3729690)
- Glu323Val (rs34166473)

All of the above mutations are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.1120G>A (rs76773854)
- c.626A>G (rs138252619)
- c.934C>T (rs146205614)

## Related Disease
Mutations in MAP3K8 have been associated with several types of cancer, including:
- Breast cancer
- Colon cancer
- Pancreatic cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Studies have suggested that targeting MAP3K8 may be a therapeutic strategy for certain types of cancer. Inhibition of MAP3K8 has been shown to suppress tumor growth and prevent metastasis in preclinical models of breast and colon cancer. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of MAP3K8 inhibitors in human cancer.

## Drug Response
Several MAP3K8 inhibitors have been developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for their potential to treat cancer.
