## Gene FBXO11

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2:215,485,357-215,568,826

**Pathology:** FBXO11 is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.

**Function:** FBXO11 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, and signal transduction.
