## Gene information for SHANK2

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 11q13.2 

**Function for gene:** The SHANK2 gene encodes for a protein known as SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domain protein 2 (SHANK2), which is found in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses and plays a role in the stabilization and organization of the synaptic complex.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the SHANK2 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and schizophrenia.

**Aliases:** ProSAP1, Shank2b, Shank2c, Shank2a

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 17046
- NCBI Entrez: 22941
- Ensembl: ENSG00000149541
- OMIM: 603290
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BYB0

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg558His (rs387906702)
- p.Glu1318Lys (rs376331705)
- p.Pro1721Leu (rs773164501)
- Missense mutations

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Related diseases:** 
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Intellectual disability
- Schizophrenia

**Treatment and prognosis:** Currently there is no cure for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with SHANK2 mutations. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms associated with the condition. Prognosis varies and depends on the specific condition and severity of symptoms.

**Drug response:** There is no specific drug approved for the treatment of SHANK2-associated conditions.
