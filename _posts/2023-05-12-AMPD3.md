## Gene: AMPD3
### Genomic Position
The AMPD3 gene is located on chromosome 11q13.1 and spans around 42.6 kb.

### Pathology
Mutations in the AMPD3 gene have been linked to multiple disorders, including exercise-induced muscle pain, myopathy, and muscle damage.

### Gene Function
The AMPD3 gene encodes for adenosine monophosphate deaminase-3 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism in skeletal muscle tissue.
