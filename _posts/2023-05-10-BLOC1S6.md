## Information about gene BLOC1S6

### Genetic position
BLOC1S6 is located on chromosome 15q21.3 and spans a region from 52,758,598 to 52,769,843 bp.

### Function
BLOC1S6 encodes a protein known as biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 subunit 6 (BLOC1S6). This protein is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. It is also involved in the regulation of cargo trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
No AA mutations are available for gene BLOC1S6.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for gene BLOC1S6 in dbSNP.

### Related disease
Mutations in BLOC1S6 have been associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a rare disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and pulmonary fibrosis.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Treatment is usually supportive and symptomatic. Patients with bleeding diathesis may need blood transfusions or desmopressin to stimulate the release of von Willebrand factor. Lung transplantation may be an option for patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis.

### Drug response
There is no specific drug for the treatment of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Treatment is usually supportive and symptomatic.
