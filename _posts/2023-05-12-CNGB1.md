## Gene CNGB1

### Genetic Position
CNGB1 gene is located on chromosome 16 at the position 13.1.

### Pathology and Function
CNGB1 gene encodes for the beta subunit of rod cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which is specifically expressed in rod photoreceptors of the retina. It plays a significant role in vision by mediating the influx of calcium ions in the rod cells and initiating the phototransduction cascade.

Mutations in CNGB1 gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease of the retina that causes progressive vision loss.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels are reported for CNGB1 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in CNGB1 gene are associated with the following disease:
- Retinitis pigmentosa

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for retinitis pigmentosa is limited and mostly symptomatic. In some cases, supplements like vitamin A or omega-3 fatty acids may be used to slow the progression of the disease. In severe cases, visual aids like glasses, magnifiers, or even Braille may be required. Prognosis for retinitis pigmentosa varies with the severity of the disease and the age of onset. In some cases, vision loss can be significant, while in others, it may only affect night vision.

### Drug Response
There is no standardized drug therapy available for retinitis pigmentosa, but several clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene therapies, stem cell therapies, and other novel treatments for this disease.
