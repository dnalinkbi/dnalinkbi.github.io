### Gene: CSF2RA

- Function: The CSF2RA gene provides instructions for making a protein called colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (CSF2RA). This protein is a member of the cytokine receptor family, which plays a crucial role in immune system function. The CSF2RA protein is primarily involved in the regulation of white blood cells, including the production and activation of immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels:

    No somatic mutations have been reported for the CSF2RA gene in COSMIC database as of 10th Nov 2021.

- Related Disease: Mutations in the CSF2RA gene are associated with a rare genetic disorder called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). This condition is characterized by the accumulation of a protein called surfactant in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress. PAP can be caused by mutations in several genes, including CSF2RA, but most cases are thought to be sporadic.

- Treatment and Prognosis: The treatment of PAP can involve whole lung lavage, which involves lavaging the affected lungs with an isotonic solution to remove the surfactant material. Other treatments include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhalation therapy, which has been shown to improve symptoms in some patients. However, the prognosis for PAP varies, and some patients may require lung transplantation.

- Drug Response: Patients with PAP caused by mutations in the CSF2RA gene may benefit from treatment with recombinant human GM-CSF, which can normalize alveolar macrophage function and reduce the accumulation of surfactant in the lungs.
