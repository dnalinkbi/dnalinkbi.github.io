# Information about Gene LYL1

## Genetic Position
Gene LYL1 is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

## Pathology
Aberrations in the LYL1 gene have been associated with the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Translocations involving the LYL1 gene have been found in patients with T-ALL.

## Function
The LYL1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. It plays a crucial role in the development of the hematopoietic system, specifically the T-cell lineage.

## External IDs and Genomic location
- HGNC ID: 6762
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 4066
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000105249
- OMIM ID: 151440
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P12980
- Genomic Location: 19q13.2
- Aliases: bHLHa23, TAL-1 complex protein LYL1 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are various amino acid mutations that have been reported in the LYL1 gene. Some of these include:
- rs180029315 (p.Ala206_Asn207delinsAsp)
- rs3730185 (p.Asn207Lys)
- rs180029328 (p.Glu251Lys)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels that have been reported in the LYL1 gene. Some of these include:
- rs797044171 (p.Leu32Pro)
- rs79335140 (p.Arg42Cys)
- rs759862997 (p.Asn53Ile)

## Related diseases
The LYL1 gene is associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for T-ALL involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies, and stem cell transplantation. Prognosis varies depending on the age of the patient, subtype of T-ALL, and other factors.

## Drug response
There are various drugs that have been used to treat T-ALL, including corticosteroids, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase. Response to these drugs can vary depending on the patient.
