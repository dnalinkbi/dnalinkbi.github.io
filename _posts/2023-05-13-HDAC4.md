## Gene information

**Gene name:** Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)

**Function:** HDAC4 encodes a class II histone deacetylase, which regulates gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histone lysine residues. It is involved in various biological processes, such as muscle development, neurogenesis, and cell differentiation. HDAC4 also plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders.

**Aliases:** HD4, AHO3, BDMR, HA6116, HDACA, KIAA0744

**Genomic location:** Chromosome 2q37.3

## Related diseases

- Cardiovascular diseases: HDAC4 is associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. It regulates the expression of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.
- Cancer: HDAC4 is overexpressed in various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer, and glioblastoma. It promotes tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by regulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
- Neurological disorders: HDAC4 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. It affects the synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and protein aggregation in the brain.

## Treatment and prognosis

- HDAC inhibitors: HDAC inhibitors, such as vorinostat and romidepsin, are used to treat cancer and other diseases by inhibiting HDAC activity. They induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in tumor cells and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
- Gene therapy: HDAC4 gene therapy has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy, muscular dystrophy, and neurodegenerative diseases. It aims to restore the normal expression of HDAC4 and its downstream target genes.
- Prognosis: The expression level of HDAC4 has been shown to be a prognostic factor in various cancers, such as colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. High expression of HDAC4 is associated with poor survival and disease recurrence.

## Drug response

- HDAC inhibitors: The response to HDAC inhibitors varies among individuals and cancer types. Some tumors are more sensitive to HDAC inhibitors than others due to their different genetic backgrounds and epigenetic profiles. The toxicity and side effects of HDAC inhibitors may limit their clinical use.
