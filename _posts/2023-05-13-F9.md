# Information about Gene F9

### Genetic Position
The F9 gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome at position Xq27.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in F9 can lead to the development of factor IX deficiency, also known as Hemophilia B. This is a bleeding disorder that can be inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.

### Function
The F9 gene encodes for the protein coagulation factor IX, which plays a key role in the blood clotting pathway.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 3532
- NCBI Entrez: 2158
- Ensembl: ENSG00000101981
- OMIM: 300746
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P00740 

Aliases for F9 include Christmas factor, plasma thromboplastin component, and PTC.

### Related Disease
Mutations in F9 can lead to Hemophilia B, also known as factor IX deficiency.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for Hemophilia B includes replacement therapy with infused factor IX products. The prognosis for individuals with Hemophilia B can vary depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
There are several drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of Hemophilia B, including BeneFIX and Alprolix.
