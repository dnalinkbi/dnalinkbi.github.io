# Information about gene CEP63
## Genetic Position
Gene CEP63 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q22.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in CEP63 are associated with Seckel Syndrome 5, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, small head size, and intellectual disability.

## Function
The CEP63 protein is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication and plays a critical role in the maintenance of genome stability.
