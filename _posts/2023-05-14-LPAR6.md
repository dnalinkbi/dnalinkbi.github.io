# Gene Information

## Gene Name: LPAR6 
Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 6

## Function
The LPAR6 gene encodes a subunit of a G protein-coupled receptor that binds the lipid signaling molecule lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which is involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival.
