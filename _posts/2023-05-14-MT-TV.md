# Gene MT-TV

**Genetic position:** MT-TV gene is located on the mitochondrial DNA at position 14,977.

**Pathology:** Mutations in MT-TV gene have been associated with a wide range of diseases, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), Leigh syndrome, and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers.

**Function:** MT-TV encodes for a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule which is responsible for bringing the amino acid tyrosine to the ribosome during protein synthesis.

**External IDs:**
- Gene ID: 4572
- Genomic location: NC_012920.1 (mitochondrial DNA)
- Alias: TRYT1

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- m.15257G>A - rs199476128

**Related disease:** Mutations in MT-TV gene have been associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic disease affecting the eyes.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for LHON, but there are some treatment options available. The use of idebenone has been shown to improve visual acuity in some cases.

**Drug response:** Idebenone has been shown to improve visual acuity in some cases of LHON.
