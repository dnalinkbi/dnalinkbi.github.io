## Information about gene TULP1

**Genetic Position:** TULP1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 at position 14.1 (6q14.1).

**Pathology:** Mutations in TULP1 are associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder that affects the retina and can cause vision loss.

**Function for gene:** TULP1 encodes a protein that is involved in the visual cycle and the development and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina.

**Aliases:** PT1, RP14

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 12598
- NCBI Entrez: 7287
- Ensembl: ENSG00000124762
- OMIM: 602280
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q62398

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg184Trp - Missense variant - rs104894003
- p.Arg759Ter - Nonsense variant - rs397515357
- p.Arg782Trp - Missense variant - rs121908636

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
No known somatic mutations in TULP1.

**Related Disease:** Retinitis Pigmentosa.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for Retinitis Pigmentosa, but there are treatments available to slow down the progression of vision loss. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the individual case.

**Drug response:** Some treatments for Retinitis Pigmentosa include vitamin A supplementation, which has been shown to slow down the disease progression in some patients.
