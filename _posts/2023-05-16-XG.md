# Gene XG

## Overview
Gene XG is located on the X chromosome and encodes a protein that functions as a member of the protease inhibitor family. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. 

## Function
The XG protein is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including blood coagulation and immune response.
