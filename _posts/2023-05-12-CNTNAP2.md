## Gene Information

### Gene Name and ID
The gene of interest is CNTNAP2, also known as Contactin-Associated Protein-Like 2.

Gene ID: 26047

### Genomic Location
The genomic location of CNTNAP2 is on chromosome 7q35.

### Aliases
The gene CNTNAP2 also goes by the following aliases:
- CASPR2
- KIAA0813

## Gene Function
The CNTNAP2 gene encodes a protein called contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), which is primarily found in the brain. CASPR2 is involved in the development and maintenance of neural circuits. It is thought to play a role in neural cell adhesion, axon guidance, and synapse formation.
