## **Information about Gene TRPV3**
### **Genetic Position**
The TRPV3 gene is located on chromosome 17q25.3.


### **Pathology**
Mutations in the TRPV3 gene have been linked to several skin disorders, including Olmsted syndrome, erythromelalgia, and atopic dermatitis. 

### **Function**
The TRPV3 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, and is involved in the regulation of calcium and sodium ions in cells. It is primarily expressed in skin keratinocytes and has been implicated in the regulation of skin temperature, pain sensation, and itch.

- c.2542C>G (rs767296001)
- c.2551T>C (rs36014366)

### **Related Disease**
- Olmsted syndrome
