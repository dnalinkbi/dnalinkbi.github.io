# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene RPS7 

## Gene Information

- **Function:** The RPS7 gene encodes for a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome. It is important for the translation of mRNA into proteins. 

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: 10407
    - Entrez ID: 6209
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000176165
    - OMIM ID: 180474
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P62081
    - Aliases: S7, RP5, RS7

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2: 210,340,465 - 210,353,987

## Mutations and Variations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.S11L - Missense - rs139643946
    - p.A19T - Missense - rs2276692
    - p.R36H - Missense - rs76816894
    - And more

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are many somatic SNVs/InDels found in RPS7 gene, for example: 
    - c.671A>G - rs138549633
    - c.263G>A - rs146402785
    - c.204_205delAG - rs767968009

## Related Diseases

Mutations in RPS7 gene have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare inherited blood disorder that results in anemia and physical abnormalities. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for DBA include blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for individuals with DBA varies based on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response

Studies suggest that RPS7 mutations may predict sensitivity to certain drugs such as erythromycin.
