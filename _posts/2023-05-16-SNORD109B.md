## Information about gene SNORD109B

**Genetic position**: SNORD109B is a small nucleolar RNA gene that is located within the intron of the WD repeat domain 3 (WDR3) gene on chromosome 7q11.23.

**Function**: SNORD109B is classified as a non-coding RNA gene, which means that it does not provide instructions for making a protein. Instead, it produces a small RNA molecule that plays an important role in the processing and modification of other RNAs.

**External IDs**: SNORD109B is also known by other names such as H/ACA box small nucleolar RNA 29B (SNORA29B) and U87 small nucleolar RNA (U87 snoRNA). Its genomic location is at chr7:7284911-7284979.
