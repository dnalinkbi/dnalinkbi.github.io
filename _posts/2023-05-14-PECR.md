# Gene: PECR

## Information
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 2q31.1
- **Function**: The PECR (peroxisomal trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase) gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. It catalyzes the reduction of trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA.
- **Aliases**: NR1H4, PAR1
