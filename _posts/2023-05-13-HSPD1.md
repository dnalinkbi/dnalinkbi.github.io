# Gene: HSPD1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2q33.1
- Start: 205,361,659 bp
- End: 205,391,550 bp

## Function
- HSPD1 gene encodes a heat shock protein that belongs to the chaperonin family. This protein is involved in the folding and assembly of proteins in the mitochondria. It also plays a role in the prevention of aggregation and the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease
- Spastic paraplegia, 13, autosomal dominant (SPG13)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure for SPG13. Treatment is limited to managing the symptoms.
- Studies have shown that mitochondrial chaperonins like HSPD1 may be a target for the development of drugs that could help to prevent neurodegeneration.

## Drug response
- There is no known drug response information available for HSPD1.
