# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene DDX5

## Gene Information
- Gene symbol: DDX5
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17 (17q21.33)
- External IDs: HGNC: 2737, NCBI Entrez: 1654, Ensembl: ENSG00000108702, OMIM: 602149, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P17844
- Aliases: G17P1, DBP2, DDX15, HELIC2, HLR1, p68

## Function
DDX5 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and is involved in RNA splicing, export, and translation regulation. It functions as a crucial component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and plays a role in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known specific treatment for DDX5-related diseases. Emerging therapies targeting RNA helicases may have potential in the future, especially for cancer types with high DDX5 expression levels. Prognosis varies depending on the associated disease, with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment being crucial factors.

## Drug Response
No drug response information specific to DDX5 is available.
