## Gene Information: GALK1

### Genetic Position 
The gene GALK1 is located on chromosome 17q24.2.

### Pathology
GALK1 gene mutations are responsible for galactokinase deficiency, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that affects galactose metabolism.

### Function 
The GALK1 gene encodes an enzyme called galactokinase, which is responsible for converting galactose to galactose-1-phosphate during the breakdown of lactose and other galactose-containing molecules.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:4167

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000108515
- OMIM ID: 604313
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P51570
- Aliases: GALK, GKD

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some common mutations in the GALK1 gene include:
- c.536A>G (p.Asp179Gly) with dbSNP ID: rs28936691
- c.556G>A (p.Arg186His) with dbSNP ID: rs28936415
- c.508C>T (p.Arg170Cys) with dbSNP ID: rs28936694

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the GALK1 gene.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in the GALK1 gene are associated with galactokinase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that affects galactose metabolism.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Galactokinase deficiency can be treated through a galactose-restricted diet. Early detection and treatment can prevent long-term complications such as cataracts and intellectual disability.

### Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically approved for the treatment of galactokinase deficiency.
