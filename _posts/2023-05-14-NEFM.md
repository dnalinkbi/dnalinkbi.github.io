## NEFM gene information

### Gene position
The NEFM gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8, specifically at the position 8p21.2.

### Gene function
NEFM encodes a protein called neurofilament medium polypeptide, which forms part of the neuronal cytoskeleton. This protein, together with other neurofilament subunits, provides structural support and helps maintain the axonal diameter.

### Related disease
Mutations in NEFM have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, but treatment can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Options may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces or other supportive devices, and medications to manage pain.

### Drug response
There is no specific drug that targets mutations in NEFM, but some medications may be helpful in managing the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, including pain medications and drugs that treat muscle stiffness or spasms.
