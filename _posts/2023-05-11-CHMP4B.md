# Information about Gene CHMP4B

## Genetic Position
The gene CHMP4B (Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 4B) is located on chromosome 20 at position 20q11.23.

## Pathology and Function 
CHMP4B encodes a protein that belongs to the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) III complex. This protein is involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and in the degradation of specific proteins in lysosomes. It is also involved in cytokinesis, HIV budding, and autophagy.

## External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs for the gene are as follows:
  - HGNC: 20054
  - NCBI Entrez: 128866
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000125772
  - OMIM: 612995
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H444

- Aliases for the gene are as follows:
  - CHMP4
  - C20orf188
  - SNF7L2

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are several AA mutations associated with CHMP4B, listed below with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs:
  - T290M (Missense mutation, rs587776940)
  - A296T (Missense mutation, rs587776942)
  - T37M (Missense mutation, rs587776935)
  - S20L (Missense mutation, rs587776934)
  - R233Q (Missense mutation, rs587776937)
  - L251F (Missense mutation, rs1554295417)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels that have been reported in CHMP4B with their dbSNP IDs are:
  - rs77776433
  - rs10845446
  - rs201786055
  - rs140046398

## Related Disease
- There is evidence to suggest that mutations or alterations in the CHMP4B gene play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment available for CHMP4B mutations. However, depending on the specific disease associated with the mutation, treatment options may be available to manage symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no information available on drug response specifically related to CHMP4B mutations.
