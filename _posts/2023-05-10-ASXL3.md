# Gene: ASXL3

### Information
The ASXL3 gene is located on chromosome 18q12.1. Its encoded protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Mutations in ASXL3 have been associated with developmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures.

### Function
The ASXL3 protein is involved in chromatin modification and regulation of gene expression.

### Related Disease
Mutations in ASXL3 have been associated with Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome (BRS), a disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for BRS. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms, such as medication for seizures and behavioral therapy for intellectual disability.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug specifically targeting ASXL3 mutations. Treatment is focused on management of symptoms.
