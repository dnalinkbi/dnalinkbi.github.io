# Analysis of Gene GNAS

## Gene Information

- **Function:** The GNAS gene encodes a G protein alpha subunit which is involved in signal transduction through a variety of pathways.
- **External IDs:**	
   - Entrez ID: 2778 
   - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000173541 
   - HGNC ID: 4410 
   - OMIM ID: 139320 
   - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q5TBB1
- **Aliases:** GNAS1, GNASxl, GNAS2, AHO, GSP, PHP1A, POH, PHP1B, GNAS-AS1, NESP, NESP55, XLas, AHO1, C20orf45, GNAS complex locus

## Genetic Position

- **Chromosome:** 20 
- **Genomic Position:** 57,817,318 - 57,958,971 bp (GRCh38) 

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List:** 
   - p.Arg201Cys (R201C)
   - p.Arg201His (R201H)
   - p.Arg201Ser (R201S)
   - p.Arg201Leu (R201L)
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs121913270, rs121913269, rs121913268, rs28931614

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the GNAS gene with varying frequencies across different cancers.
- **dbSNP ID:** rs113540185, rs119234984, rs121434618, rs28934574, rs28933385, rs41276752

## Pathology and Related Disease

- GNAS mutations are associated with multiple human diseases including:
   - Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO)
   - Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP1A)
   - Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP1B)
   - McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS)
- Somatic mutations in GNAS have been found in several types of cancers including:
   - Ovarian cancer
   - Colorectal cancer
   - Pancreatic cancer
   - Thyroid cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation.
- Individuals with AHO, PHP1A, and PHP1B may require hormone replacement therapy and/or other supportive treatments.
- Prognosis for cancers with GNAS mutations is generally poor, and treatment options are limited.

## Drug Response

- There is limited information available on drug response in individuals with GNAS mutations.
- Some studies suggest that GNAS mutations may be associated with resistance to certain targeted therapies.
