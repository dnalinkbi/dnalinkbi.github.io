# Gene EMX2

## Basic Information
- EMX2 (empty spiracles homeobox 2) is a gene that encodes a homeobox domain-containing transcription factor.
- It is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q26.3).
- Its aliases are Empty Spiracles Homolog 2 (Drosophila) and OTX3.

## Function
- EMX2 plays a crucial role in normal prenatal development and pattern formation of the brain and urogenital tract.
- It regulates the differentiation and proliferation of neural progenitors and plays a key role in the development of the anterior part of the brain, also known as the forebrain.
- EMX2 is also involved in the development of the male genitals.
