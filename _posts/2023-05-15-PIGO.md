# Gene: PIGO

## Genetic Position
The PIGO gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 at position 13.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PIGO gene can cause a rare genetic disorder known as hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome 4 (HPMRS4). This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia, and increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase.

## Function
The PIGO gene encodes a protein that is involved in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors attach proteins to the cell membrane and are important for many cellular processes.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the PIGO gene.

## Related Disease
- Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome 4 (HPMRS4)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for HPMRS4, and treatment is generally supportive and symptomatic. The prognosis for individuals with HPMRS4 is variable and depends on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specific to mutations in the PIGO gene.
