# Information about Gene SERPINI1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** SERPINI1 gene is located on chromosome 3 (3q26.1). 
- **Pathology:** Mutations in SERPINI1 have been associated with various forms of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.
- **Function:** SERPINI1 encodes for a protein called neuroserpin, which is mainly found in the brain and acts as a serine protease inhibitor. Neuroserpin has been shown to play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and inflammation.
