# Gene LMNB1

LMNB1 is a gene that encodes for Lamin B1, a protein that belongs to the lamin family of intermediate filament proteins. Lamin B1 plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleus and in regulating gene expression by interacting with chromatin.

## Function

Lamin B1 is an essential component of the nuclear lamina, a mesh-like network of intermediate filaments that underlies the inner nuclear membrane. It provides mechanical support to the nucleus and regulates its shape and size. In addition, it interacts with chromatin and participates in the regulation of gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair processes.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA mutations reported in the LMNB1 gene. Some of the common ones are:

- c.1010C>T (p.Arg337Cys) - rs121908619
- c.1559G>A (p.Gly520Ser) - rs121908620
- c.741G>A (p.Gly247Asp) - rs61741786
- c.1315C>T (p.Arg439Cys) - rs121908618

These are missense mutations, which change a single amino acid in the Lamin B1 protein, and are associated with a variety of diseases.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported in the LMNB1 gene, which are associated with various types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Some of the common ones are:

- c.1148C>T (p.Pro383Leu) - rs267607043
- c.1558C>T (p.Thr520Met) - rs114269614
- c.1484G>T (p.Asp495Tyr) - rs12716792
- c.1163A>G (p.Tyr388Cys) - rs267607044

## Related disease

Mutations in the LMNB1 gene are associated with several diseases, including:

- Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD): a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the white matter of the brain.
- Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS): a rare genetic disorder that causes premature aging.
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 2B1 (CMT2B1): a neuropathy that affects the peripheral nerves.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for ADLD, HGPS, or CMT2B1, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life of affected individuals.

## Drug response

There is no information available on drug response specifically related to mutations in the LMNB1 gene.
