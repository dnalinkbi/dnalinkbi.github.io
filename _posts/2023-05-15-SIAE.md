## Gene Information

**Gene:** SIAE

**Function:** SIAE (Sialic acid acetylesterase) is involved in the regulation of B-cell activation. It can remove acetyl groups from sialic acid residues on the surface of cells and molecules, affecting their recognition by the immune system. SIAE is specifically expressed in B cells and has been shown to affect the autoantibody response in some autoimmune diseases.

**Aliases:**
- MGC138852
- C20orf156
- EC 3.1.1.53
- UNQ3054/PRO9847

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 20: 40,201,481-40,240,497

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 29072
- NCBI Entrez: 643607
- Ensembl: ENSG00000284632
- OMIM: 615261
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6PL18

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
There are several missense mutations identified for SIAE, including:
- R3W (rs137852658)
- R129W (rs370775277)
- L38P (rs150918202)
- G170E (rs780325715)

These mutations are all associated with decreased or abolished SIAE enzyme activity.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID reported for SIAE.

**Related Disease:**
- Autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sjogren's syndrome.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
There are currently no specific treatments for SIAE mutations. Treatment for autoimmune diseases associated with SIAE mutations generally consists of immunosuppressive therapies. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the autoimmune disease.

**Drug Response:**
There is no known drug response associated with SIAE mutations.
