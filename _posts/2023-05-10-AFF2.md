# Information about gene AFF2

## Genetic Position
The AFF2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome at position 11.21.

## Pathology

Mutations in the AFF2 gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, including Fragile X syndrome, X-linked intellectual disability, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

## Function for gene

The AFF2 gene encodes a protein known as AF4/FMR2 family member 2, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling.
