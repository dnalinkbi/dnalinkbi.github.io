# Information about gene VNN1

## Genetic Position
- Gene: VNN1 (vanin 1)
- Chromosome: 6
- Start position: 31,499,680 bp
- End position: 31,523,759 bp

## Pathology and Function for gene
- VNN1 is a member of the vanin family of proteins and is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney.
- The protein encoded by VNN1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked surface membrane protein that exhibits both pantetheinase and thioesterase activities.
- Pantetheinase converts pantetheine to pantothenate (vitamin B5), a precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for the synthesis and metabolism of fatty acids and other compounds.
- Thioesterase cleaves various thioester substrates, such as acyl-CoA and reduced glutathione S-acyl esters, which are involved in lipid metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics, respectively.
