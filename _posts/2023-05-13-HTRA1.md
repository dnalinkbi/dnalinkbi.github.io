# Information about gene HTRA1

## Genetic Position
The HTRA1 (High-temperature requirement protein A1) gene is located on the human chromosome 10 (10q26.3).

## Pathology
Variations in the HTRA1 gene have been linked to various age-related degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and osteoarthritis.

## Function
The HTRA1 gene encodes a serine protease that is involved in the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins. It is also involved in the regulation of various cellular processes such as apoptosis, differentiation, and immune response.
