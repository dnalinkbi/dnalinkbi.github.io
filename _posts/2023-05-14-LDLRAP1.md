## Gene: LDLRAP1

* Function: The LDLRAP1 gene encodes a protein called Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adapter Protein 1. This protein is involved in the endocytosis of LDL-cholesterol, which is a type of cholesterol that can potentially contribute to cardiovascular disease.

  * c.1219-54C>G - rs150596671

* Related disease: Mutations in LDLRAP1 have been associated with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia and familial hypercholesterolemia.

* Treatment and prognosis: Management of hypercholesterolemia associated with LDLRAP1 mutations typically involves lifestyle changes and pharmacological intervention with statins or other cholesterol-lowering medications. Long-term prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disease and effectiveness of treatment.

* Drug response: Some LDLRAP1 mutations may influence patient response to statin therapy, though more research is needed to fully understand this relationship.
