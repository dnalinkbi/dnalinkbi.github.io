## Gene: CDKN2C

### Genetic Position:
Chromosome: 1

Start :  159,862,785 bp

End : 160,167,826 bp

### Pathology:
Mutations in CDKN2C gene have been linked to several types of cancer, including B-cell lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors such as lung and breast cancers.

### Function:
CDKN2C gene encodes a protein called Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor C (p18INK4C), which is a tumor suppressor. It inhibits the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), a protein involved in cell division, thus preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and promoting cell cycle arrest.

### Related Disease:
- Lung cancer
- Breast cancer
- B-cell lymphomas
- Multiple myeloma

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Since CDKN2C gene is involved in cell cycle regulation, its mutations have been considered as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. However, more research is needed to develop effective drugs that target this gene. The prognosis of cancer patients with CDKN2C mutations may vary depending on the type and stage of cancer.

### Drug Response:
No drugs have been developed specifically targeting CDKN2C gene mutations yet. However, some drugs that target CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved for cancer treatment, which indirectly affect the activity of p18INK4C protein.
