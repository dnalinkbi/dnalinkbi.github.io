# Gene: HBB

## Genetic Position
The HBB gene is located on chromosome 11 (11p15.4).

## Pathology
The HBB gene encodes for the beta-globin protein, which is a component of hemoglobin. Mutations in this gene can cause hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.

## Function
The beta-globin protein is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. The HBB gene provides instructions for creating the beta-globin protein, which is an important component of the hemoglobin molecule.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the HBB gene with dbSNP IDs.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HBB gene can cause several hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia vary based on disease severity and may include blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, and medication. Prognosis also varies based on disease severity, but early diagnosis and proper management can improve health outcomes for individuals with these conditions.

## Drug Response
Individuals with sickle cell disease may respond to hydroxyurea, a medication that can increase fetal hemoglobin production, which can help improve symptoms.
