# Gene SMPD1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

The SMPD1 gene is located on chromosome 11p15.4 and encodes for the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. This enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphate. 

Mutations in SMPD1 can lead to the development of Niemann-Pick disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin. 

## Function

The acid sphingomyelinase encoded by SMPD1 is essential in lipid metabolism and homeostasis. Without it, sphingomyelin cannot be broken down, leading to its accumulation and pathological consequences.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID

- p.Arg610Pro (rs121908001)
- p.Asp409Glu (rs80356733)
- p.Thr451Pro (rs141033743)
- p.Met364Val (rs137852696)
- p.Arg498Leu (rs28940873)
- p.Leu302Phe (rs121908003)

All of the above mutations are missense mutations, meaning that a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) recorded for SMPD1. However, they are not well-studied and do not have any associated dbSNP IDs.

## Related Disease

Niemann-Pick disease is the primary disease associated with mutations in SMPD1. It is a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder that can affect various systems in the body, including the liver, spleen, lungs, and brain.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for Niemann-Pick disease; treatment options are limited to symptom management. In severe cases, bone marrow transplantation and gene therapies are being developed as potential treatment options.

## Drug response

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase has shown some potential in preclinical studies for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease. However, it has not yet been approved for clinical use by regulatory agencies.
