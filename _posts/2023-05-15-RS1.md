## Gene RS1
- **Location**: Xp22.13
- **Aliases**: XLRS1, X-linked retinoschisis 1
- **Function**: This gene encodes for retinoschisin protein which is a cell adhesion protein present in retina cells. It helps to maintain the structural integrity of retina cells and also assists in cell signaling. Mutations in this gene can lead to X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) that affects vision quality and can lead to blindness.

    - HGNC: 10410
    - NCBI Entrez: 6247
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000102054
    - OMIM: 312700
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55098
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
    - p.Arg102Trp (rs61751375)
    - p.Arg197Cys (rs61751374)
    - p.Tyr203Cys (rs121912711)
    - p.Tyr203His (rs121912696)
    - Missense, pathogenic
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
    - rs1555782471
    - rs553111814
- **Related Disease**: X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)
- **Treatment and prognosis**: Currently, there is no cure for XLRS. Treatment options are limited to supporting the vision by correcting refractive errors, managing complications such as retinal detachment, and low-vision rehabilitation.
- **Drug response**: Studies have shown that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) can help reduce the macular thickness and improve visual acuity specifically in patients with foveal cysts resulting from XLRS.
