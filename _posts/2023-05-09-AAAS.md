## Information about the AAAS gene

### Genetic position:

The AAAS gene is located on chromosome 12 at the position p13.31. It spans a genomic region of approximately 30 kilobases.

### Pathology:

Mutations in the AAAS gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Allgrove syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by the triad of achalasia, adrenal insufficiency, and alacrima. 

### Function:

The AAAS gene encodes a protein called alacrima, achalasia, and adrenal insufficiency syndrome protein (AAAS protein). The exact function of the AAAS protein is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular transport.

### External IDs and aliases:

- HGNC ID: 15
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 8086
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000139567
- OMIM ID: 231550
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NRG9

Aliases: ALADIN, ALDIN

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

There are several mutations reported in the AAAS gene associated with Allgrove syndrome:

- L95P (rs137853855)
- E374fs (rs113169174)
- G211D (rs137853853)
- G165fs (rs398123461)
- R79*
- E72K (rs137853856)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There is limited information regarding somatic SNVs/InDels in the AAAS gene.

### Related disease:

Allgrove syndrome (AAAS) 

### Treatment and prognosis:

There is currently no cure for Allgrove syndrome. Treatment is focused on alleviating the symptoms, such as hormone replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency and pneumatic dilation or surgery for achalasia. Early diagnosis and management can improve the patient's prognosis.

### Drug response:

There is limited information regarding drug response related to Allgrove syndrome.
