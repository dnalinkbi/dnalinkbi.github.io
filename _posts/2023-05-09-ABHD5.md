## Gene Information

**Gene:** ABHD5

**Pathology:** ABHD5 mutations are known to cause an autosomal recessive disorder called Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS). CDS is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets in various tissues, including the skin, liver, eyes, and muscles.

**Function:** The ABHD5 gene encodes a protein called abhydrolase domain-containing protein 5, which is involved in the breakdown of intracellular triglycerides. ABHD5 activates an enzyme called PNPLA2, which breaks down triglycerides into fatty acids that can be used for energy.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 1671
- NCBI Entrez: 10909
- Ensembl: ENSG00000213923
- OMIM: 604780
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8WTS1

**Aliases:** CGI-58, G0S2, ABHD5B, FLJ23868, Hel-25

**AA Mutation List:** 

Several mutations have been reported in the ABHD5 gene, predominantly in patients with Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. A few examples of missense mutations are:

1. p.Ala87Thr - rs137852044
2. p.Glu292Lys - rs121908294
3. p.Ile142Ser - rs137852045

**Mutation Type:** Missense Mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** 

There are known somatic SNVs/InDels in the ABHD5 gene identified in various cancers. A few examples are:

1. c.278A>T - rs1556138058
2. c.1257G>T - rs141758218

**Related Disease:** 

Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome, Neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis (NLSDI)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** 

There is no cure currently available for CDS. Treatment is symptomatic and may include dietary restriction of long-chain fatty acids and medium-chain triglycerides. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease, and it can range from normal lifespan to early demise. 

**Drug Response:** 

There is no specific drug available for the treatment of Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome. However, a recent study suggested the use of fibrates as a potential therapeutic option.
