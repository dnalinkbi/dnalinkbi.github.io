# Information about Gene HOXA11

## Genetic Position

The gene HOXA11 is located on chromosome 7p15.2. It spans 71.51 kbp and has 3 exons.

## Pathology and Function

The HOXA11 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development. It is involved in the formation of the limbs, urogenital tract, and the development of the uterus in females. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several reproductive disorders such as infertility, endometriosis, and uterine anomalies.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the HOXA11 gene have been associated with several reproductive disorders, including:

- Mullerian Aplasia and Hyperandrogenism: Mutations in the HOXA11 gene have been found in patients with Mullerian aplasia (absence of uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina) and hyperandrogenism (excessive male hormone production).
- Endometriosis: The HOXA11 gene has been implicated in the development of endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pain and infertility.
- Uterine Anomalies: Mutations in HOXA11 have been associated with uterine anomalies such as unicornuate uterus (a rare congenital abnormality where the uterus is shaped like a horseshoe), bicorunate uterus (where the uterus has two "horns"), and septate uterus (where the uterus is divided by a wall of tissue). 

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for genetic disorders caused by mutations in the HOXA11 gene. Treatment options depend on the specific disorder and may include hormonal therapy, surgery, or assisted reproduction techniques.

## Drug Response

The effect of drugs on individuals with mutations in the HOXA11 gene is yet to be studied.
