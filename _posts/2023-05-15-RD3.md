# Information about Gene RD3

## Genetic Position

Gene Name: RD3

Genomic Location: Chromosome 1: 134,480,285-134,490,219

## Pathology and Function

### Function

The RD3 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of photoreceptor cell function. It acts as a negative regulator of the visual signaling pathway, helping to maintain stable visual function.

### External IDs

External IDs for RD3 gene and genomic location, as well as aliases, include:

- HGNC: 9926
- NCBI Entrez: 284707
- Ensembl: ENSG00000187600
- OMIM: 180069
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96KN7

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA mutations associated with RD3 gene with dbSNP ID:

- p.Ala78Thr (dbSNP: rs61750839)
- p.Arg107Trp (dbSNP: rs369968543)
- p.His138Asp (dbSNP: rs149996250)
- p.Arg98Leu (dbSNP: rs786204795)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with RD3 gene.

### Related Disease

RD3 mutations are associated with a type of retinal degeneration called Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the retina, causing vision loss and blindness from birth or within the first few months of life.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for LCA caused by mutations in the RD3 gene. However, treatments such as gene therapy and retinal implants may provide some benefit to patients.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug response for mutations in the RD3 gene.
