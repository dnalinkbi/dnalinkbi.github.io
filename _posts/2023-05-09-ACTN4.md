## Information about Gene ACTN4

**Genetic Position:** The ACTN4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.2 (19q13.2).

**Pathology:** Mutations in the ACTN4 gene have been linked to various pathologies including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), an inherited kidney disease that affects the filtering units in the kidneys.

**Function:** The ACTN4 gene encodes the actinin-alpha 4 protein, which belongs to a family of actin-binding proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. The protein is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the kidney's filtration system.

**External IDs:** The ACTN4 gene is also known by other names including alpha-actinin-4 and FSGS1. Its external IDs include:
- HGNC: 169
- NCBI Entrez: 81
- Ensembl: ENSG00000105383
- OMIM: 604638
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P12814

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** 
- p.Arg312Cys: missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs61753371)
- p.Asp550Gly: missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs79704546)
- p.Arg405Ter: nonsense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs752334673)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** 
- c.998T>C: missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs767296479)
- c.363G>A: missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs587776836)

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the ACTN4 gene have been associated with FSGS, an inherited kidney disease that typically leads to renal failure.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options for FSGS depend on the severity of the disease. Mild cases may be treated with medication while more severe cases may require a kidney transplant. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age at which symptoms begin to appear. 

**Drug Response:** The use of steroids and immunosuppressants has been shown to improve proteinuria and slow the progression of FSGS.
