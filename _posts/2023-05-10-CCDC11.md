# Information about gene CCDC11

## Genetic position
The CCDC11 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 at position 18q21.1. 

## Pathology
Mutations in this gene have been associated with different pathologies including cancer and neurological disorders.

## Function
The CCDC11 gene encodes for the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 11, which has been identified as a component of the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex. This complex is involved in the innate immune response. CCDC11 also plays a role in the regulation of autophagy and the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis.

## Related diseases
CCDC11 mutations have been associated with different neurological disorders such as spastic paraplegia, hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and hereditary spastic ataxia.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for CCDC11-related disorders. Management of symptoms can be done through physical therapy and medications to control spasticity.

## Drug response
There is limited information regarding drug response in patients with CCDC11 mutations.
