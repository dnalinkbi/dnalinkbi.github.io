# Information about Gene CR2

## Genetic Position
* CR2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q32.2).

## Pathology and Function
* CR2 gene encodes a protein called Complement Receptor 2 (CR2), which plays an important role in the immune system by binding to complement fragments iC3b and C3d.
* It is involved in B cell activation and regulation, modulation of complement activation, and clearance of immune complexes.
* Mutations in the CR2 gene have been associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases including malaria, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
