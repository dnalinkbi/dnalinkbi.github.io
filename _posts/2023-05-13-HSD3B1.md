# Information about gene HSD3B1

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

**Genetic position:** HSD3B1 (hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1) is located on chromosome 1q23.3.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the HSD3B1 gene have been linked to susceptibility to prostate cancer, and specifically to castration-resistant prostate cancer.

**Function:** The HSD3B1 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of testosterone via the androgen biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is responsible for converting DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) to androstenedione, which is then converted to testosterone.

## Gene Information 

**External IDs:** HGNC: 5240; NCBI Entrez: 3283; Ensembl: ENSG00000120699; OMIM: 109715; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P14060

**Aliases:** 3BHS1; HSD3B; HSDB3; SDR11E1

## Genetic mutations

**AA Mutation List:** The most common mutation in HSD3B1 is a missense mutation that results in an amino acid substitution at position 124 (L124V). Other mutations have also been identified, including HSD3B1 p.Tyr54Cysfs*13, p.Lys36*, and p.Ile145Thr. 

**Mutation Type:** Missense mutation (L124V), frameshift mutation (p.Tyr54Cysfs*13, p.Lys36*), and missense mutation (p.Ile145Thr).

**dbSNP ID:** rs1047303 (L124V)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

**dbSNP ID:** Several somatic mutations have been identified in HSD3B1 in prostate cancer samples, including rs11552449, rs62644041, rs7210100, rs116786347, rs72565568, and rs62644031.

## Related diseases

Mutations in HSD3B1 have been linked to susceptibility to prostate cancer, and specifically to castration-resistant prostate cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for HSD3B1 mutations. The prognosis for individuals with prostate cancer and HSD3B1 mutations may depend on the specific mutation and other factors such as age and stage of cancer.

## Drug response

HSD3B1 mutations may have an impact on response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients. Specifically, the L124V mutation has been associated with a decreased response to ADT.
