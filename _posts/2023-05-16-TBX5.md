## Gene: TBX5

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position**: TBX5 is located on chromosome 12 (12q24.1).
- **Pathology**: Mutations in TBX5 have been associated with a variety of heart and limb malformations, including Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS).
- **Function**: TBX5 is a transcription factor which plays an essential role in the development of the heart and upper limbs during embryonic development.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels with dbSNP ID.
- **Related disease**: Holt-Oram Syndrome (HOS)
- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for HOS involves surgery for heart defects and therapies to address limb abnormalities. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the heart defects.
- **Drug response**: There is currently no specific drug treatment for TBX5 mutations. Treatment is focused on addressing the associated conditions and symptoms.
