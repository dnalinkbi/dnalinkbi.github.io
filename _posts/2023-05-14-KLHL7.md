## Gene: KLHL7

#### *Function for gene*
KLHL7 is a part of the Kelch-like protein family, which acts as a substrate adapter for the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in protein degradation and regulation of many biological processes, including cell cycle, differentiation, and migration.

- p.Leu105Ser (rs142280609)

#### *Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID*
There are no known somatic variants in the KLHL7 gene.

#### *Related disease*
Mutations in the KLHL7 gene have been associated with Autosomal Recessive Spastic Paraplegia Type 45 (SPG45), which is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by lower limb spasticity, weakness, and atrophy.

#### *Treatment and prognosis*
Currently, there is no specific treatment for SPG45. Treatment is symptomatic, and physical therapy and assistive devices may be necessary. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease, but many patients have a normal lifespan.

#### *Drug response*
There is no information available regarding drug responses related to KLHL7.
