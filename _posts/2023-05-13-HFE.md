## Gene HFE

- Function: The HFE gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the absorption of iron in the body. The protein interacts with another protein called transferrin receptor 1 to regulate the uptake of iron into cells.

- External IDs: HGNC: 4883, Ensembl: ENSG00000134002, NCBI Entrez: 3077, OMIM: 613609, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q30201

- Aliases: HFE1, HLA-H, Class I antigen-like locus

- AA mutation list: The most common mutation in the HFE gene is C282Y, which causes a change in the protein's amino acid sequence from cysteine to tyrosine. Another mutation, H63D, is less common and changes an amino acid from histidine to aspartic acid.

- Mutation type and dbSNP ID: C282Y is a missense mutation with dbSNP ID rs1800562, and H63D is a missense mutation with dbSNP ID rs1799945.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported.

- Related disease: Mutations in the HFE gene can cause hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder characterized by excessive absorption of dietary iron, leading to a buildup of iron in body tissues. This can damage organs and tissues and lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain, and liver disease.

- Treatment and prognosis: Hereditary hemochromatosis can be treated by regular blood removal, called phlebotomy, which reduces the amount of iron in the body. If diagnosed and treated early, the outlook for people with hemochromatosis is generally good.

- Drug response: People with hemochromatosis may need to avoid iron supplements and should be cautious when taking medications that contain iron, such as multivitamins. Certain medications can also affect iron levels in the body and should be used with caution.
