## Gene Information

### Gene Name:
The gene MRPL48, also known as Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L48, is a protein-coding gene.

### Function:
The MRPL48 gene encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome subunit. It helps in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins.

### Aliases:
Some common aliases for MRPL48 gene are: MRP-L48, 68kDa subunit, L48mt

### Genomic Location:
The MRPL48 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q21.1).

### External IDs:
Here are the external IDs for MRPL48 gene in different databases:
- HGNC: 15767
- NCBI Entrez: 57237
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100650
- OMIM: 610338
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9N0V2

### AA Mutation list and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
There are several AA mutations in MRPL48 gene listed in the dbSNP database. Here are few of them:
- L48P (rs756162441)
- N67S (rs187843686)
- D26N (rs140027526)
- G9A (rs786200050)

All of these mutations are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are few somatic SNVs/inDels found in the MRPL48 gene. Here are few of them:
- rs140146481
- rs139915060
- rs141726446

### Related Disease:
There is no specific disease linked to the MRPL48 gene, but mutations in this gene are associated with different types of mitochondrial diseases.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for MRPL48 gene-related mitochondrial diseases depend on the type and severity of the disease.

### Drug Response:
The drug response for MRPL48 gene-related mitochondrial diseases is still under investigation.
