## Information about gene FCGRT

### Genetic position
The FCGRT gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.32).

### Pathology
The FCGRT gene is associated with several diseases, including IgG deficiency, autoimmune diseases, and susceptibility to infections.

### Function
The FCGRT gene encodes the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is involved in regulating the half-life of IgG antibodies. FcRn binds to IgG antibodies in acidic conditions (i.e. in endosomes), preventing their degradation and enabling their transport across cell barriers. This process is critical for maintaining adequate levels of IgG antibodies in the circulatory system and protecting against infections.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for FCGRT in dbSNP.

### Related disease
Mutations in FCGRT have been associated with immunodeficiency 10 (IMD10) and susceptibility to infections, such as invasive pneumococcal disease and malaria.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no specific treatment for FCGRT-related diseases. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms and prevention of infections. The prognosis for patients with FCGRT-related diseases varies depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug response
There is limited information on drug response for FCGRT-related diseases. However, recent studies have shown that targeting FcRn with therapeutic antibodies can be effective for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
