# Gene: AMN

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 14
- Location: 14q32.13

## Pathology
Mutations in the AMN gene are associated with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, also known as selective cobalamin malabsorption type 1 (OMIM #261100). This condition is characterized by cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 and urinary excretion of transcobalamin 2 (TCN2)-bound cobalamin. 

## Function
The AMN gene encodes the membrane-associated protein AMN, which forms a complex with cubilin (CUBN) and mediates the intestinal absorption of cobalamin by endocytosis. The CUBN/AMN complex is expressed in the ileum and is responsible for the uptake of cobalamin from the diet.

- c.754G>A (p.Gly252Ser) - rs121909301
- c.1313A>G (p.Asp438Gly) - rs61751465

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There have been no reported somatic mutations in the AMN gene.

## Related Disease
- Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome (OMIM #261100)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome involves lifelong administration of intramuscular injections or high oral doses of cobalamin. With treatment, the cobalamin deficiency can be corrected and the symptoms of the condition can be improved. 

## Drug Response
There have been no reported drug responses specific to the AMN gene.
