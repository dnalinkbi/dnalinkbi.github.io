# Gene RGMA

## Genetic Position
The RGMA gene is located on chromosome 15, specifically at position 15q22.31.

## Pathology
Research has linked the RGMA gene to several pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological disorders. The gene is thought to play a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.

## Function for Gene
RGMA encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that acts as a repulsive guidance cue during axon guidance in the developing nervous system.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Further research is needed to determine the best treatment options for pathologies associated with the RGMA gene. However, current studies suggest that targeting RGMA signaling could be a potential therapeutic approach for treating certain cancers and neurological disorders.

## Drug Response
Studies suggest that inhibitors targeting RGMA signaling may be effective in treating glioblastoma and other cancers.
