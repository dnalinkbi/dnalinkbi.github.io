## Gene RAD51B

RAD51B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination. It is located at the genomic position 14q24.1.

### Function for gene

The RAD51B protein is a member of the RAD51 protein family, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair by homologous recombination. RAD51B is involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, which can be caused by various factors including ionizing radiation or chemicals.

### Related disease

Mutations in RAD51B have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer. It has been proposed as a potential susceptibility gene for familial breast cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for individuals with mutations in RAD51B may vary depending on the type and stage of cancer. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

### Drug response

There is limited information on drug response and RAD51B mutations. However, some studies have suggested that RAD51B-deficient cells may have increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.
