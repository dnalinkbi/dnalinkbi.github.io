# Gene MMP3

## Genetic Position
The gene MMP3 (Matrix Metallopeptidase 3) is located on chromosome 11q22.3.

## Pathology
MMP3 encodes for an enzyme called stromelysin-1, which is a type of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). MMPs are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen, during processes such as embryonic development, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. Overactive MMP3 has been implicated in various pathological processes such as cancer metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis. 

## Function
MMP3 is involved in breaking down ECM proteins, particularly collagen, leading to tissue remodeling. It plays an important role in mammary gland development, wound healing, and angiogenesis.

## Related Disease
MMP3 is associated with various diseases, including cancer, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of MMP3 have been identified in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and in patients with cancer metastasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
MMP3 inhibitors are being studied as a potential therapeutic target for various diseases, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The overexpression of MMP3 can lead to poor prognosis in cancer patients.

## Drug Response
MMP3 inhibitors, such as marimastat and minocycline, have been shown to have anti-tumor effects in preclinical studies.
