## Information on Gene HNF4A

* **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 20, 20q13.12.
* **Pathology**: HNF4A gene mutations have been associated with different diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, MODY1 (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young), Fanconi syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
* **Function**: HNF4A gene encodes for a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in liver and pancreatic development, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and cell differentiation.

**External IDs**
* Gene ID: 3172
* Genomic location: NC_000020.11
* Aliases: FRTS4, HNF4, HNF4alpha, NR2A1

**Treatment and Prognosis**
There is currently no specific treatment for HNF4A gene mutations, but proper diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus type 2 and other associated diseases can help improve prognosis.

**Drug Response**
Studies have shown that HNF4A gene mutations can affect the response to drugs used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2, such as sulfonylureas.

**Instructions**<br>
To retrieve information on a gene, provide the gene name as input to the appropriate gene databases such as NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, and HGNC. Searches can be done using gene symbol, gene ID or a combination of both. Detailed information on the gene such as genomic location, aliases, and related diseases can be obtained from these databases. To retrieve information on genetic variations in the gene, provide the gene name and the variant of interest as input to SNP databases such as dbSNP. Information on drug response and related studies can be found using PubMed or Google Scholar with appropriate keywords.
