## Information about Gene CA8

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: CA8 is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 at position 22.2.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the CA8 gene are associated with cerebellar ataxia, an inherited disorder that affects movement and coordination.
- **Function for Gene**: CA8 encodes for carbonic anhydrase VIII, which is an enzyme that helps regulate pH in the cerebellum and other areas of the brain.
