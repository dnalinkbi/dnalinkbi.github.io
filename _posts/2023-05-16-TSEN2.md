# Information about Gene TSEN2

## Basic Information
- **Gene Name:** TSEN2
- **Aliases:** BAA99061.1
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 3: 121,952,487 - 121,962,839
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 10912 
    - NCBI Entrez: 80741 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000129370 
    - OMIM: 616846 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9GZX6
    
## Function
The TSEN2 gene encodes a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is responsible for removing introns from tRNA molecules.

## Mutation Information
- **AA Mutation List:** Several non-synonymous mutations have been reported in TSEN2, including:
    - p.Leu47Pro (rs140164637)
    - p.Cys125Arg (rs398123478)
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs140164637, rs398123478

## Related Diseases
Mutations in TSEN2 have been associated with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2B (PCH2B), which is a rare neurological disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for PCH2B. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms, which can vary widely depending on the severity and age of onset of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically approved for the treatment of PCH2B. However, various medications and therapies may be used to address specific symptoms, such as seizures or spasticity.
