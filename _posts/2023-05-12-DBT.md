## Gene DBT

### Genetic Position and Pathology
The DBT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p21.3). Mutations in this gene have been linked to a rare genetic disorder called Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). MSUD is an autosomal recessive disease that affects the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids.

### Function for Gene
The DBT gene encodes for the E2 subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH), which is involved in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The BCKDH complex catalyzes the second step in the catabolism of BCAAs, allowing for their conversion into energy.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the DBT gene.

### Related Disease
Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is the related disease caused by mutations in the DBT gene. MSUD is a rare genetic disorder where the body is unable to break down certain amino acids, leading to a buildup of toxic substances in the blood.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for MSUD typically involves a strict diet low in BCAAs to prevent the accumulation of toxic substances. Without treatment, MSUD can lead to developmental delays, seizures, and even death.

### Drug Response
There is currently no reported drug response for the DBT gene.
