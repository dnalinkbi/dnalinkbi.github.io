# Gene: CEBPA

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 19: 35,717,369 - 35,798,131
- **Pathology:** Mutations in CEBPA have been associated with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
- **Function:** CEBPA encodes a transcription factor that regulates myeloid cell differentiation.
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 1830, NCBI Entrez: 1050, Ensembl: ENSG00000139737, OMIM: 116897, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49715
- **Aliases:** C/EBP-alpha, CEBP, CEBP-alpha, CRP1

## Mutations
### AA Mutation List
- p.Arg312Cys (R312C) with dbSNP ID: rs74315306
- p.Thr279Lys (T279K) with dbSNP ID: rs74315305

### Mutation Type
- Somatic mutations

## Related Disease
