## Gene UTRN

### Basic Information
- Gene: UTRN (utrophin)
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 6 (6q24.2)
- Aliases: DRP, DMDL, DMDL1, DMDL2, MDCR, UTRN-A, UTRN-B, UTRN-C
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 12654
    - NCBI Entrez: 7402
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000112280
    - OMIM: 601411
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13433

### Function of Gene
- The utrophin gene encodes for a member of the dystrophin protein family. The protein is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of skeletal muscle and is involved in the maintenance and repair of muscle fibers. It interacts with actin and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

### Mutations
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - p.Phe57Cys, missense, rs758886544
    - p.Leu400Pro, missense, rs750518208
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Not available.
    
### Related Disease
- The absence or deficiency of utrophin in humans is associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive muscle-wasting disease.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Utrophin upregulation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for DMD. Several experimental drugs are being developed to increase levels of utrophin in skeletal muscles.
- The prognosis for individuals with DMD is poor, as the disease is currently incurable and usually fatal in early adulthood.

### Drug Response
- Experimental drugs targeting utrophin upregulation, such as SMT C1100 and ezutromid, have shown promising results in preclinical studies and early clinical trials.
