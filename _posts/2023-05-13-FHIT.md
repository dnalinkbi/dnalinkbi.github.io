## Gene FHIT

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 3p14.2  
**Pathology:** Loss or abnormality of FHIT gene has been associated with various types of cancer, including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer.

### Function

The FHIT gene encodes a protein known as Fragile Histidine Triad (FHIT) which has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

### Related Diseases

FHIT gene abnormality or inactivation is associated with various types of cancer, including:

- Lung cancer
- Breast cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Esophageal cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Colorectal cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for cancer associated with FHIT gene abnormality depends on the type and stage of cancer. For advanced stage cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are commonly used. However, the overall prognosis is often poor in these cases.

### Drug Response

- Gemcitabine
- EGFR inhibitors
