## Information about Gene HNMT

### Genetic Position
- Gene: HNMT
- Chromosome: 2
- Chromosomal location: 2q22.1

### Pathology
- HNMT gene is associated with migraine with aura in females. 
- Decreased HNMT activity contributes to higher histamine levels in the brain leading to migraine attacks. 

### Function
- The HNMT gene encodes histamine N-methyltransferase enzyme, which is responsible for the metabolism of histamine in the body. 
- The enzyme converts histamine to N-methylhistamine, which gets excreted in the urine.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 5007
- NCBI Entrez ID: 3176
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163536
- OMIM ID: 605238
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P50135
- Aliases: HMT

### AA Mutation List
- p.Arg3Trp(rs11558538)
- p.Arg208His(rs11558596)
- p.Arg217Gln(rs11558597)
- p.Ile314Val(rs11558599)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs1801105
- rs11558538
- rs11558596

### Related Disease
- Migraine with aura

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Histamine blockers, such as antihistamines can help in reducing histamine level and symptoms of migraine. 
- Prognosis of migraine with aura associated with HNMT gene is considered good with proper management.

### Drug Response
- HNMT gene can affect the response to histamine and other drugs that act on the histamine system.
