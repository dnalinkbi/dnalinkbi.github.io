## Gene TRIM33

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1; 198,743,882-198,983,240

**Pathology:** Mutations in TRIM33 have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer.

**Function:** TRIM33 encodes for a protein called TIF1γ, which acts as a transcriptional co-repressor in various cellular processes such as DNA damage response, gene regulation, and differentiation.

- c.1172-2A>G (splice site variant) with dbSNP ID: rs869025086

**Related Disease:** TRIM33 has been associated with several types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no specific treatment for mutations in TRIM33. The prognosis of TRIM33-associated cancer depends on various factors such as the type and stage of cancer and individual health.

**Drug Response:** There is no information available on drug response related to TRIM33 mutations.
