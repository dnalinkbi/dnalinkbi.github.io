## Gene Information for GRIP1

### Genetic Position
Gene: GRIP1 (Glutamate Receptor Interacting Protein 1)

Location: Chromosome 12q13.2

### Pathology
GRIP1 is associated with multiple diseases and pathologies. Its dysregulation has been linked to breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Several studies have shown GRIP1 to play a crucial role in energy homeostasis, glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity.

### Function
GRIP1 is involved in a variety of cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, endosomal trafficking and dendrite formation. It serves as an adapter protein that interacts with several transcription factors and membrane receptors, allowing for the crosstalk between these signaling pathways. It is also involved in the post-translational modification of receptor trafficking, leading to changes in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation.
