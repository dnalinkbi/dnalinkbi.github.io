# Information about Gene SCA25 
## Genetic Position 
Gene SCA25 is located on chromosome 2q33.1 and spans 119,942 base pairs.

## Pathology 
SCA25 is associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia, a neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of coordination and balance.

## Function 
The function of the SCA25 gene is currently unknown, although it is thought to play a role in cerebellar function.
