## Gene: SCNN1B 

### Information 

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 16: 68,932,538-68,955,799 

**Pathology:** Mutations in this gene are associated with Liddle syndrome (a rare form of hypertension) and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (an inherited disorder of electrolyte imbalance).

**Function:** The SCNN1B gene is involved in the regulation of sodium transport in various tissues, including the kidney, lung, and colon. It encodes the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) superfamily.

**Aliases:** ENaC-beta, SCNEB 

**External IDs:** 

- HGNC: 10663 
- NCBI Entrez: 6338 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000103084 
- OMIM: 600760 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51168 

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 

- p.Asp561Asn (rs137853601): missense mutation associated with Liddle syndrome 
- p.Thr594Ala (rs137853600): missense mutation associated with Liddle syndrome 
- p.Asp602Gly (rs137853599): missense mutation associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported 

**Related disease:** Liddle syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options for Liddle syndrome include medications to control blood pressure, such as diuretics and beta-blockers, and lifestyle changes such as exercise and a low-sodium diet. Individuals with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 may require lifelong mineralocorticoid replacement therapy along with a low-sodium diet. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the success of treatment.

**Drug response:** In some cases, Liddle syndrome may be responsive to the drugs amiloride and triamterene, which block the activity of ENaC.
