# Information about Gene UOX

## Pathology and Function
The gene UOX, also known as urate oxidase, is involved in the metabolism of purines and is responsible for the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene have been linked to hyperuricemia, gout, and renal damage.

## Gene Information
- Function: Catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin in the presence of molecular oxygen and an electron acceptor.
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 7374
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 1, 26.23 Mb
    - Aliases: UOX, UO
- External Sites:
    - HGNC: 12564
    - NCBI Entrez: 7405
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000117309
    - OMIM: 191540
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P00366

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: V14L, A77T, P98S, Q137R
- Mutation type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs121907960, rs121907961, rs28931576, rs743155

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are numerous somatic SNVs and InDels in the UOX gene, however, there are no reported dbSNP IDs.

## Related Disease
- Hyperuricemia
- Gout
- Renal Damage

## Treatment and Prognosis
Hyperuricemia and gout can be treated with medications that act to decrease serum uric acid levels, such as allopurinol or febuxostat. However, long-term prognosis may be poor if the underlying condition causing hyperuricemia is not managed.

## Drug Response
Individuals with certain UOX mutations may have altered drug responses to medications that affect uric acid levels. For example, those with UOX mutations may have reduced efficacy or experience side effects from allopurinol.
