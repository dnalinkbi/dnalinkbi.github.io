# Gene S100A7

## Genetic Position
The S100A7 gene is located on chromosome 1p21.3.

## Pathology
The S100A7 gene is associated with various pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin disorders.

## Function
The S100A7 gene encodes for a small calcium-binding protein called psoriasin. The function of psoriasin is to regulate immune response by activating pro-inflammatory pathways.
