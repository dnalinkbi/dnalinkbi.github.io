## Gene: SLC17A8 

### Genetic Position

The SLC17A8 gene is located on chromosome 4q28.3.

### Pathology

Mutations in the SLC17A8 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

### Function

The SLC17A8 gene encodes a solute carrier protein that is involved in the transport of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, into synaptic vesicles in neurons.
