# Information about gene GSDME

## Genetic Position
Gene name: GSDME

Chromosome: 11

Location: 11q22.3

## Pathology and Function
GSDME (Gasdermin E) is a member of the gasdermin family of proteins. This gene is involved in the process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. GSDME plays an important role in the cleavage and release of IL-1β and IL-18 in response to both infection and sterile inflammation.

## Related Disease
GSDME has been implicated in several diseases including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and deafness.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for GSDME-associated diseases, but targeting the IL-1β and IL-18 pathways could be a potential therapeutic approach.

Prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the disease associated with GSDME.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response for GSDME-associated diseases.
