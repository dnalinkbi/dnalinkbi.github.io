# Gene: NR1I3

## Introduction
NR1I3 gene is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily which plays a critical role in regulating the expression of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. This gene has been associated with many diseases and drug response.

## Function
NR1I3 gene encodes the protein known as the pregnane X receptor (PXR). PXR is a transcriptional regulator that controls the metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics and drugs by regulating the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in the liver and intestine.

## Related Disease
NR1I3 gene has been associated with many diseases such as colon cancer, prostate cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for NR1I3-related diseases vary depending on the specific disease and individual patient factors.

## Drug Response
NR1I3 gene has been associated with drug responses. For example, PXR activation can induce drug resistance by altering the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
