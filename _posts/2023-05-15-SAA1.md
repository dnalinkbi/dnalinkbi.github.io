# Information about Gene SAA1

## Gene Position
The SAA1 gene is located on chromosome 11q12.1.

## Pathology
The SAA1 gene encodes serum amyloid A (SAA), a protein produced in response to inflammation. Mutations in SAA1 have been associated with amyloidosis, a disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in various organs and tissues.

## Function
The SAA1 gene encodes a protein called serum amyloid A (SAA), which is a major acute-phase protein in humans. SAA is produced in response to inflammatory stimuli and circulates in the blood. It has been shown to have pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic properties.

## AA Mutation List

| Amino Acid | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Phe 57     | Missense      | rs1130864 |
| Tyr 75     | Missense      | rs4691659 |
| Ala 76     | Missense      | rs1044945 |
| Leu 110    | Missense      | rs17577   |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels identified in the SAA1 gene. Examples include:
- c.149A>G (p.Tyr50Cys)
- c.224G>A (p.Ala75Thr)
- c.227A>C (p.Asn76His)

## Related Disease
Mutations in SAA1 have been associated with various forms of amyloidosis, including:
- Familial Mediterranean fever-associated amyloidosis
- Hereditary renal amyloidosis
- AA amyloidosis

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for amyloidosis vary depending on the subtype and severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response of SAA1 mutations.
