# Information about gene SETDB1

## Genetic position
The SETDB1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 in humans, specifically at the position 1q21.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SETDB1 gene have been associated with various diseases, including:
- Schizophrenia: variations in SETDB1 expression have been identified in patients with schizophrenia based on post-mortem brain tissue studies.
- Intellectual disability: heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SETDB1 have been found to contribute to developmental delay and intellectual disability.
- Cancer: SETDB1 has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of several types of cancer, including breast, lung, and liver cancer.

## Function
SETDB1 encodes a histone methyltransferase, which plays a critical role in gene regulation by modifying chromatin structure. Specifically, SETDB1 catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), leading to transcriptional repression of target genes.

- c.3823T>A: missense mutation, dbSNP ID rs886041387

## Related disease
As mentioned earlier, SETDB1 mutations have been linked to various diseases, including schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no targeted treatment for diseases resulting from SETDB1 mutations. Treatment options for cancers involving SETDB1 dysregulation may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Prognosis is highly variable and depends on various factors such as the type and stage of the disease.

## Drug response
Studies have shown that SETDB1 can play a role in resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin. As such, downregulation of SETDB1 expression (through methods such as RNA interference) may enhance drug sensitivity in cancer treatment.
