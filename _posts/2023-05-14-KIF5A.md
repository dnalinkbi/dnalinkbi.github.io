# Gene KIF5A

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12q13.33

## Pathology
KIF5A gene is known to cause autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia (SPG10), a hereditary condition characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of the lower extremities. Rare mutations in KIF5A have also been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and hereditary sensory neuropathy.

## Function
KIF5A encodes a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-associated molecular motors. It is involved in intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles, such as synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, and endosomes.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala361Val, missense, rs121912669
- p.Arg439Gln, missense, rs1057516491
- p.Glu236Lys, missense, rs398122972
- p.Ile360Thr, missense, rs1057516490

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic variants in KIF5A.

## Related Disease
- Spastic paraplegia, autosomal dominant, type 10 (SPG10)
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
- Hereditary sensory neuropathy

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for SPG10 or other neurodegenerative diseases associated with KIF5A mutations. Treatment options focus on controlling symptoms, such as spasticity and muscle weakness, with medications and physical therapy.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that targets KIF5A directly. However, some medications can improve symptoms of spasticity and muscle weakness in patients with SPG10 and other neurodegenerative diseases.
