# Gene GULOP

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 9: 139,120,652-139,276,901
- **Pathology:** No known pathology
- **Function for gene:** GULOP (Glucosylceramidase-like Opioid Peptide) is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 30 family. It encodes for the enzyme Î²-glucosidase 2 which hydrolyses glucosylceramide, a glycosphingolipid involved in cell signaling and cellular processes.
