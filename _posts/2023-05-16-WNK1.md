## Gene WNK1

### Genetic position

WNK1 (With No lysine [K] Kinase 1) gene is located on chromosome 12 (12p13.33) and it spans 433,655 base pairs.

### Pathology

WNK1 is involved in several physiological processes such as ion transport, cell signaling, and blood pressure regulation. Mutations in this gene have been reported to be associated with a type of hereditary hypertension (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) and hereditary sensory neuropathy type II.

### Function

The WNK1 protein is a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of ion channels and transporters in the kidney and other tissues. It also acts as a signaling molecule for the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and migration.

The somatic mutations in WNK1 gene with dbSNP ID are as follows:

- rs201785466: G>A, p.Asn118Asp
- rs34644463: G>A, p.Glu180Lys
- rs139181163: G>A, p.Gly222Arg
- rs780676362: C>T, p.Ser240Phe

### Related Disease

Mutations in the WNK1 gene have been associated with hereditary hypertension (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) and hereditary sensory neuropathy type II.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific genetic mutation and the associated disease. In general, there is no cure for genetic diseases caused by WNK1 mutations. Treatment options may include medication to control blood pressure and symptom management.

### Drug Response

Studies have suggested that WNK1 inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of hypertension.
