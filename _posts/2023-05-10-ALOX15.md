# Gene ALOX15

**Genetic Position:** The ALOX15 gene is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17p13.1.

**Pathology:** ALOX15 gene is involved in the production of ALOX15 enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Dysregulation of ALOX15 gene has been associated with various diseases including asthma, atherosclerosis, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.

**Function:** The ALOX15 gene provides instructions for making the ALOX15 enzyme, which is involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) from arachidonic acid.

**Related Disease:** 
Alterations in the ALOX15 gene have been associated with various diseases including Asthma, Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Prostate Cancer.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with the ALOX15 gene depend on the specific disease and the severity of the condition. Further research is required to develop targeted therapies against ALOX15-related diseases.

**Drug Response:** The response to drugs targeting the ALOX15 gene varies depending on the drug, the specific disease, and the patient.
