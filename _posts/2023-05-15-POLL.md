## Gene: POLL

- **Function for gene**: POLL (DNA-directed DNA polymerase lambda) is a member of the X family of DNA polymerases, which is involved in base excision repair, non-homologous end joining, and translesion DNA synthesis.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: 
    - Gene ID: 27343
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 10 (NC_000010.11)
    - Aliases: DNA polymerase lambda, POLH
- **External sites**: 
    - HGNC: 9037
    - NCBI Entrez: 27343
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000198242
    - OMIM: 610042
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UBT6
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: There are several reported mutations in the POLL gene associated with cancer and genetic disorders. Some examples are:
    - c.102C>G (p.Pro34Arg) - rs3092985
