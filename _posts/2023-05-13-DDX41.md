# Information about Gene DDX41

DDX41 is a protein-coding gene that encodes a member of the DEAD-box protein family. It plays an essential role in RNA processing and is highly conserved across species. The gene is located on chromosome 5q35.3 and has a length of 58,169 base pairs.

## Function of Gene DDX41

DDX41 is involved in regulating the processing of RNA transcripts in the nucleus. It specifically recognizes and binds to pre-mRNA with intronic polyadenylation signals and promotes their splicing and export to the cytoplasm. It also facilitates the removal of introns from pre-mRNA through its interaction with spliceosomes. Additionally, DDX41 has been implicated in DNA repair processes.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000114209
- OMIM: 615278
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96T37

The genomic location of the DDX41 gene is 5q35.3. It is also known by the following aliases: DRHX, DEAD/H-box helicase 41, and DKFZp434D1824.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several missense mutations in the DDX41 gene that have been reported in various databases such as dbSNP. These mutations affect the coding region of the gene and result in changes to the amino acid sequence of the protein. Some examples of these mutations include:

- p.Arg525Cys (rs140858928)
- p.Arg525His (rs201930168)
- p.Asp140Gly (rs778271187)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Various somatic mutations in the DDX41 gene have been reported in different types of cancers. These mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are not present in their germline DNA. Some examples of somatic mutations in DDX41 and their dbSNP IDs include:

- c.2074C>T (rs889025683)
- c.1525G>A (rs200857923)
- c.1525G>T (rs754781845)

## Related Disease

Germline mutations in DDX41 have been associated with a rare form of blood cancer known as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and lead to a predisposition to developing these types of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There are currently no targeted treatments for MDS and AML associated with DDX41 mutations. Treatment options for these conditions typically include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation. The prognosis for individuals with DDX41-associated MDS and AML varies depending on several factors, including the age of onset, disease severity, and response to treatment.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on the drug response of individuals with DDX41 mutations. Some studies have suggested that certain chemotherapy agents may be less effective in these individuals compared to those without DDX41 mutations.
