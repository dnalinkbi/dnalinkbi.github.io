## Gene: GSE1

### Information:

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 4; 4q21.21
- **Pathology:** No direct association with any disease
- **Function:** GTP-binding protein GSE1 regulates cell growth and apoptosis through the PI3K-AKT signal pathway. It interacts with and stabilizes AKT1 and promotes its translocation to the cell membrane, leading to the activation of AKT1-dependent cell survival signal.

### External IDs and Aliases:

- HGNC ID: 11049
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 55685
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000138679
- OMIM ID: -
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8TCU4
- Aliases: KIAA1529, C4orf9

### Genetic Variations:

- **AA mutation list:** Missense mutation p.Gly106Ser
- **Mutation type:** SNP
- **dbSNP ID:** rs1801602

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** -
- **dbSNP ID:** -

### Related Disease:

There is no direct association of GSE1 with any genetic disease. However, studies have established its role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is implicated in various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

### Treatment and Prognosis:

As there is no direct association of GSE1 with any genetic disease, there is no specific treatment or prognosis related to it.

### Drug Response:

As there is no direct association of GSE1 with any genetic disease, there is no information available on drug response related to GSE1.
