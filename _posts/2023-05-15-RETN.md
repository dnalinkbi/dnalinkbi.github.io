## Gene RETN

**Function:** The RETN gene encodes for resistin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue that plays a role in insulin resistance and inflammation.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 9963
- NCBI Entrez: 56729
- Ensembl: ENSG00000176724
- OMIM: 605557
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HD89

**Aliases:** ADSF, FIZZ3, RETN1

**AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID and Mutation Type:**

No pathogenic variants are reported in ClinVar, and no variations affecting the protein sequence have been reported in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

None reported in dbSNP

**Related Diseases:**

Several studies have reported associations between RETN variations and metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is currently no specific treatment based on RETN variants, but some studies suggest that modulation of resistin levels, or its signaling pathways, may be a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders.

**Drug Response:**

No known drugs target RETN, but several studies have explored the potential effect of different drugs on resistin levels and insulin resistance.
