# Gene BCL9

## Genetic Position 
The BCL9 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q21.2.

## Pathology and Function
The BCL9 gene encodes a transcriptional co-activator protein that is involved in the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The BCL9 protein interacts with beta-catenin and enhances its transcriptional activity leading to activation of downstream target genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling due to mutations or aberrant expression of BCL9 has been associated with cancer progression and metastasis.

## Related Disease
Genetic alterations in the BCL9 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers, including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Due to its role in regulating Wnt signaling pathway, targeting BCL9 have been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, no drugs have been developed specifically targeting BCL9 yet. The prognosis of cancer patients with BCL9 alterations depends on the cancer type and stage.

## Drug Response
There is no information available regarding drugs affecting the BCL9 protein.
