# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene TNFSF4

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** TNFSF4
- **Function:** TNFSF4 is a cytokine that plays a role in lymphocyte activation. It is involved in the regulation of T-cell-dependent immune responses and may also be important in the regulation of autoimmune diseases.
- **External IDs:** 
    * HGNC: 11925
    * NCBI Entrez Gene: 7292
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000110053
    * OMIM: 601042
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43557
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1q25.3

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:**
    * p.Ala87Ser
    * p.Val90Ala
    * p.Leu102Pro
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs1077667, rs1234311, rs17568

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- **dbSNP ID:** None reported in COSMIC database as of August 2021

## Related Diseases
- Rheumatoid arthritis: TNFSF4 has been associated with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. 
- Systemic lupus erythematosus: TNFSF4 has also been implicated in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- TNFSF4 may be a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
- Studies have shown that targeting TNFSF4 signaling can have a beneficial effect on disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

## Drug Response
- Abatacept, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, targets TNFSF4 signaling and has shown to be effective in reducing disease activity.
