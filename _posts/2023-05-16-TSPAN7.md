## Information about gene TSPAN7

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: X
- Position: 128,205,322 - 128,219,455 

### Pathology
- Mutations in TSPAN7 have been associated with X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) and MRXS3 (Mental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic 3).

### Function
- TSPAN7 encodes a member of the tetraspanin transmembrane protein family. The protein is thought to be involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

### External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 7102
- HGNC: 11815
- Ensembl: ENSG00000158510
- OMIM: 300341
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15341
- Aliases: DXS1692E, TALLA-1, TM4SF2

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Not available

### Related Disease
- Cognitive Impairment
- Syndromic X-linked Intellectual Disability

### Treatment and prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for X-linked Intellectual Disability. Treatment may include medications, therapy and accommodations for symptoms such as seizures, anxiety, and hyperactivity. 
- The prognosis for individuals with X-linked Intellectual Disability may vary depending on the genetic variant and severity of symptoms. 

### Drug response
