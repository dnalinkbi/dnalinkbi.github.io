## Gene Information: SLC28A3

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 15
- Location: 15q24.2

### Pathology
- SLC28A3 gene is associated with the increased risk of colorectal cancer.

### Function
- SLC28A3 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the concentrative nucleoside transporter family. This protein is involved in the transport of nucleosides across the membrane.
