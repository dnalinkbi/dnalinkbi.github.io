## Gene information on NPAS2

### Genetic Position
NPAS2 gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q11.2).

### Pathology
NPAS2 gene is associated with psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Several studies have shown that variants of NPAS2 are associated with the risk of developing these disorders.

### Function
NPAS2 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological and behavioral processes. It has been shown to be involved in regulating circadian rhythms, sleep, and metabolism.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense variants of NPAS2 gene, which are associated with psychiatric disorders. Some of the variants along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID are:
- T1017I, Missense, rs35678
- R449H, Missense, rs13022567
- R785H, Missense, rs35678

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are few somatic SNVs/InDels reported in NPAS2 gene with dbSNP ID.

### Related disease
Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are the most commonly studied psychiatric disorders associated with NPAS2 gene.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for NPAS2 gene-related disorders. However, early diagnosis and proper pharmacological treatment may help in reducing the severity and symptoms of these disorders.

### Drug response
The response to drugs for NPAS2-associated psychiatric disorders is not well studied. However, several drugs targeting circadian rhythm and sleep disturbances may be beneficial in individuals with these disorders.
