## Gene GABRA6

### Genetic position
The GABRA6 gene is located on chromosome 5 at the position 34.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the GABRA6 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders including epilepsy, alcoholism, and addiction.

### Function
The GABRA6 gene encodes for a subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor. This receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal excitability in the central nervous system.

### Related disease
- Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy 2 (ADNFLE2)
- Alcohol dependence (AD)
- Opioid dependence (OD)

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for genetic disorders caused by GABRA6 mutations. Treatment options mainly focus on managing symptoms and include antiepileptic drugs for those with epilepsy and counseling for those with addiction disorders.

### Drug response
Several studies have reported that benzodiazepines and certain anticonvulsants targeting GABA-A receptors can be effective in the treatment of epilepsy and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
