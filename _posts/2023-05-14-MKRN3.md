# Information about Gene MKRN3

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 15
- Location: 15q11.2
- Genomic position: 20,889,896-20,908,153

## Pathology
- Mutations in MKRN3 have been associated with central precocious puberty (CPP) [1].
- Loss-of-function mutations in MKRN3 result in early onset of puberty due to loss of inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis [2].

## Function for Gene
- MKRN3 (Makorin Ring Finger Protein 3) is a protein coding gene that plays a role in the regulation of hormone secretion from the pituitary gland [3].
- It acts as a negative regulator of the HPG axis, inhibiting the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) [4].
- The protein is involved in protein ubiquitination, or the process of modifying a protein by attaching ubiquitin molecules to it, which can lead to degradation [5].

## External IDs, Aliases and Sites
- Gene ID: 154058
- HGNC ID: 29272
- Ensembl gene ID: ENSG00000182544
- OMIM ID: 603969
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q96EB6
- Aliases: ZNF127L1, ZNF127L2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- MKRN3 mutations in central precocious puberty are mostly nonsense or frameshift mutations resulting in a predicted truncated protein with a premature stop codon [6].
- Some examples of these mutations are: 
    - c.109C>T (p.Arg37Ter) (dbSNP ID: rs368817352)
    - c.118C>T (p.Gln40Ter) (dbSNP ID: rs368817355)
    - c.1577delC (p.Pro526LeufsTer3) (dbSNP ID: rs757680600)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for MKRN3 in the COSMIC database.
- However, somatic mutations in MKRN3 have been associated with Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer [7].

## Related Disease
- Mutations in MKRN3 have been associated with central precocious puberty (CPP), a condition in which puberty begins before the age of 8 in girls and before the age of 9 in boys [8].
- CPP can lead to decreased height due to early closure of growth plates and may cause psychological and social issues in affected children [9].

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for central precocious puberty may involve medication to suppress HPG axis activity, with GnRH agonists being the mainstay of therapy [10].
- The prognosis for CPP is generally good, as long as the underlying condition causing it is properly treated [11].

## Drug Response
- In a study of 47 girls with MKRN3 mutations and CPP, treatment with a GnRH agonist was found to effectively suppress LH and FSH secretion and delay pubertal development [12].
