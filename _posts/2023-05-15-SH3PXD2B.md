## Gene Information

The gene SH3PXD2B, also known as Tks4, is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q33.2). It encodes for the SH3 and PX domain-containing protein 2B.

## Function

SH3PXD2B plays an important role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. It is involved in the formation of invadopodia, which are protrusions that facilitate the invasion of cancer cells into surrounding tissues. SH3PXD2B also regulates the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions, which are structures that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

Several somatic SNVs and InDels in the SH3PXD2B gene have been identified in various cancers, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the SH3PXD2B gene have been associated with various diseases, including craniofacial anomalies and cancer. In particular, SH3PXD2B has been linked to the invasive and metastatic behavior of cancer cells.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Targeting SH3PXD2B may have therapeutic potential in inhibiting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, further research is needed to develop effective treatments targeting SH3PXD2B.

## Drug Response
