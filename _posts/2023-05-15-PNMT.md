# Information about the PNMT gene

## Gene information

- **Gene name:** PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase)
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC ID: HGNC:9006 
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 5409 
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000198526 
    - OMIM ID: 171155 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P11086
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 17q21.32
- **Aliases:** PENT, PNMT1

## Function

The PNMT gene encodes the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), which is responsible for the conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. Epinephrine acts as a hormone and a neurotransmitter, helping the body respond to stress.

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list:** A list of amino acid mutations in the PNMT gene can be found on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot website.
- **Mutation types:** Missense mutations, frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations have been reported in the PNMT gene.
- **dbSNP ID:** dbSNP is a database of common genetic variants. Some of the PNMT mutations have dbSNP IDs assigned to them.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- **dbSNP ID:** Somatic mutations in the PNMT gene have been reported, and some of them have dbSNP IDs.

## Related disease

- Mutations in the PNMT gene have been linked to a rare condition called familial dysautonomia (FD), also known as Riley-Day syndrome. FD is characterized by abnormal development and function of the autonomic nervous system, which controls automatic body functions such as breathing, heart rate, and digestion.

## Treatment and prognosis

- There is no cure for familial dysautonomia, but treatment is focused on managing symptoms. Patients may require continuous care and monitoring throughout their lives.
- The prognosis for FD varies depending on the severity of symptoms and complications.

## Drug response

- There is limited information available about drug response specifically related to PNMT mutations.
