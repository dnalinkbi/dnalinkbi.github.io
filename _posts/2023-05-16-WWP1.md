## Gene: WWP1 

### Information:

- Function: WWP1 gene encodes for a protein called NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase WWP1, which plays a role in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, specifically in the regulation of endocytic trafficking and degradation of a variety of receptors.

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    - No common AA mutations are reported in the WWP1 gene. 

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported yet for WWP1 gene. 

- Related disease: 
    - Studies suggest a role of WWP1 in various diseases including cancer and neurological disorders. 
        - Neurological disorders: WWP1 has been implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a spinocerebellar ataxia, which is caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the ataxin-3 gene. Studies suggest that WWP1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Ataxin-3 is impaired in patients with SCA3, leading to the accumulation of mutant Ataxin-3 and neuronal toxicity. 
        - Cancer: WWP1 is implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancer types including breast cancer, lung cancer and gastric cancer, via its role in regulating the ubiquitination and degradation of several signaling proteins, such as PTEN, TGFβR and EGFR. 

- Treatment and prognosis: 
    - Due to the involvement of WWP1 in several disease processes, it could be a potential therapeutic target for these diseases. However, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of specifically targeting WWP1 for therapeutic intervention.

- Drug response: 
    - Currently, there are no drugs approved specifically targeting WWP1.
