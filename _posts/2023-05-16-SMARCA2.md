### Gene SMARCA2

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 9 (9p24.3)
- **Function for Gene:** SMARCA2 encodes for a protein called BRG1, which is a member of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. BRG1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by altering chromatin structure.
- **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location:** 
      - HGNC: 11197
      - NCBI Entrez: 6595
      - Ensembl: ENSG00000148498
      - OMIM: 600014
      - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51531
- **Aliases:** BRM/SWI2-related gene 1 protein, hBRM, SNF2alpha, SMARCA4
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
      - p.R116C (rs1064795116) - missense mutation
      - p.R561C (rs376252356) - missense mutation
      - p.R770Q (rs145493810) - missense mutation
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
      - c.655C>T (rs142505069) - missense mutation
      - c.302A>G (rs114574090) - missense mutation
- **Related Disease:** SMARCA2 mutations have been associated with Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, sparse hair, and distinctive facial features.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and providing supportive care.
- **Drug Response:** No drugs have been specifically developed to target SMARCA2 mutations.
