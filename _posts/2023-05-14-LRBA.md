# Gene LRBA

LRBA (lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor protein) is a gene located on chromosome 4, specifically on position q31.3. This gene encodes for a protein that plays a critical role in the proper function of the immune system. It belongs to the family of WD repeat-containing proteins and was first identified in humans by Vendrame et al. in 2006.

## Function

The LRBA protein is involved in the regulation of various immune cell functions such as differentiation, activation, and survival. It acts as a chaperone for various proteins and helps in their proper folding and trafficking within the cells. Additionally, LRBA plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are essential for immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases.

## Mutations

LRBA gene mutations have been linked to various autoimmune disorders such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).

### AA Mutation list with dbSNP ID

There are several known missense mutations in the LRBA gene that have been identified in patients with autoimmune diseases:

- p.Arg1874Gln (rs61733394)
- p.Ala2093Thr (rs150261986)
- p.Leu2449Gln (rs61737220)
- p.Tyr2616Cys (rs146114266)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is limited information available about somatic mutations in the LRBA gene.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the LRBA gene have been linked to several autoimmune diseases. These include:

- Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
- Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for LRBA-related autoimmune disorders. Treatment primarily relies on supportive care and management of symptoms. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy and immunosuppressive drugs are commonly used to manage the disease. Prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the age at which they first appear.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available about drug response specific to LRBA-related autoimmune disorders.
