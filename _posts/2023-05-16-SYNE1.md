# Gene Information for SYNE1

## Gene Function
The SYNE1 gene encodes a protein called spectrin repeat-containing nuclear envelope protein 1, also known as Nesprin-1. Nesprin-1 is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a role in nuclear movement and positioning, cell division, chromatin organization, and nuclear envelope integrity.

## External IDs and Genomic Location

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 6 (NC_000006.12)
- **Aliases:** MYNE1, Nesprin1, SCA8, C6orf98, KIAA0796

## Related Diseases
Mutations in SYNE1 have been associated with several disorders, including:
- Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN)
- Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD)
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- Down Syndrome (DS)
- Breast cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for genetic disorders caused by SYNE1 mutations and treatment is symptomatic. Management may include physical therapy, assistive devices, and medication to control symptoms, but the prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited information regarding drug response specific to SYNE1 mutations.
