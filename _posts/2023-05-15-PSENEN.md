# Information on Gene PSENEN

## Genetic Position

The PSENEN gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 12.

## Pathology

Mutations in the PSENEN gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.

## Function

The PSENEN gene encodes the presenilin enhancer protein, which is required for the normal processing of amyloid precursor protein, a protein that is involved in the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are multiple pathogenic mutations described for the PSENEN gene leading to Alzheimer's disease. The mutations include insertions, deletions, and missense mutations. Some examples of disease-causing mutations in the PSENEN gene are:

- c.47G>A (p.Gly16Ser) with dbSNP ID rs121917863
- c.65C>T (p.Arg22Ter) with dbSNP ID rs104894752
- c.100_102delAAG (p.Lys34del) with dbSNP ID rs777848307

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Not available.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the PSENEN gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and treatment options are limited. The available treatments focus on symptom management and may include medications to improve cognitive function, behavioral changes, and lifestyle modifications.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available regarding the drug response in individuals carrying mutations in the PSENEN gene.
