# Information about gene MTMR9

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Position**: Chromosome 8: 22,027,238 - 22,211,512
- **Pathology**: Mutations in MTMR9 are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary neurological disorder. 
- **Function**: MTMR9 gene encodes Myotubularin Related Protein 9, which has a phosphatase activity and is involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism.
