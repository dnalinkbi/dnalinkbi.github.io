# Gene UROS

## Information
- **Gene:** UROS
- **Pathology:** Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (also known as Gunther's disease)
- **Function:** The UROS gene encodes an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen III synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of heme. Mutations in UROS lead to decreased activity of this enzyme, causing a buildup of porphyrin precursors and subsequent symptoms of erythropoietic porphyria.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 12570
    - NCBI Entrez: 7390
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000103367
    - OMIM: 613521
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P10746
- **Aliases:** CEP, CP, URO2, UROS1

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:**
    - p.Arg37Trp
    - p.Arg37Gly
    - p.Pro41Leu
    - p.Arg48Cys
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs121912633, rs121912634, rs28940871, rs116780819

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- There are currently no known somatic mutations in UROS

## Related Disease:
- Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment for CEP typically involves phototherapy and/or blood transfusions. Bone marrow transplantation has been successful in some cases, but there is a risk of complications. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and response to treatment.

## Drug Response:
- Afamelanotide has been approved for the treatment of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), another type of porphyria. It is currently being evaluated for the treatment of CEP.
