## Gene information for TTC8:

- Gene function: TTC8 (Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain 8) encodes a protein that plays a role in the assembly and trafficking of cilia along microtubules. It is involved in ciliogenesis and regulation of Hedgehog signaling.

- External IDs and aliases: TTC8 gene is also known as BBS8 ( Bardet-Biedl syndorme 8), FLJ20285, TTC10, MGC12956.

- Genomic location: TTC8 gene is located on chromosome 14q31.3.

- External sites for TTC8:  TTC8 gene information can be found at HGNC (HGNC:17911), NCBI Entrez  (Entrez Gene: 118987), Ensembl (ENSG00000140195), OMIM (OMIM: 608132), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Q8TCU4).

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: Some of the missense mutations associated with TTC8 gene are: L70P (rs377812366), R73W (rs111033587), G102E (rs114673061), P167A (rs193302008). These are all nonsynonymous mutations which lead to altered amino acid sequences in protein structure.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: The somatic mutations in TTC8 gene include rs769400388, rs869320335, rs777327071, which are all reported in Cosmic database.

- Related disease: TTC8 mutations are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder. BBS is characterized by retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, hypogonadism, and kidney abnormalities.

- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment of BBS is mainly symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms.

- Drug response: As of now, there is no specific drug available for the treatment of BBS. However, some of the ongoing clinical trials are targeting the genetic mutations that cause BBS.
