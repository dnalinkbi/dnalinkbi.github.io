## Gene TRA

### Genetic position 

The gene TRA is located on chromosome 14q11.2 and its genomic position is from 21,202,760 to 21,213,412 bp.

### Pathology

TRA gene is associated with several diseases such as T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Multiple Sclerosis, and Psoriasis.

### Function for gene

The TRA gene encodes the T-cell receptor alpha chain, which is a membrane glycoprotein that specifically recognizes antigens and initiates the T-cell-mediated immune response. It is expressed primarily by T-lymphocytes and is essential for immune system function.
