# Gene: GNA11

## Genetic Position
GNA11 is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.3).

## Pathology
GNA11 mutations have been implicated in various diseases, including uveal melanoma and Sturge-Weber syndrome.

## Function
GNA11 encodes a G protein subunit alpha q, which is involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those mediated by G protein-coupled receptors.
