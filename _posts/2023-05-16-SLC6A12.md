# Information about gene SLC6A12

## Genetic Position
The SLC6A12 gene is located on chromosome 15q21.2.

## Pathology
Variations in the SLC6A12 gene have been associated with hypertension in some studies.

## Function
The SLC6A12 gene encodes a member of the solute carrier family 6 protein class. This protein is involved in the reuptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, from the extracellular space into presynaptic terminals, which terminates the action of GABA and clears it from the synaptic cleft.
