## Information on Gene GLE1

### Genetic Position
- GLE1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 at position 9q34.2.

### Pathology and Function
- The GLE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of a cell. It also plays a role in mRNA surveillance and quality control during translation.
- Mutations in the GLE1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including lethal congenital contracture syndrome (LCCS1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and autosomal dominant hypotonia type 5 (HMN5).

### External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 2730

- c.1252C>T (rs758778720)

### Related Disease
- Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (LCCS1)
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
- Autosomal dominant hypotonia type 5 (HMN5)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options vary depending on the associated disease with GLE1 mutations.
- For example, LCCS1 is often fatal before or shortly after birth, and there is no cure. Symptomatic treatment to control symptoms and support the affected infant may be the only option.
- For ALS, treatment options are limited, but drugs such as riluzole and edaravone have been found to slow down disease progression. However, there is no cure for ALS.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information regarding drug response for GLE1 mutations.
