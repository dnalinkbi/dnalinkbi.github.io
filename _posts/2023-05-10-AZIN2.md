# Gene: AZIN2

## Genetic Position 
- Located on chromosome 18 in humans 
- The genomic position: 18q11.2

## Pathology 
- No known pathology has been associated with this gene.

## Function 
- AZIN2 encodes an enzyme called antizyme inhibitor 2 that binds and inhibits antizyme, which is responsible for the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). ODC is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines, which play important roles in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
