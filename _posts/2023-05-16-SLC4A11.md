# Gene Information: SLC4A11 

## Genetic Position 
* Chromosome 20: 50,270,693 - 50,341,202 bp 
* Orientation: minus strand 

## Pathology 
SLC4A11 is associated with several diseases including corneal endothelial dystrophy, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, Harboyan syndrome, and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. 

## Function 
SLC4A11 encodes a protein called sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporter. This transporter plays a crucial role in the regulation of bicarbonate concentrations and maintaining pH in various tissues including the cornea, inner ear, and brain.

## Related Disease 
SLC4A11 mutations are associated with several diseases including corneal dystrophies, glaucoma, and Harboyan syndrome. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for SLC4A11-related diseases. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and may include corneal transplantation or medication to lower intraocular pressure in the case of glaucoma.

## Drug Response 
There is limited information available on drug response in individuals with SLC4A11 mutations.
