## Information about gene HEY2

### Gene Position
- The HEY2 gene is located on chromosome 6 at position 6q21.

### Pathology
- Mutations in the HEY2 gene have been associated with congenital heart disease, such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD).

### Function for gene
- HEY2 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular development and morphogenesis.
- It is involved in the regulation of cardiac development, cardiomyocyte differentiation, and apoptosis.

### Related disease
- Congenital heart disease, such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD).

### Treatment and prognosis
- There is no cure for congenital heart disease, but treatments such as surgery, catheter procedures, and medications can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the defect and the individual's overall health.

### Drug response
- There are currently no known drug therapies specifically targeting HEY2 mutations.
