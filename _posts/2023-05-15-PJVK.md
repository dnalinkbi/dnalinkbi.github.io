# Gene: PJVK

## Genetic Position
PJVK is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q37.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PJVK gene are associated with DFNB59 - a genetic disorder that is characterized by hearing loss.

## Function
PJVK encodes proteins that play a role in the development and maintenance of hair cells. Hair cells are sensory cells in the inner ear that detect sound.
