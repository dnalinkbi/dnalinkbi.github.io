## Gene SPG7

The **SPG7** gene is located on chromosome 16q24.3 and encodes for the protein paraplegin. This protein is involved in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Mutations in **SPG7** have been associated with various neurological disorders that are collectively known as hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs).

### Function for gene
The **SPG7** gene encodes for the protein paraplegin, which is a mitochondrial protease that is involved in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics, membrane fusion/fission, and degradation of mitochondrial proteins.

### Related disease
Mutations in the **SPG7** gene have been associated with various neurological disorders that are collectively known as hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs). These diseases are characterized by progressive stiffness and weakness of the leg muscles, leading to difficulty in walking.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for HSPs. Treatment is usually symptomatic and involves physical therapy, medications to relieve muscle stiffness, and mobility aids. Prognosis varies depending on the type of HSP and the severity of symptoms.

### Drug response
No information available.
