# Gene: P2RX1

## Information

* **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17q23.3
* **Pathology:** P2RX1 is a gene that encodes a purinergic receptor which belongs to the P2X family of ligand-gated ion channels. P2RX1 is involved in a wide range of physiological functions such as platelet aggregation, hair cell transduction, and vasoconstriction.
* **Function:** The P2X receptors are activated by ATP and are involved in various signaling pathways including pain perception, taste sensation, and immune responses.
