## Gene Information

**Gene:** RNF139 <br>
**Aliases:** TRC8, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF139, RING finger protein 139 <br>
**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 8: 32,159,189-32,181,006 <br>
**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 20451
- NCBI Entrez: 79664
- Ensembl: ENSG00000177954
- OMIM: 608227
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96EP0

## Function

The RNF139 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation. It plays an important role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is responsible for the clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER.

## mutations

- AA mutation list: c.1311C>T(p.Arg437Ter) <br>
- Mutation type: nonsense <br>
- dbSNP ID: rs764922182

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

None reported

## Related Diseases

Mutations in RNF139 have been linked to the development of several types of cancer, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Due to the limited knowledge of the gene and its association with cancer, there is no specific treatment or prognosis related to RNF139 mutations.

## Drug Response

Currently, there is no information on drug response related to RNF139 mutations.
