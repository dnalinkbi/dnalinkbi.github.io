# Gene ABCA2 

## Genetic Position
The ABCA2 gene is located on chromosome 9 at the position 9q34.3. 

## Pathology
Mutations in the ABCA2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), autism, and schizophrenia.

## Function
The ABCA2 gene encodes a protein involved in the transport of lipids across cell membranes, specifically phospholipids and cholesterol.
