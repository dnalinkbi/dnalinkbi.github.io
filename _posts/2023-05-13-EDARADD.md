# Gene EDARADD

## Information
EDARADD is a gene located on chromosome 1q42.2 and its aliases include EDAR-associated death domain protein and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 27-associated factor 3. EDARADD is involved in the development and morphogenesis of ectodermal structures including hair, teeth, and eccrine sweat glands.
