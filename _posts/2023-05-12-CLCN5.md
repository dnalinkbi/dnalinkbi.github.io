# Information about Gene CLCN5

## Genetic Position

The gene CLCN5 is located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.23 and it spans approximately 33 kb.

## Pathology and Function

The CLCN5 gene encodes for the ClC-5 protein, which is a member of the ClC family of chloride ion channels and transporters. The ClC-5 protein is primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubules and is crucial for proper endocytosis and trafficking of filtered proteins and lipids in the kidneys. Mutations in the CLCN5 gene can lead to Dent's disease, a rare X-linked genetic disorder that is characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal failure.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID

There are several reported amino acid (AA) mutations in the CLCN5 gene associated with different types of Dent's disease. The following is a list of some mutations along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|---|---|---|
| p.Glu211Lys | Missense | rs121912656 |
| p.Arg307Ter | Nonsense | rs104894391 |
| p.Cys447Phe | Missense | rs104894392 |
| p.Arg469Gln | Missense | rs104894393 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the CLCN5 gene.

## Related Disease

Dent's disease is the primary disease associated with mutations in the CLCN5 gene. It is a rare X-linked genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, causing low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal failure.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for Dent's disease. Treatment options focus on managing the symptoms, such as controlling proteinuria and hypercalciuria. In most cases, the disease progresses slowly, and patients can live into adulthood.

## Drug Response

There is limited research on drug response for Dent's disease. Some studies have suggested that thiazide diuretics may be useful in controlling hypercalciuria, but more research is needed.
