## Gene Information

**Gene:** MEF2A

**Function:** The MEF2A gene encodes a member of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 family of transcription factors. This protein plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes.

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 15: 77,301,874-77,465,230

**Aliases:** CSA5, MADS-MEF2, RSRFC4, CMIIB

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 6997
- NCBI Entrez: 4205
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125826
- OMIM: 601074
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q02078

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg29Cys - rs121908001
- p.Arg29His - rs121908000
- p.Arg203Gln - rs121907999
- p.Arg387Gln - rs121907998
- p.Arg387His - rs137854313

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.578G>A - rs121908002
- c.127_128insG - rs372985799
- c.127_128delAG - rs121908005

**Related Disease:** MEF2A mutations have been associated with familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (FTAAD).

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment may involve surgical intervention for aortic aneurysms and dissections. The prognosis for individuals with MEF2A mutations depends on the severity of their aortic disease.

**Drug Response:** There is no current knowledge on drug response in individuals with MEF2A mutations.
