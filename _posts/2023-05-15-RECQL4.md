# Information about gene RECQL4

## Gene Position
RECQL4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24.3)

## Pathology and Function
RECQL4 is involved in DNA replication, repair, and genome stability maintenance. Mutations in RECQL4 are known to cause different types of syndromes, characterized by growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, premature aging, and an increased risk of cancer. One of the known syndromes caused by RECQL4 mutations is the Rothmund–Thomson syndrome, which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin rash, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels associated with RECQL4:
- c.2617C>T (dbSNP ID: rs200919191)
- c.2258G>C (dbSNP ID: rs267607658)
- c.1448A>G (dbSNP ID: rs267607655)

## Related Diseases
Mutations in RECQL4 have been associated with the following syndromes:
- Rothmund–Thomson syndrome
- Baller–Gerold syndrome
- RAPADILINO syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for syndromes caused by RECQL4 mutations. Treatment options are mostly supportive and depend on the specific symptoms and complications of each syndrome. Individuals with these syndromes may have a decreased life expectancy due to an increased risk of cancer and other health problems.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available regarding drug response and RECQL4 mutations.
