### Information about gene FLNB

#### Genetic position
The FLNB gene, also known as Filamin B, is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q27.1) in humans.

#### Pathology
Mutations in the FLNB gene are associated with several rare genetic disorders, collectively known as filaminopathies. These include:
- Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCT), which affects bone development
- Larsen syndrome, a connective tissue disorder
- Atelosteogenesis types I and III, which affect bone and skeletal development
- Frontometaphyseal dysplasia, which affects bone and facial development
- Melnick-Needles syndrome, which affects bone and cartilage development

#### Function
The FLNB gene encodes the protein filamin B, which is an actin-binding protein that helps to organize the cytoskeleton of cells. It plays a role in cell motility, adhesion, and signaling, and is important for the development and maintenance of many tissues and organs.

#### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several hundred mutations in the FLNB gene have been reported in patients with filaminopathies. These include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, among others. Some examples of FLNB mutations with dbSNP IDs are listed below:

| Mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| p.Arg262Gln | Missense | rs121908393 |
| p.Gly2217Arg | Missense | rs757511155 |
| p.Arg2706Cys | Missense | rs376464938 |
| p.Leu1982fs | Frameshift | rs1566847066 |
| c.548-1G>A | Splice site | rs398123460 |

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in the FLNB gene have not been extensively studied, and there are no known SNVs or InDels reported in the COSMIC or TCGA databases.

#### Related disease
The filaminopathies associated with FLNB mutations are rare genetic disorders that affect bone and connective tissue development. The severity and specific symptoms of each disorder can vary widely, but many involve skeletal abnormalities, joint dislocations, and other musculoskeletal problems. Some forms of filaminopathy can also affect other organ systems, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.

#### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for filaminopathies, and treatment is typically supportive and focused on managing the symptoms of the specific disorder. This may include physical therapy, orthopedic interventions, and other measures to improve mobility and reduce pain. The prognosis for individuals with filaminopathies varies depending on the severity of the disorder and the specific symptoms that are present.

#### Drug response
There is currently no known drug therapy specifically targeting filaminopathies, but some treatments used for related disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta may also be useful for filaminopathy patients.
