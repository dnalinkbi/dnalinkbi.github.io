# Information about gene PCNT

## Genetic position
* PCNT gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 at position 21q22.3.

## Pathology
* Mutations in PCNT gene have been associated with a variety of genetic disorders such as microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II), Seckel syndrome, and Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II or MOPD2), which are all characterized by severe growth retardation, microcephaly and skeletal abnormalities.

## Function
* PCNT gene encodes for pericentrin, a protein that plays a major role in proper spindle formation and maintenance during cell division.

## External IDs
* Gene ID: 5116
* Genomic location: chr21:43,553,773-43,574,414
* Aliases: CP242, KIAA0312
