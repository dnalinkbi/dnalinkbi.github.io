# Information about gene GRXCR2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** GRXCR2 is located on Chromosome 5q32.1.
- **Pathology:** Variants in GRXCR2 have been associated with non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive, type 15 (DFNB15).
- **Function:** GRXCR2 encodes a protein called glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 2, which is involved in the maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. Mutations in this gene can lead to hearing loss.

## Gene Information
- **Function:** Maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: 30126
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 342901
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000185319
    - OMIM ID: 617566
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8IY07
    - Aliases: DFNB15, HEI2, KTSC1, TSC32

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** Several missense mutations have been identified in GRXCR2, including:
    - p.Arg96Cys
    - p.Thr312Met
    - p.His322Tyr
- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations
- **dbSNP ID:** rs72824973 (p.Arg96Cys)

## Somatic Variants
- No somatic variants have been reported for GRXCR2.

## Related Diseases
- Non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive, type 15 (DFNB15)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for DFNB15. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of hearing loss, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the hearing loss.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug response for mutations in GRXCR2.
