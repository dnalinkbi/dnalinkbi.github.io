# Gene TDP1 

## Genetic Position
The TDP1 gene is located on chromosome 14q32.33.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TDP1 gene have been associated with the development of spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, axonal motor and sensory neuropathy, and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes.

## Function
The TDP1 gene encodes for the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) enzyme that plays a critical role in DNA repair mechanisms. Specifically, TDP1 is involved in the repair of single-stranded DNA breaks caused by various DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic drugs.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not applicable as TDP1 mutations are typically germline mutations associated with inherited disorders.

## Related Disease
Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for SCAN1. Treatment of symptoms is typically supportive, involving physical therapy to improve balance and coordination, and medications to manage symptoms such as tremors and muscle stiffness. Prognosis tends to be poor, with individuals typically experiencing a gradual worsening of symptoms over time.

## Drug Response
Various drugs have been investigated for their potential to treat SCAN1, including proteasome inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, but no definitive treatment options have been identified.
