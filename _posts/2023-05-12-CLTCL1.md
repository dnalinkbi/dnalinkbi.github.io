## Information about Gene CLTCL1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 22q11.21

**Function of Gene:** The CLTCL1 (clathrin heavy chain like 1) gene encodes for a protein involved in clathrin-coated vesicles formation, which play a role in the intracellular transport of proteins. It is essential for embryonic development.

**External IDs for Gene:**

- HGNC: 2087
- NCBI Entrez: 8218
- Ensembl: ENSG00000166503
- OMIM: 601665
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q00610

**Aliases:** CHC22, CHC17L, CHC-17-L, CLC

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

- p.Arg163Cys (rs137853282)
- p.Arg163His (rs137853283)
- p.Arg163Ser (rs137853284)
- p.Arg163Trp (rs137853281)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- rs1117047722
- rs1566878655

**Related Diseases:** Mutations in the CLTCL1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including schizophrenia, risk for congenital heart disease, oral clefts, and DiGeorge syndrome.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no specific treatment for CLTCL1-related diseases as it is still being researched.

**Drug Response:** n/a
