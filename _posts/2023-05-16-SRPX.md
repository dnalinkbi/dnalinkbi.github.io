# **Information about Gene SRPX**

## **Genetic Position**
The SRPX gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xq22.1.

## **Pathology**
Some mutations in the SRPX gene have been linked to rolandic epilepsy, a common form of childhood epilepsy that typically affects the face and speech muscles during seizures.

## **Function for Gene**
The SRPX gene encodes a protein that is involved in the formation of dendrites, which are tiny branches on nerve cells that help transmit signals throughout the brain.

## **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases**
- Gene ID: 64384
- Genomic Location: Xq22.1
- Aliases: RP11-374G8.4, SUSAR8

## **External Sites**
- HGNC: 11338
- NCBI Entrez: 64384
- Ensembl: ENSG00000131348
- OMIM: 300642
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6NXG1

## **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**
- p.Arg293Gln: rs104894647
- p.Arg75His: rs267607201
- p.Ser437Phe: rs267607200

## **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the SRPX gene.

## **Related Disease**
- Rolandic epilepsy

## **Treatment and Prognosis**
Antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine and valproic acid are commonly prescribed to treat epilepsy, including rolandic epilepsy. Prognosis is generally good for this form of epilepsy, as most children outgrow the condition by the time they reach their mid-teens.

## **Drug Response**
Carbamazepine and valproic acid are both effective treatments for rolandic epilepsy, with the majority of patients experiencing a reduction in the frequency and severity of seizures.
