## Gene GLRB

- **Function for gene**: The GLRB gene encodes for the glycine receptor beta subunit, which is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel family. Glycine receptors play a crucial role in mediating inhibitory neurotransmitter signaling in the central nervous system. The beta subunit is necessary for proper functioning of the receptor, contributing to its localization at synaptic sites and regulating its sensitivity to glycine.

- **Related disease**: 
    - Hyperekplexia: Autosomal dominant and recessive mutations in the GLRB gene have been identified as causative for hyperekplexia, a rare neurological disorder characterized by exaggerated startle reflex and muscle rigidity. 
    
- **Treatment and prognosis**: 
    - Treatment options for hyperekplexia include benzodiazepines or other medications that enhance inhibitory neurotransmitter signaling in the CNS, physical therapy, and assistive devices for mobility and muscle control. 
    - Prognosis for hyperekplexia is generally favorable with proper management of symptoms.

- **Drug response**: 
    - Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam have been shown to be effective in managing the symptoms of hyperekplexia.
