## Gene ERBB2

- **Function:** The ERBB2 gene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein called HER2, which is involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and division. HER2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, and its activation triggers downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis. Overexpression or amplification of the HER2 protein can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and is associated with certain types of cancers, including breast and gastric cancers.

- **Related Disease:** Amplification and overexpression of ERBB2/HER2 are associated with the development and progression of various types of cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The HER2 protein is a target for cancer therapy, and there are several drugs that target HER2 signaling, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib. These drugs have been shown to be effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer. Prognosis for patients with HER2-positive cancer can be poorer than for those with HER2-negative cancer, but treatment with HER2-targeting drugs can improve outcomes.

- **Drug Response:** Response to HER2-targeting drugs can vary among patients, and there are several factors that can influence drug efficacy, including HER2 expression levels, tumor biology, and patient characteristics. Biomarker testing for HER2 status is important for selecting patients who may benefit from HER2-targeting therapy.
