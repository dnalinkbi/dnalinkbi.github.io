## Information about GNAT1 Gene

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 3
- Location: 3q21.3

### Pathology:
- Related Diseases: GNAT1 gene mutations are associated with autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness (CSNBAD). This is an inherited eye disorder that affects vision in low-light environments. Individuals affected with CSNBAD typically have problems with night vision from early infancy.

### Function:
GNAT1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of transducin, a protein that is involved in the visual transduction process in photoreceptor cells of the retina. It plays a critical role in transmitting light signals from the retina to the brain, which enables us to see.

### External IDs & Aliases:
- HGNC: 4412
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 2778
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171458
- OMIM: 139330
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11488
- Aliases: GNAO, GNAOT, RCV1

### Sequence Information:
- AA Mutation List:
  - p.Ser98Phe
  - p.Trp261Ser
  - p.Asp296His
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP IDs:
  - rs73883691
  - rs80338954
  - rs121907946

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- No known somatic mutations have been reported in GNAT1 gene.

### Related Disease:
- Autosomal Dominant Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNBAD)

### Treatment & Prognosis:
- Currently, there is no known cure for CSNBAD. However, individuals with the condition are usually able to function normally during the day. In low-light environments, adaptive measures such as wearing night vision goggles or avoiding driving at night could be helpful.

### Drug Response:
- There is no known drug therapy for CSNBAD.
