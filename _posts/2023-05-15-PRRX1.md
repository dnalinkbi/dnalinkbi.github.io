# Gene Information: PRRX1

### Pathology
PRRX1 gene, also known as paired related homeobox 1, is located on chromosome 1q24.1 region (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000001.11). PRRX1 plays a major role during embryonic development and is involved in the regulation of mesenchymal cell differentiation. It is also associated with several types of cancers.

### Function
PRRX1 plays a role in the regulation of mesenchymal cell differentiation during development. It is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in cancer cells. PRRX1 helps to maintain cancer stem cells, promotes tumor growth, and enhances metastatic potential.
