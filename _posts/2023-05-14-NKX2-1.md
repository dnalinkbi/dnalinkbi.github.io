# Information about gene NKX2-1

## Genetic Position
The NKX2-1 gene is located on chromosome 14q13.3. It spans 38,355 base pairs (bp) of DNA and is located from base pair 33,754,998 to 33,793,352 on the reverse strand. 

## Pathology
Mutations or alterations in the NKX2-1 gene are associated with several diseases, including:

- Brain-Lung-Thyroid syndrome (BLTS)
- Benign hereditary chorea (BHC)
- Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia syndrome type 1 (AOA1)

## Function
The NKX2-1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in lung and thyroid development. It regulates the expression of several genes involved in lung and thyroid function, such as surfactant proteins, thyroid peroxidase, and thyroglobulin.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No significant somatic SNVs or InDels with dbSNP ID are known for the NKX2-1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the NKX2-1 gene are associated with several diseases. As mentioned earlier, some of these diseases are Brain-Lung-Thyroid syndrome, Benign hereditary chorea, and Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia syndrome type 1.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of patients with NKX2-1-related diseases depend on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms. Management may include medication, supportive care, and surgery depending on the patientâ€™s symptoms and needs.

## Drug Response
Information on drug response with respect to NKX2-1 is not available in the literature.
