## Gene DCX

### Genetic Position
The DCX gene is located on the X chromosome in humans and it spans 91,207 base pairs.

### Pathology
Mutations in the DCX gene have been associated with abnormalities in brain development, including lissencephaly, subcortical band heterotopia, and double cortex syndrome.

### Function
The DCX gene codes for a protein called doublecortin, which plays a critical role in neuronal migration and differentiation in the developing brain.
