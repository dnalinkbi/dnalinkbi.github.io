## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** JAK3 

**Function:** JAK3 (Janus kinase 3) encodes a protein that belongs to the Janus kinase family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. The protein plays a crucial role in cytokine receptor signaling pathways, especially those involving interleukin-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21. JAK3 phosphorylates and activates STAT transcription factors, which then regulate gene expression in immune cells.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 6194
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 3718 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138796 
- OMIM: 600173 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P52333 

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 19p13.1-p13.2

**Aliases:** JAK-3, Janus kinase 3, JTK4, L-JAK, JAKL, IMD31A

## Related Diseases
- Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive, T cell-negative, B cell-negative, NK cell-positive
- Interleukin-2 Receptor Alpha Deficiency
- Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic
- B-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Deficiencies in JAK3 have been linked to several types of severe combined immunodeficiency. The primary treatment for these conditions is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
- JAK3 inhibitors have been developed as a potential treatment for autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. 

## Drug Response
- JAK3 inhibitors such as tofacitinib and ruxolitinib have shown promise in treating autoimmune conditions by inhibiting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. 
- However, JAK3 inhibition can also have adverse effects on the immune system, including an increased risk of infections and malignancies.
