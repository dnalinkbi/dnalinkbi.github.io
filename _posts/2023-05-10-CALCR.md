## Information about gene CALCR

### Genetic Position

- The CALCR gene is located on Chromosome 7 (7p14.3).
- The gene consists of 10 exons.

### Pathology

- Mutations in the CALCR gene have been associated with rare autosomal recessive disorders such as autosomal recessive osteopetrosis type 2 (ARO2) and pycnodysostosis.
- These disorders affect bone development and can lead to osteosclerosis and bone fragility.

### Function

- The CALCR gene encodes the calcitonin receptor protein, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) found on the surface of cells.
- The receptor binds to calcitonin, a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the body.
- Binding of calcitonin to the receptor inhibits bone resorption and stimulates calcium excretion.

### External IDs and Aliases

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- p.R272C (rs61732874): Missense mutation that causes pycnodysostosis.
- p.R568W (rs61732873): Missense mutation that causes autosomal recessive osteopetrosis type 2 (ARO2).
- p.W666X (rs61732872): Nonsense mutation that causes ARO2.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic mutations have been reported in the CALCR gene.

### Related Disease

- Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis type 2 (ARO2)
- Pycnodysostosis

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment for ARO2 and pycnodysostosis is centered on managing symptoms and preventing complications.
- Prognosis for these disorders depends on the severity of the symptoms and the age at which symptoms begin.

### Drug Response

- No drug response data is available for mutations in the CALCR gene.
