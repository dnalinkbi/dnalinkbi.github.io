# Gene: EDN1

## Pathology:

The EDN1 (Endothelin-1) gene is located on chromosome 6 (6p24-p23) and encodes for a potent vasoconstrictor peptide hormone called endothelin-1. Dysregulation of endothelin-1 has been linked to various cardiovascular and renal diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure, and renal failure. 

## Function:

EDN1 plays a key role in regulating blood vessel tone and blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. It also stimulates the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, and contributes to the growth and development of various tissues.

## Related Diseases:

- Hypertension
- Atherosclerosis
- Coronary artery disease
- Pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Renal failure

## Treatment and Prognosis:

- Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan, have been developed as potential therapies for diseases related to EDN1 dysregulation. 
- The prognosis varies depending on the underlying disease and its severity.

## Drug Response:

- Patients with mutations in the EDN1 gene have been shown to respond differently to endothelin receptor antagonists than those without mutations, suggesting a potential role for genetic testing in predicting drug response.
