## Information about gene SIGLEC16

### Genetic position and aliases

- **Gene name:** SIGLEC16
- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 20q13.33
- **Aliases:** CD170, sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 16

### Gene function

SIGLEC16 encodes for a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family. Siglecs are important mediators of the innate immune system and regulate immune cell activation, differentiation, and migration. SIGLEC16 specifically recognizes and binds to sialylated glycans on various pathogens, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses.

### External IDs and sites

- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:30709
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 126328
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000102054
- **OMIM ID:** 609427
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q96LC7

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported in SIGLEC16 with corresponding dbSNP IDs, including:

- R97H (rs45587250)
- R136W (rs200532394)
- R149W (rs137853429)
- R165S (rs7101938)

All of these mutations are missense mutations, which means they result in single amino acid substitutions.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in SIGLEC16 in the dbSNP database.

### Related disease

SIGLEC16 has been associated with various diseases and disorders, including:

- Severe malaria: SIGLEC16 is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria by promoting the adhesion of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells.
- Barrett's esophagus: SIGLEC16 has been identified as a novel biomarker for Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous condition of the esophagus.
- Systemic lupus erythematosus: SIGLEC16 has been shown to be upregulated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

### Treatment and prognosis

There are currently no targeted treatments available for diseases specifically related to SIGLEC16. Prognosis depends on the specific disease or disorder associated with SIGLEC16.

### Drug response

There is currently no information available on drug response related to SIGLEC16.
