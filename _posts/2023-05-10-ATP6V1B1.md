# Information about Gene ATP6V1B1

#### Pathology and Function 

Gene ATP6V1B1 encodes a subunit of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) - a protein complex that pumps protons across cell membranes. This protein complex plays a vital role in various cellular activities, such as acidification of intracellular compartments, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and protein degradation. Mutations in ATP6V1B1 have been associated with several human diseases, including distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), hearing loss, and osteopetrosis.

#### Gene Information 

- **Function of gene**: Encodes a subunit of Vacuolar ATPase (V1) which is responsible for acidification of the vacuoles and transmembrane proton transport.
- **External IDs for the gene and genomic location, Aliases**: ATP6B1, ATP6N1, ATPV1B1, KIAA0255, MGC126883, MGC126884; Chromosome 2, NC_000002.12, 223,694,735-223,774,092 (-)

#### Related Disease

Mutations in ATP6V1B1 have been associated with the following diseases:
- Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA)
- Deafness, autosomal recessive 45
- Osteopetrosis, autosomal recessive 4A
- Renal tubular acidosis, autosomal recessive

#### Treatment and Prognosis

The management of various ATP6V1B1-related disorders may vary based on the clinical manifestations and severity of the disease. The treatment may require a combination of interventions, such as acid supplementation, potassium citrate, cochlear implants, or bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for these disorders depends on the disease's severity and complications.

#### Drug Response

Currently, there is no specific drug therapy for ATP6V1B1-related disorders. However, intervention with potassium citrate and supplements is recommended to manage the pH balance of the blood.
