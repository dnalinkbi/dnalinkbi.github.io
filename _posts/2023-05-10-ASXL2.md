### Gene: ASXL2

#### Function
ASXL2 (additional sex combs-like 2) is a member of the ASXL gene family, which plays a role as a transcription regulator. It has been suggested to function in chromatin remodeling and histone modification. Additionally, ASXL2 has also been found to be associated with DNA repair and pigmentation pathways.

#### Related Disease
ASXL2 mutations have been associated with several diseases, including Bohring-Opitz syndrome and Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome. Additionally, ASXL2 has also been found to be dysregulated in various cancer types, including colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer.

#### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for ASXL2 mutations. As it is associated with various genetic disorders and cancers, treatment options depend on individual cases and underlying diseases.

#### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response specific to ASXL2 mutations. However, drug response studies related to the associated diseases may have implications for patients with ASXL2 mutations.
