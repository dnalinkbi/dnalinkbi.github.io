# Gene: RTTN

## Genetic Position

**Gene ID:** 254225  
**Chromosome:** 18  
**Genomic Location:** chr18:11,400,733-11,535,832  
**Strand:** -
    
## Pathology

**Function:** The RTTN gene encodes a protein called Rotatin, which is essential for ciliogenesis and cilia function in multiciliated cells. It is also involved in microtubule organization in non-ciliated cells.

**External IDs:**   
- HGNC: 34433 
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 57579 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169398 
- OMIM: 608500 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6ZUT3 

**Aliases:** C18orf57, FLJ21558, MGC72080, ROT8, KIAA1787

## Mutations

**AA Mutation List:**   
The RTTN gene has a total of 575 amino acids. Some of the missense mutations reported in the dbSNP database include:
- p.Cys812Arg (rs750480419)
- p.Arg227Gly (rs864321435)
- p.Ala638Thr (rs141447244)
- p.Arg507Cys (rs373609202)
- p.Gln51Pro (rs869025946)

**Mutation Type:** Missense

**dbSNP ID:** rs750480419, rs864321435, rs141447244, rs373609202, rs869025946

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**   
No somatic variants have been reported in the RTTN gene in the COSMIC database.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the RTTN gene are associated with several diseases, including:
- Joubert Syndrome 14 (JBTS14)
- Meckel syndrome type 2 (MKS2)
- Bardet-Biedl syndrome 8 (BBS8)

## Treatment and Prognosis

As of now, there is no specific treatment available for RTTN gene-related diseases. Management of symptoms and complications is the mainstay of treatment. The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the disease. Some JBTS14 and MKS2 cases can be fatal during infancy.

## Drug Response

Information about the drug response is currently not available.
