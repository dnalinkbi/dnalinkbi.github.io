## Gene BCAT2
- Gene Function: The BCAT2 gene encodes for branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids.
- External IDs: HGNC: 1047, NCBI Entrez Gene: 587, Ensembl: ENSG00000143367, OMIM: 112605, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15382
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 19q13.2
- Aliases: BCATM, BCT2, KAT2

### Variation information
#### AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID
- p.A346T (missense variant) rs559902164
- p.K270del (frameshift variant) rs398123903
- p.E162X (nonsense variant) rs398123902

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the BCAT2 gene.

### Related Disease
- Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) has been associated with mutations in the BCAT2 gene.
- Breast cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer have also been studied in relation to BCAT2 expression.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for MSUD typically involves restricting dietary intake of branched-chain amino acids.
- The prognosis for MSUD can vary depending on the severity of the disease and how early it is diagnosed.

### Drug Response
No specific drug responses have been reported in relation to the BCAT2 gene.
