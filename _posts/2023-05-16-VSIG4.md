# Information about gene VSIG4

## Genetic Position 

The human gene VSIG4 (V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 4) is located on chromosome 11p11.2.

## Pathology and Function

VSIG4 is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of T cell-mediated immunity, phagocytosis, and apoptotic cell clearance. The protein encoded by VSIG4 is a macrophage-associated protein that regulates immune responses through its interaction with ligands on T cells and B cells. It modulates T-cell activation and cytokine production and inhibits macrophage-mediated killing of tumor cells.
