## Gene: CABP4

**Function:** The CABP4 gene encodes a calcium-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**
- HGNC: 1381
- NCBI Entrez: 9560
- Ensembl: ENSG00000133110
- OMIM: 114078
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O75929
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q13.2

**Aliases:** CABP4 has several aliases, including CACBP4, CACBP5, and CABP5.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

| Amino Acid Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| R34W | Missense | rs369260895 |
| T116M | Missense | rs201417442 |
| C117R | Missense | rs148263820 |

| T393I | Missense | rs200918803 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the CABP4 gene.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the CABP4 gene have been associated with congenital stationary night blindness type 2A (CSNB2A), a rare inherited eye disorder that affects the retina and impairs night vision.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for CSNB2A, but treatments may include visual aids and low vision services to improve vision function.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no specific drug treatment available for CSNB2A.
