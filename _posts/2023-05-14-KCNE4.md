## Gene: KCNE4

### Function:
The KCNE4 gene encodes a protein that is a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel, which regulates membrane excitability in various tissues, including the heart, pancreas, and brain.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- GeneID: 10272
- Genomic location: Chr 2q36.1
- HGNC ID: 6248
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163312
- OMIM ID: 607223
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O95259
- Aliases: MGC138298, MGC138299, KVLTQ4

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- c.172G>A (p.Gly58Ser), rs184527381
- c.232C>T (p.Arg78Trp), rs768980345
- c.74G>A (p.Ser25Asn), rs141275544

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no known somatic mutations for KCNE4.

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the KCNE4 gene have been associated with Short QT Syndrome (SQT), which is a rare genetic disorder that affects cardiac rhythm and increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Management of SQT includes treatment of arrhythmias with medications, implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), and avoidance of triggers that may cause arrhythmia. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of arrhythmia and the presence of other cardiac risk factors.

### Drug Response:
Studies have shown that some potassium channel blockers, such as quinidine and disopyramide, may be effective in treating SQT by prolonging the QT interval and reducing the risk of arrhythmia.
