# Gene: TFPI

- Function: TFPI (Tissue Factor pathway Inhibitor) inhibits blood clotting by inhibiting the Factor Xa and Factor VIIa/tissue factor proteases. It is a Kunitz-type protein and mainly produced by the liver, endothelial cells, and platelets.

- Related Disease: TFPI deficiency is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

- Treatment and Prognosis: The treatment for TFPI deficiency mainly includes anticoagulant therapy, such as heparin and warfarin. The prognosis is generally good with proper treatment.

- Drug response: TFPI has been shown to play a role in the response to heparin, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs.
