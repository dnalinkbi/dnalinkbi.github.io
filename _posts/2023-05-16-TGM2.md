# Information about gene TGM2

## Genetic Position 
- TGM2 gene is located on the human chromosome 20p12.3 

## Pathology
- TGM2 gene is associated with several disease conditions, including: 
  - Celiac Disease 
  - Huntington's Disease 
  - Alzheimer's Disease 
  - Cancer 
- TGM2 mutations are identified as a risk factor for celiac disease by disrupting intestinal integrity, and they also contribute to numerous pathways implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.
 
## Function for gene
- TGM2 encodes for an enzyme called Transglutaminase 2 (TG2)
- TG2 is expressed in various tissues, and it has multiple functions in both physiological and pathological processes, including: 
  - Blood clotting 
  - Wound healing 
  - Apoptosis 
  - Cell differentiation 
  - Cellular adhesion 
  - Extracellular matrix stabilization 
  - Inflammatory response 
  - Protein modification via cross-linking and acetylation.

- OMIM:190196 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P21980 
- Aliases: G-alpha-h, TG(C), TG2, TGase II 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- Several missense and nonsense mutations have been identified in TGM2 gene, including: 
  - R580W (rs3745107) 
  - V329L (rs2290890) 
  - R469W (rs104894899) 
  - W241X (rs121908438) 
  - G273C (rs1049793) 
  - D224Y (rs121908436) 
  - Y516S (rs1055208) 
- Mutation types include: 
  - missense 
  - nonsense 
  - frameshift 
  - splicing 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified in TGM2 gene across various cancer types. 
- Examples include: 
  - p.E646K (rs147385594) 
  - p.E675K (rs148558814) 
  - p.T631M (rs138890838) 

## Related disease
- TGM2 gene is associated with various diseases, including: 
  - celiac disease 
  - Huntington's disease 
  - Alzheimer's disease 
  - cancer 

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment options for patients with TGM2-related diseases vary depending on the condition. 
- For celiac disease, the mainstay of treatment is a gluten-free diet.
- For neurodegenerative disorders, there is no cure, and treatments mainly aim to alleviate the symptoms and slow the disease progression. 
- For cancer, treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination of these.

## Drug response
- There is limited information on drug response specific to TGM2 mutations; however, some studies suggest that TG2 inhibition may be a potential avenue for treating various diseases, including cancer.
