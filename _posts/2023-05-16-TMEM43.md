## Information about gene TMEM43

### Genetic Position
The gene TMEM43 is located on chromosome 3, specifically at position 3p25.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in this gene have been associated with several cardiac diseases, including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 (ARVC5) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC).

### Function
The TMEM43 gene encodes a protein called LUMA (also known as TMEM43 or transmembrane protein 43) that is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. Specifically, LUMA is thought to help anchor the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton and to regulate the turnover of nuclear membrane proteins.

### Related Disease
- Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Type 5 (ARVC5)
- Left Ventricular Noncompaction (LVNC)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Current treatment options for individuals with ARVC5 or LVNC include medications to control arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and heart transplantation. The prognosis for individuals with these conditions varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and specific genetic mutations.

### Drug Response
There is currently limited information about drug response for individuals with TMEM43-related cardiac diseases.
