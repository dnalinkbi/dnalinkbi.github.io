# Information about gene SYNGR1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 22q13.33

**Pathology:** SYNGR1 gene mutations have been associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as with intellectual disability.

**Function for gene:** Synaptogyrin-1 is a membrane protein found in synaptic vesicles in neurons and is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

- HGNC: 11553
- NCBI Entrez: 8805
- Ensembl: ENSG00000128274
- OMIM: 604582
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55773

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Gly119Arg (missense) rs121908167
- p.Ile62Thr (missense) rs587777775
- p.Arg38Trp (missense) rs121908168

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for this gene.

**Related disease:** Intellectual disability, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options and prognosis may vary depending on the specific disorder and the individual case.

**Drug response:** Drug response may also vary depending on the specific disorder and the individual case.
