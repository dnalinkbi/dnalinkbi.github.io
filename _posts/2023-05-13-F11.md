# Gene F11

## Genetic Position:

- Chromosome: 4
- Location: 4q35.2

## Pathology:

The gene F11 encodes for the coagulation factor XI, which is responsible for the amplification of the coagulation cascade. Mutations in this gene can lead to a deficiency of the factor XI, which may result in prolonged bleeding and a predisposition to hemorrhage.

## Function:

The coagulation factor XI, synthesized in the liver, is a plasma glycoprotein that circulates in the blood, plays a crucial role in the initiation and amplification of the coagulation pathway, and later stabilizes the fibrin clot. The factor XI interacts with several other coagulation factors including platelets, collagen, and other proteins to form clots.

## Related disease:

Factor XI deficiency, which is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F11 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis:

Treatment of bleeding episodes for persons with factor XI deficiency typically involves the administration of fresh-frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant activated coagulation factor VII.

## Drug response:

There is no information on drug response related to this gene.
