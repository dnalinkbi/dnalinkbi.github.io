# Information about gene AZF1
## Genetic position:
- Chromosome: 19
- Location: 19p13.3

## Pathology:
AZF1 (Azoospermia Factor 1) is a gene associated with male infertility. Deletions or mutations of AZF1 gene are linked to azoospermia or oligozoospermia.

## Function:
The AZF1 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in the testis. It plays an important role in spermatogenesis by regulating gene expression and meiosis.

## External IDs:
- HGNC: 1146
- NCBI Entrez: 58508
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104888
- OMIM: 603912
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51550

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several missense mutations reported in the AZF1 gene, including:
- c.1102C>T (p.Ser368Leu) rs55766647
- c.1196C>G (p.Pro399Ala) rs730880126
- c.1856G>A (p.Gly619Arg) rs868365693

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no reported somatic mutations in the AZF1 gene.

## Related disease:
AZF1 gene mutations or deletions are associated with male infertility, including azoospermia and oligozoospermia.

## Treatment and prognosis:
There is no definitive treatment for infertility caused by AZF1 gene mutations or deletions. However, assisted reproductive techniques, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), can be used to increase the chance of successful conception.

## Drug response:
There is no known drug that specifically targets AZF1 gene mutations or deletions.
