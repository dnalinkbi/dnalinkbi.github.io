# Gene ECE2
## Overview
ECE2 (Endothelin-converting enzyme 2) is a gene situated on the chromosome 3 and it encodes a protein that is mainly involved in the conversion of vasoactive peptides. This gene is expressed in various tissues, such as the heart, lungs, thyroid, brain, among others. In this article, we will discuss the genetic position, pathology, function, and other details of the ECE2 gene.

## Function for gene
The protein encoded by ECE2 is known for its ability to convert big endothelins(ETs) to vasoactive ETs. It has been observed that ECE2 is also involved in neuropeptide processing, affecting the modulation of various physiological processes like pain perception and satiety.
