# Information about Gene IGHG2

## Genetic Position and Aliases

- The gene IGHG2 (Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 2) is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q32.33).
- Other aliases for this gene include IGHC2, IGHG2B, and IGHG2C.

## Function

- The IGHG2 gene encodes the gamma 2 heavy chain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.
- IgG antibodies are a type of antibody that play a major role in the immune system's response to infections and other foreign substances.
- Specifically, the gamma 2 heavy chain is involved in complement fixation, which is part of the body's defense against bacterial infections.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- There are several known non-synonymous mutations (missense mutations) in the IGHG2 gene, including:
    - p.Asp268Asn (rs121908762)
    - p.His268Leu (rs121908763)
    - p.Ala327Thr (rs121908764)
- These mutations are relatively rare and have been associated with various diseases and conditions.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are several somatic mutations (single nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions) in the IGHG2 gene that have been identified in various cancers, including:
    - c.191C>A (rs143577077)
    - c.196G>A (rs143577078)
- These mutations have been associated with increased risk of cancer, but further research is needed to fully understand their role in disease.

## Related Diseases

- Mutations in the IGHG2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions, including:
    - Immunodeficiency 18
    - Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
- However, the specific role of IGHG2 mutations in these diseases is not fully understood.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with mutations in the IGHG2 gene depend on the specific disease and its severity.
- For immunodeficiency 18, treatment may involve immunoglobulin replacement therapy to boost the body's immune response.
- For autoimmune diseases, treatment may involve medications to suppress the immune system and/or manage symptoms.

## Drug Response

- There is currently limited information on how mutations in the IGHG2 gene may affect drug response.
