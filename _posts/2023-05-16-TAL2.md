# Gene information for TAL2

## Genetic position
TAL2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q31.3) at the position 123, 698, 083-123, 732, 398.

## Pathology
TAL2 gene is associated with several types of leukemia, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.

## Function 
TAL2 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor which plays a crucial role in the development of hematopoietic cell lineages.
