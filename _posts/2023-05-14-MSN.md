## Gene: MSN

- **Genetic Position:** MSN is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p.21.2).
- **Pathology:** MSN is associated with various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, cancer, and nephrotic syndrome.
- **Function:** MSN encodes for moesin, a protein that plays a role in cell structure and function, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction.
- **External IDs:**
  - Gene ID: 4478
  - HGNC ID: 7296
  - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000163914
  - OMIM ID: 309845
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P26038
  - Aliases: CVIL, HEL-S-71n
