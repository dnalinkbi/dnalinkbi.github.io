# Gene OMG

## Genetic Position
The OMG gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11, specifically on the band 11q14.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the OMG gene have been associated with various neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy.

## Function
The OMG gene encodes for oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, a protein found in the central nervous system that is involved in the development and maintenance of the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, allowing for fast signal transmission.
