# Gene CAT

## Information

The CAT gene, also known as Catalase, is located on chromosome 11p13 and codes for the enzyme catalase. Catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It is found in many tissues of the body, including the liver, red blood cells, and the cells lining the lungs.

## Function

The primary function of the CAT gene is to produce the catalase enzyme, which plays an important role in protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species.

## Mutation

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

The following mutations have been identified in the CAT gene:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|---|---|---|
| R22W | Missense | rs17883901 |
| -262C>T | Promoter | rs1001179 |
| c32-13T>A | Splice site | rs769217 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have also been reported in the CAT gene:

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|---|---|
| Missense | rs17883901 |
| Nonsense | rs80320197 |
| Frameshift insertion | rs397514934 |

## Related Disease

The CAT gene has been associated with several diseases related to oxidative stress, including:

- Diabetes
- Cardiovascular disease
- Alzheimer's disease
- Parkinson's disease
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in the CAT gene. However, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reduce oxidative stress in the body. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in the CAT gene varies depending on the severity of the associated disease.

## Drug Response

Some studies have suggested that antioxidant therapy, such as treatment with vitamin E or N-acetylcysteine, may be beneficial for individuals with mutations in the CAT gene. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment regimen and drug response.
