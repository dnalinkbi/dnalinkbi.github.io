### Gene BFSP2

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 3 (NC_000003.12): 7,504,935 - 7,532,347 

**Aliases:** CP49, CTRCT5

**Function for gene:** BFSP2 encodes for beaded filament structural protein 2, a structural component of the eye's lens. It maintains the lens' transparency by stabilizing lens fiber cells.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 986
- NCBI Entrez: 623
- Ensembl: ENSG00000114591
- OMIM: 603212
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60290

**Related Disease:** Congenital cataracts with microcornea and slight microphthalmia 

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Patients with this condition may require surgery to remove cataracts and improve vision. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the cataracts and any related complications.

**Drug Response:** Not applicable as there is currently no known drug therapy for congenital cataracts related to mutations in BFSP2.
