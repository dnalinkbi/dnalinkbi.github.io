# Gene XPO1

## Information

- **Function:** The XPO1 gene encodes a protein called Exportin-1, which is responsible for shuttling various proteins and RNAs between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Specifically, it recognizes cargo proteins with a nuclear export signal and transports them through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 12681
    - NCBI Entrez: 7514
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000196367
    - OMIM: 602559
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O14980
- **Aliases:** CRM1, Emb, Exp1, RANBP16
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2q37.1

    - c.2174C>A (missense, rs724501358)
    - c.2184T>A (missense, rs727504293)
- **Related Diseases:** XPO1 mutations have been linked to various cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors such as breast, colon, and lung cancer.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there are no approved treatments specifically targeting XPO1 mutations. However, a number of compounds targeting the nuclear export pathway as a whole are being developed and tested in clinical trials. The prognosis for patients with XPO1-mutant cancers varies by disease type and other individual factors.
- **Drug Response:** Some studies have shown that XPO1 inhibitors, such as the compound selinexor, can lead to cell death in certain types of cancer cells. Selinexor has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and is being investigated for other types of cancer as well.
