## Information about gene EEF1A1
- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 6, 76,977,095-77,000,391 bp
- **Pathology**: EEF1A1 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy.
- **Function for gene**: EEF1A1 encodes for eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, which is responsible for delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome during protein synthesis.
