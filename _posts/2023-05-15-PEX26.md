# Information about gene PEX26 
## Genetic Position 
The gene PEX26 is located on chromosome 22 at the position 22q12.3. It spans a length of about 4.83 kilobases and its orientation on the chromosome is in the forward direction.

## Pathology 
Mutations in the PEX26 gene have been found to cause disorders related to peroxisome biogenesis, which affects the formation and function of peroxisomes. Diseases caused by mutations in this gene include Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy-like disease (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD).

## Function 
The PEX26 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is specifically important for the transport of peroxisomal membrane proteins from the cytoplasm to the peroxisome.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the PEX26 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease 
Mutations in the PEX26 gene have been found to cause disorders related to peroxisome biogenesis. Diseases caused by mutations in this gene include Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy-like disease (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD).

## Treatment and Prognosis 
Currently, there is no cure for diseases caused by mutations in the PEX26 gene. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive, with interventions targeted at managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease, but often involves severe neurological impairment and early death.

## Drug response 
Currently, there is no standard drug treatment for diseases caused by mutations in the PEX26 gene. However, research is ongoing to identify potential drug targets and therapies for these condition.
