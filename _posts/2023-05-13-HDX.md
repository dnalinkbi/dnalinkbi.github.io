# **Information about gene HDX**
## Genetic Position
The HDX gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4, specifically at the position 4p16.3.

## Pathology
The HDX gene can undergo mutations that lead to the development of Huntington's disease. This genetic condition is characterized by the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in cognitive and physical impairments.

## Function
HDX encodes for a protein called huntingtin, which plays a crucial role in the development and function of nerve cells.

## External IDs and Aliases

- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P42858
- Aliases: HD, IT15, huntingtin, and others.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are many different mutations that can occur in the HDX gene, resulting in Huntington's disease. Some of these include:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| :------: | :--: | :------: |
| c.51-52delAA | Deletion | rs397514688 |
| c.1280G>A | Missense | rs104893975 |
| c.1977C>A | Missense | rs397514666 |
| c.2834_2835insC | Insertion | rs397514699 |
| c.2931_2941dup | Duplication | rs397514700 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in the HDX gene have been reported in certain types of cancer, including pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Some examples of somatic mutations include:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| :------: | :--: | :------: |
| c.1428C>T | Missense | rs201767413 |
| c.2504_2506delGAG | Deletion | rs727504715 |
| c.2927G>T | Missense | rs1554127376 |
| c.3199C>T | Missense | rs146958538 |

## Related diseases
The main disease associated with mutations in the HDX gene is Huntington's disease. However, as mentioned earlier, somatic mutations in HDX have also been linked to certain types of cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
At present, there is no cure for Huntington's disease, and treatment is largely focused on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Depending on the severity of symptoms, patients may require a combination of medications, therapy, and supportive care.

## Drug response
There are several drugs that have been shown to provide symptomatic relief in patients with Huntington's disease, including tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and amantadine. However, the response to these medications can vary between individuals.
