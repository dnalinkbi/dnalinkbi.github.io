## Gene: ST6GALNAC1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p34.2

### Pathology
ST6GALNAC1 gene is known to be involved in various types of cancer, including gastric, colorectal, and ovarian cancer.

### Function
The protein encoded by ST6GALNAC1 gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 29 family, which adds sialic acids to the terminal sugar residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This protein adds alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid to O-linked GalNAc residues on mucin-type glycoproteins.
