# Information about gene SLC39A4

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic position:** SLC39A4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 at position 8q24.3.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in SLC39A4 have been associated with a rare disorder called acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is characterized by skin rash, diarrhea, weight loss, and other symptoms.

- **Function:** SLC39A4 encodes a protein called ZIP4, which is a zinc transporter involved in the absorption of dietary zinc from the small intestine and its distribution to various tissues.

## Gene information

- **Function for gene:** Zinc transporter involved in the absorption of dietary zinc from the small intestine and its distribution to various tissues.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Currently, no somatic mutations are reported in SLC39A4.

## Related diseases

- Acrodermatitis enteropathica: It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in SLC39A4. It is characterized by skin rash, diarrhea, alopecia, and recurrent infections. If left untreated, it can be fatal.

## Treatment and prognosis

- Acrodermatitis enteropathica can be treated with high doses of oral zinc supplements, which can reverse the symptoms of the disease.

- If the disease is diagnosed early and treated appropriately, the prognosis is good, and patients can live normal lives.

## Drug response

- Some studies suggest that certain SLC39A4 variants may affect the response to zinc treatment in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica.
