# Information about gene AGBL4

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p36.32

## Pathology
There is limited information about the pathology of AGBL4.

## Function
AGBL4 encodes a protein that belongs to the peptidase M14 family. The protein is a deubiquitinase that cleaves K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which play a role in regulating various cellular processes such as DNA repair, endocytic trafficking, and immune signaling.
