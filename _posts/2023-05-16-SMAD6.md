# Gene SMAD6

## 1. Basic Information
- Function: Gene SMAD6 encodes a protein that belongs to the SMAD family of proteins, which are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways that transmit extracellular signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, thereby regulating a wide range of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SMAD6 is a negative regulator of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, which is essential for bone formation and growth.
