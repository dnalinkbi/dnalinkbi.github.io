# Gene LEPR

## Genetic position

- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p31.3
- Base pairs: 67,569,598 to 67,601,827

## Pathology

LEPR is associated with several pathological conditions including obesity[1], insulin resistance[2], and type 2 diabetes[3].

## Function 

LEPR codes for the Leptin receptor, which is a cytokine receptor expressed in the hypothalamus, brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, and other organs that helps regulate energy metabolism by controlling food intake and energy expenditure[4].

## External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC: 6555
- NCBI Entrez: 3953
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163515
- OMIM: 601007
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P48357
- Aliases: LEPRD, OB-R

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- p.Pro316Ser: missense variant (rs1805082)
- p.Gln223Arg: missense variant (rs1137101)
- p.Lys109Arg: missense variant (rs1045895)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- c.2028G>A: missense variant (rs1137100)
- c.2085T>C: missense variant (rs2228145)
- c.2213T>C: missense variant (rs8179181)

## Related diseases

- Obesity
- Insulin resistance
- Type 2 diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome

## Treatment and prognosis

Several drugs targeting leptin receptor are currently under development for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders[5]. However, further research is needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety.

## Drug response

Studies have shown that LEPR variants are associated with different responses to weight loss interventions, suggesting that personalized interventions based on genetic profile may be more effective[6].
