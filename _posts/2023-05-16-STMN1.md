# **Information About Gene STMN1**

## Gene Location and Aliases
- **Gene Name:** STMN1 (Stathmin 1)
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1 (1p36.11)
- **Aliases:** Oncoprotein18, Protein Pr22, Metablastin, LAP18

## Gene Function
STMN1 is a protein-coding gene that plays a significant role in regulating the dynamics of microtubules, which are crucial for cell division and cell shape maintenance. STMN1 functions as a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that binds and sequesters tubulin heterodimers, the building blocks of microtubules. STMN1's activity is regulated primarily through phosphorylation by several kinases, including cdk1 and p34cdc2.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are many recorded single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STMN1 gene, but only a few have been identified to cause coding changes in the protein's amino acid sequence. Some reported mutations include:
- **rs16859164:** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of serine with glycine at position 15 (S15G).
- **rs1048339:** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of cysteine with serine at position 63 (C63S).
- **rs2231113:** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of alanine with valine at position 88 (A88V).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several reported mutations in the STMN1 gene that are associated with cancer. These include:
- **rs74315300:** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of isoleucine with leucine at position 115 (I115L).
- **rs1048338:** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of serine with phenylalanine at position 16 (S16F).
- **rs41278816:** A missense mutation resulting in the substitution of methionine with threonine at position 145 (M145T).

## Related Diseases
Mutations and overexpression of STMN1 have been associated with a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, and glioblastoma. Furthermore, alterations in STMN1 have also been linked to bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and neurological conditions such as epilepsy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Current research suggests that STMN1 overexpression in cancer is correlated with poorer prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. As such, STMN1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. A number of small molecule inhibitors that target STMN1 have been developed and are currently undergoing preclinical trials.

## Drug Response
Several drugs have been identified as potential inhibitors of STMN1, including aurora kinase inhibitors, microtubule-targeting agents, and inhibitors of the protein's phosphorylation sites.
