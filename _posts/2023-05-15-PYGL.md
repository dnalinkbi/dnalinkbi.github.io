## Gene PYGL

**Genetic Position and Genomic Location**: Gene PYGL (Glycogen phosphorylase L) is located on chromosome 14q21.2, specifically at the genomic coordinates 47,136,400-47,187,142.

**Pathology and Function**: The PYGL gene encodes the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which is responsible for the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. This gene is primarily expressed in the liver and muscles. Mutations in the PYGL gene have been linked to glycogen storage disease type VI (Hers disease), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in the liver and muscles. Symptoms of Hers disease may include muscle weakness, low blood sugar levels, and an enlarged liver.

**Function of the gene**: Glycogen phosphorylase plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by regulating glycogen breakdown in response to changing energy needs. In normal individuals, the activity of glycogen phosphorylase is tightly regulated to maintain glucose levels within a narrow range. However, mutations in the PYGL gene can disrupt this regulatory mechanism and lead to abnormal glycogen accumulation.

**External IDs and Aliases**: The PYGL gene is also known by the following aliases: GP1, PYGGL. The external IDs for this gene are: HGNC:9726, NCBI Entrez:5836, Ensembl:ENSG00000079134, OMIM:232700, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P06737.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: Some of the reported AA mutations in the PYGL gene in Hers disease patients include R50H, R58Q, L86P, R90Q, R96W, G97R, and R498H. These mutations have been reported in the dbSNP database, with some having multiple submissions.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels in the PYGL gene.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in the PYGL gene are associated with glycogen storage disease type VI (Hers disease).

**Treatment and Prognosis**: The treatment for Hers disease involves managing symptoms with a combination of dietary therapy and exercise. Patients are advised to consume frequent meals that are high in carbohydrates and low in fat to maintain their blood glucose levels. Exercise can also help to improve muscle weakness and enhance glycogen breakdown. The prognosis for patients with Hers disease varies depending on the severity of their symptoms but is typically good with appropriate management.

**Drug Response**: Currently, there are no specific drugs available that target the PYGL gene or its protein product.
