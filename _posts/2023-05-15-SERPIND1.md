- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000122641
- **OMIM**: 107300
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P01008

## Variations
- **AA Mutation List**: Several amino acid substitutions have been associated with Antithrombin III deficiency, including R47A, R47C, A114G, T155M, M200I, G420D, and P464H.
- **Mutation Type and dbSNP ID**: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) - rs121909774, rs121909775, rs121909776, rs121909777, rs28699697, rs140852757, rs121909780, rs121909781

## Related Disease
Antithrombin III deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing blood clots, which could lead to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for Antithrombin III deficiency includes anticoagulant therapy. 
- Prognosis varies based on the severity and complications of the disease. 

## Drug Response
- Individuals with Antithrombin III deficiency may require higher doses of anticoagulation medication than individuals without the disease.
- The drug heparin is commonly used to treat and prevent blood clots in individuals with Antithrombin III deficiency.
