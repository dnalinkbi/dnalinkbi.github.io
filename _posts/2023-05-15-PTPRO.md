# Gene Information for PTPRO

## Basic Information
- **Gene Name:** PTPRO
- **Genomic Location (GRCh38):** Chromosome 12q15; base pairs: 68,948,625 - 69,102,826
- **Aliases:** PTP-oc, PTP-SL, hPTPeta
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:9634
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 5801
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000150907
- **OMIM ID:** 600579
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P23470

## Function
PTPRO is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which plays important roles in signal transduction pathways by removing phosphate groups from target proteins. PTPRO is found mainly in the nervous system, where it is involved in the regulation of neuronal growth and differentiation. It has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer.

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry for PTPRO lists 17 missense mutations in the coding sequence of PTPRO in various cancers.
- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations

## Related Disease
PTPRO has been implicated in a number of diseases, including:
- Colorectal Cancer
- Breast Cancer
- Hematologic Neoplasms
- Neuropathic Pain
- Schizophrenia

## Treatment and Prognosis
The potential of PTPRO as a therapeutic target for cancer and other diseases is currently being investigated. Studies have shown that PTPRO silencing promotes tumor cell growth and that inhibiting PTPRO activity may be a useful approach for treating certain types of cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of PTPRO in disease pathogenesis and to develop effective treatments.

## Drug Response
Due to its involvement in cancer pathogenesis, PTPRO is being studied as a potential target for anti-cancer drugs. One study found that the small molecule C21 could inhibit PTPRO activity, resulting in reduced cell viability in breast cancer cells. Further studies are needed to determine the potential effectiveness of PTPRO-targeted drugs.
