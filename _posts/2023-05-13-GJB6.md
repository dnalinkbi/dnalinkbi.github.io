# Gene: GJB6

## Information
- **Pathology:** GJB6 gene mutations have been associated with hearing loss, including autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA3), autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB1A), and Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome (KID syndrome).
- **Function:** The GJB6 gene encodes for the connexin 30 protein, which forms part of a gap junction channel that allows the exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells in various tissues, including the inner ear, skin, and kidney.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for hearing loss associated with GJB6 mutations include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and auditory brainstem implants.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity and nature of the hearing loss.

## Drug response
- No specific drug response information is currently available for GJB6 mutations.
