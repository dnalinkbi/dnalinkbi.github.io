# Gene TRD

## Basic information

- Function: TRD (T cell receptor delta) is a type of T cell receptor protein which is responsible for identifying and binding to specific antigens on the surface of cells.
- External IDs: TRD is also known as TCRD, and its genomic location is on chromosome 14q11.2. 
- Aliases: TCRD, TRG.

## Mutation information

- AA mutation list: There are several mutations reported in TRD, including missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and nonsense mutations.
- Mutation types: Most of the mutations in TRD are germline mutations which are inherited from parents. Some of the mutations are somatic mutations which occur in T cells during the development of T cell leukemia and lymphoma.
- dbSNP IDs: Some of the mutations in TRD are reported in dbSNP database, such as rs397514603, rs397514604, and rs200924838.

## Related disease

- TRD mutations are associated with T cell leukemia and lymphoma, which are types of blood cancer that affect the development and function of T cells.

## Treatment and prognosis

- The treatment options for T cell leukemia and lymphoma include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.
- The prognosis for T cell leukemia and lymphoma depends on several factors, such as the stage of the disease, the age of the patient, and the response to treatment.

## Drug response

- There are several drugs that are used to treat T cell leukemia and lymphoma, such as vincristine, asparaginase, and dexamethasone.
- The response to these drugs may vary from patient to patient depending on several factors, such as the genetic makeup of the cancer cells and the overall health of the patient.
