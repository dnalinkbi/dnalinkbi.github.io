# Information about gene RUNX1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 21: 33,959,536 - 34,139,836

**Pathology:** RUNX1 gene is associated with several hematological malignancies including leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia.

**Function:** RUNX1 encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It regulates the expression of genes involved in hematopoiesis, including those that control the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 10465
- NCBI Entrez: 861
- Ensembl: ENSG00000159216
- OMIM: 151385
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01196

**Aliases:** AML1, CBFA2, PEBP2A2

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

| Variation Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------------|----------|
| SNV            | rs3744713 |
| SNV            | rs11558538 |
| SNV            | rs111087861 |

**Related Disease:** RUNX1 mutations have been associated with several hematological malignancies including familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM), acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options include chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and targeted therapy. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the responsiveness to treatment.

**Drug Response:** There is evidence that patients with RUNX1 mutations may have differential responses to chemotherapy and targeted therapy.
