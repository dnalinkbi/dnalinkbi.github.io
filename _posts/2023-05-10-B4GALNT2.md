# Genetic Information Analysis Report: Gene B4GALNT2

## Gene Information

- **Function:** The B4GALNT2 gene encodes the beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 enzyme, which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipid and mucin-type O-glycans in the Golgi apparatus. 

- **External IDs and Aliases:**

  - **HGNC ID:** 972
  - **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 10567
  - **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000135784
  - **OMIM ID:** 609137
  - **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9UI12
  - **Aliases:** B4GAL-T2, beta4GalNAc-T2, beta4GalNAc transferase 2, beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, GalNAc-T2

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1, 1q42.12

## Pathology and Related Diseases

- The B4GALNT2 gene has been associated with several diseases, including:

  - **Colorectal Cancer (CRC):** Reduced expression of B4GALNT2 has been found to be associated with worse outcomes in patients with CRC. 
  - **Breast Cancer:** B4GALNT2 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer, and its down-regulation is associated with poor prognoses.
  - **Autoimmune Diseases:** Some studies have suggested that variations in B4GALNT2 may be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for diseases related to B4GALNT2 gene are limited. However, studies suggest that targeting B4GALNT2 could be a therapeutic option for some cancers.
- Prognosis for diseases related to B4GALNT2 gene vary based on the specific disease and the molecular mechanisms associated with that specific disease.

## Drug Response

- No drugs targeting B4GALNT2 have been approved for clinical use.
