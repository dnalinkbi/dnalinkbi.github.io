# Information about gene IGHM

## Genetic position
- IGHM is located on chromosome 14q32.33

## Pathology
- Mutations in IGHM can lead to primary immunodeficiency disorders such as agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency

## Function
- IGHM encodes the mu constant region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain
- It is involved in the production of antibodies in B cells

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 5466
- NCBI Entrez: 3507
- Ensembl: ENSG00000211898
- OMIM: 147020
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01871
- Aliases: AGM1, IGHD, IGHE, IGHM1, MU

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.604C>T (p.Arg202Trp) - rs2227664
- c.819T>C (p.Leu273Pro) - rs45571736
- c.1015A>G (p.Thr339Ala) - rs45571737

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic SNVs or InDels in IGHM

## Related disease
- Agammaglobulinemia
- Common variable immunodeficiency

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment for primary immunodeficiencies caused by IGHM mutations typically involves regular infusions of immunoglobulin
- Prognosis depends on the severity of the underlying condition and how early it is detected and treated

## Drug response
- No known drug response for IGHM mutations
