# Gene HTT

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 4 (4p16.3).
- **Pathology:** Mutations in HTT gene cause Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms.
- **Function:** The protein produced by HTT gene, called huntingtin, is involved in multiple cellular processes, including vesicular transport, transcription, and autophagy.

## Related Disease
- Huntington's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure for Huntington's disease, but some treatments can alleviate symptoms or delay the onset of the disease. Antipsychotic drugs or antidepressants can help manage psychiatric symptoms, while drugs such as tetrabenazine can help with motor symptoms.
- The prognosis of Huntington's disease is generally poor, with most people living 10 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- Predictive genetic testing can reveal whether an individual will develop Huntington's disease, allowing them to make informed decisions about family planning and lifestyle choices.
- Research is ongoing to develop disease-modifying therapies that can slow or halt the progression of Huntington's disease.
