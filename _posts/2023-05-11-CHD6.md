# Information about gene CHD6

## Genetic Position
The CHD6 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.12). 

## Pathology
Mutations in the CHD6 gene have been linked to various human diseases, including cancer, developmental disorders, and intellectual disabilities. Studies have suggested that CHD6 may play a role in DNA repair, regulation of gene expression, and chromatin remodeling. 

## Function
CHD6 encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) protein family that functions as a transcriptional repressor. It has been shown to bind to specific DNA sequences and modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in CHD6 have been linked to a wide range of human diseases, including:
- Intellectual disability
- Autism
- Gastric cancer
- Breast cancer
- Leukemia
- Non-small cell lung cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for CHD6-related diseases. Treatment typically involves management of symptoms and supportive care. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the individual's condition.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug therapy for CHD6-related diseases; therefore, drug response is not applicable in this case.
