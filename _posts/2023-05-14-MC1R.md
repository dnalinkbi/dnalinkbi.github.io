# Gene MC1R

## Information

### Gene location, aliases, and IDs

- **Gene Name:** MC1R
- **Aliases:** MSHR, SHEP3, melanocortin 1 receptor
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC ID: 6903
    - NCBI Entrez ID: 4157
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000165995
    - OMIM ID: 155555
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P41594

### Gene function

MC1R gene encodes a protein called melanocortin 1 receptor, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is mainly expressed in melanocytes. It plays a crucial role in pigmentation and UV-induced DNA damage repair process. MC1R protein activates cAMP pathway, which eventually leads to increased production of melanin.

### Related disease

MC1R gene mutations have been associated with an increased risk of melanoma, a type of skin cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis

Early diagnosis and treatment of melanoma can increase the survival rate. Targeted therapies, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy are some of the treatment options available for melanoma.

### Drug response

Studies have shown that melanoma patients with MC1R mutations have a better response to immunotherapy treatment.
