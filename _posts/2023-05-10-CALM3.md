# Gene CALM3

## Overview
CALM3 is a gene that encodes calmodulin 3, a calcium-binding protein that regulates various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, enzyme activity, and gene expression. 

## Function
Calmodulin 3 is a crucial regulator of calcium-dependent signaling pathways. It binds to and activates several protein kinases and enzymes involved in various biological functions including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell division. 

## External IDs and genomic location 
- Gene ID: HGNC:1453
- Genomic location: Chromosome 19p13.2
- Aliases: CAM3, CaM III

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The following are some of the missense mutations reported for CALM3 gene, along with mutation type and corresponding dbSNP ID:
- R77C: Missense mutation, rs137854551
- D95Y: Missense mutation, rs137854552
- D130G: Missense mutation, rs137854549

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some somatic variants reported in CALM3 gene include:
- c.535G>T: Missense variant, rs876654755
- c.668A>G: Synonymous variant, rs535834003
- c.125delC: Frameshift variant, rs778831702

## Related disease
Mutations in CALM3 gene have been associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS), a rare genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical activity and can cause irregular heartbeats. 

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options for LQTS include medications such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, implanted devices such as pacemakers or cardioverter-defibrillators, and lifestyle changes such as avoiding certain medications and strenuous activities. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and prompt treatment initiation. 

## Drug response
Some studies have shown that CALM3 mutations may affect the efficacy of beta-blockers in treating LQTS.
