# Gene RPL5

## Genetic Position
RPL5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q22-q23).

## Pathology
Mutations in the RPL5 gene have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by an inability to produce red blood cells.

## Function
The RPL5 gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is part of the large subunit of the ribosome. Specifically, RPL5 is involved in the binding of transfer RNA (tRNA) to the ribosome during protein synthesis.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations or indels in the RPL5 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA)
- Ribosomopathy

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for DBA typically involves regular blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and/or bone marrow transplantation. Prognosis varies depending on the individual but many people with DBA live normal or near-normal lives with appropriate treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response specific to RPL5 mutations.
