## Information on Gene ISCU

### Genetic Position, Aliases, and External IDs 
The ISCU gene or Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly Enzyme is located on chromosome 12q23.3. Its aliases include NifU-like protein 2, C18orf19, ISCU1, and MDS019. The external sites for the gene ISCU are:
- HGNC: 19832
- NCBI Entrez: 51066
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138650
- OMIM: 611911
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H6J5

### Function of the Gene
The ISCU gene encodes a protein that is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential cofactors for many enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and other metabolic processes. These clusters are important for mitochondrial respiration, DNA repair, and the synthesis of heme. The ISCU protein is also involved in the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis.

### AA Mutation and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The following are the AA mutations for ISCU gene:
- p.Leu104PhefsTer17 (Frameshift mutation) with dbSNP ID rs1554030627
- p.Cys139Arg (Missense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs744450142
- p.Tyr197Cys (Missense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs200444021
- p.Gln155Glu (Missense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs142905913

### Somatic SNVs/INDELs with dbSNP ID
There is no information available on somatic SNVs/INDELs with dbSNP ID for the ISCU gene.

### Related Diseases
Several diseases are associated with mutations in the ISCU gene, including [1]:
- Myopathy with lactic acidosis (MLA)
- Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA2)
- Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome (MMDS)
- Frataxin deficiency

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for diseases caused by mutations in the ISCU gene. Treatment of symptoms includes medical interventions such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
There is no information available on drug response for mutations in the ISCU gene.
