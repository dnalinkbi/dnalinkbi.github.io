## Information about Gene MAN1B1

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- Gene: MAN1B1 (Mannosidase Alpha Class 1B Member 1)
- Location: Chromosome 9q34.3
- Pathology: Defects in MAN1B1 are associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type II (CDG2) and intellectual disability.
- Function: MAN1B1 encodes an alpha-mannosidase protein that cleaves alpha-linked mannose residues from N-linked glycoproteins and its function is essential for the processing of glycoproteins.

There are no Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID reported in the NCBI Database for MAN1B1.

### Related Disease
- Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type II (CDG2): CDG2 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by neurological symptoms including delayed development, intellectual disability, and seizures. MAN1B1 mutations are one of the causative factors for CDG2.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: Treatment for CDG2 is symptomatic and supportive. There is no specific cure for CDG2. Folic acid supplementation can help with seizures.
- Prognosis: The prognosis of CDG2 depends on the severity of the symptoms and the extent of organ involvement.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response for MAN1B1.
