# Gene Information Analysis Report

## Gene GUCA1B

**Genetic Position:** The GUCA1B gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6, specifically at the position 6p21.31.

**Pathology:** There is currently no known pathology directly associated with mutations in the GUCA1B gene.

**Function:** The GUCA1B gene encodes the protein guanylate cyclase activator 1B, which is involved in the regulation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina. This protein modulates the activity of guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP and is thus critically involved in phototransduction.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 4719
- NCBI Entrez: 2979
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135773
- OMIM: 600364
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P22676

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** There are currently no known disease-causing mutations in the GUCA1B gene.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the GUCA1B gene.

**Related Disease:** Although there are no diseases directly associated with mutations in GUCA1B, mutations in other genes involved in phototransduction, such as RPE65 and GUCY2D, can lead to retinal dystrophies such as Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** As there is no known pathology associated with mutations in the GUCA1B gene, there is currently no specific treatment or prognosis related to this gene.

**Drug Response:** There are currently no known drugs that specifically target the GUCA1B gene.
