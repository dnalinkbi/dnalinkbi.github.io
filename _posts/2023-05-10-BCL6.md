# Information about Gene BCL6 

## Basic Information
- Pathology: B Cell CLL/Lymphoma 6
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 3 (3q27.3)
- Aliases: ZBTB27, BCL5, LAZ3, BCL6A, ZNF51

## Function 
The B-cell lymphoma 6 protein (BCL6) is a transcriptional repressor that is essential for germinal center formation and formation of lymphoid tissue.

## External IDs 
- HGNC:1129
- NCBI Entrez: 604
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171760
- OMIM: 603252
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P41182

## Mutation Information
- AA Mutation List: R21G, P28L, S70R, E324K, R479C, etc.
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP IDs: rs117212029, rs72750308, rs774540163, rs778923480, etc.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels 
- dbSNP IDs: rs56238908, rs372985047, rs587634859, rs780885375, etc.

## Related Disease 
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
- Follicular lymphoma
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
- Primary central nervous system lymphoma

## Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment plan for BCL6-dependent tumors usually involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis typically depends on the stage and subtype of the lymphoma.

## Drug Response 
BCL6 inhibitors, such as RI-BPI and 79-6, have shown efficacy in preclinical studies in treating BCL6-positive lymphomas.
