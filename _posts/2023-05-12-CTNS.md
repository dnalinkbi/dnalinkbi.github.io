# Gene Information for CTNS

## Basic Gene Information:

- **Gene Name:** CTNS
- **Symbol:** CTNS

## Function for Gene:

The CTNS gene encodes for a protein called cystinosin that is located in lysosomal membranes. The protein plays a significant role in transporting the amino acid cystine out of lysosomes, a critical function of lysosomal degradation of cellular metabolites.

## External IDs and Genomic Location:

- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:2522
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 1497
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000145113
- **UCSC Genome Browser:** uc002nnm.3
- **Aliases:** CTNS, cystinosin lysosomal cystine transporter

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:

The AA mutation list for the CTNS gene and the mutation types are as follows:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|p.A120T|Missense, Pathogenic|rs121909869|
|p.L130S|Missense, Pathogenic|rs121909873|
|p.G219A|Missense, Pathogenic|rs121909870|
|p.R190Q|Missense, Pathogenic|rs121909871|
|p.L144P|Missense, Pathogenic|rs121909872|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the CTNS gene.

## Related Disease:

Mutations in the CTNS gene lead to a rare recessive pediatric disease called Cystinosis. Cystinosis is characterized by the accumulation of cystine crystals in tissues and organs, causing systemic damage to the body.

## Treatment and Prognosis:

Currently, the most widely accepted treatment for Cystinosis is cysteamine therapy, which can slow or halt some of the disease's symptoms. Unfortunately, the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains the most significant challenge in Cystinosis management.

## Drug Response:

Cysteamine bitartrate is the most prevalent drug used in Cystinosis management. The drug helps reduce lysosomal cystine levels and delays the progression of organ damage.
