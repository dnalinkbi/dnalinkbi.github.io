# Information on Gene HAMP

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- Gene HAMP is located on chromosome 19 in humans.
- Mutations in this gene can lead to hemochromatosis type 2B or juvenile hemochromatosis, which is a genetic disorder that causes individuals to absorb too much iron from their diet.
- The HAMP gene encodes for the hepcidin protein, which regulates iron absorption and distribution in the body. Mutations in this gene can lead to either decreased production or ineffective function of hepcidin.

## Gene Function
- The HAMP gene encodes for the hepcidin protein, which is part of the iron regulatory pathway in the body.
- Hepcidin regulates the quantity of iron that is absorbed from the diet and the amount that is released from stores such as the liver.
- When iron levels are high, hepcidin is produced to reduce absorption and increase storage. Low levels of hepcidin lead to excess iron absorption, which can result in iron overload disorders.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- A list of missense mutations in the HAMP gene and their dbSNP IDs can be found on the NCBI website: [Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs587779932)
- One example of a mutation is missense mutation c.431T>C (p.Cys144Arg) with dbSNP ID rs587779932.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic mutations in the HAMP gene listed in the COSMIC database ([Click](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic):) [Click](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/analysis?ln=HAMP#variants)
- Examples of somatic mutations include missense mutation c.42G>A (p.Asp14Asn) with dbSNP ID COSM2490817 and missense mutation c.204C>G (p.Pro68Arg) with dbSNP ID COSM2547874.

## Related Disease
- Mutations in the HAMP gene are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis type 2B.
- Juvenile hemochromatosis is a rare form of hemochromatosis that is caused by mutations in the HAMP gene.
- Symptoms of hemochromatosis may include fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain, and organ damage due to iron build-up.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for hemochromatosis involves regular phlebotomy (bloodletting), chelation therapy, and dietary changes.
- Prognosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment. Untreated hemochromatosis can lead to severe organ damage or failure.

## Drug Response
- There is some evidence that certain drugs may improve the symptoms of hemochromatosis, but further studies are needed for conclusive evidence.
- Deferoxamine and deferasirox are chelation therapy drugs that may help remove excess iron.
- The effectiveness of drug treatment varies between individuals and depends on the extent of organ damage.
