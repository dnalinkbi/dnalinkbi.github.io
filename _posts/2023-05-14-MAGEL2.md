## Gene: MAGEL2

### Pathology:
Mutations in MAGEL2 gene have been associated with several disorders such as:
- Schaaf-Yang syndrome.
- Prader-Willi syndrome-like phenotype.

### Function:
MAGEL2 protein is known to regulate signal transduction pathways. It has a role in the development and function of the nervous system.
