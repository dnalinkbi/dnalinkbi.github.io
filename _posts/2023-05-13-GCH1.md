# Information about Gene GCH1

## Pathology
The GCH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GTP cyclohydrolase 1. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor required for the activity of several important enzymes including phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase. Mutations in the GCH1 gene can lead to decreased activity of this enzyme and impaired BH4 synthesis, which can affect the normal function of enzymes that depend on BH4.

## Function for Gene
The GCH1 gene encodes the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase 1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the cofactor BH4. BH4 is required for the activity of several important enzymes involved in neurotransmitter and amino acid metabolism such as phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the GCH1 gene have been associated with several diseases including Dopa-Responsive Dystonia (DRD), Segawa Syndrome, and Parkinson's disease. 

## Treatment and prognosis
For DRD or Segawa syndrome patients, a daily dose of levodopa combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) can greatly reduce the symptoms. 

## Drug response
Patients with DRD or Segawa syndrome tend to respond well to levodopa treatment. Parkinson's patients with GCH1 mutations may also have a positive response to levodopa but with varying levels of efficacy.
