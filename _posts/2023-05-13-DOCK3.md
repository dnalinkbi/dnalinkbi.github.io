## Information About Gene DOCK3

### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Location:** DOCK3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 22.1 (3q22.1).
- **Pathology:** DOCK3 has been implicated in various diseases such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.
- **Function:** DOCK3 encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac and Cdc42 GTPases. It activates these GTPases to regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration.
