# Gene information for EDNRB

## Genetic Position
EDNRB gene is located on chromosome 13q22.3.

## Pathology
Variants in the EDNRB gene are known to cause Hirschsprung disease, Waardenburg syndrome type 4A, and vascular diseases.

## Function
EDNRB encodes the endothelin receptor type B which is involved in various physiological processes, including pigment cell development, neural crest cell migration, and vascular tone regulation.

## Related disease
Variants in EDNRB are associated with the following diseases:
- Hirschsprung disease
- Waardenburg syndrome type 4A
- Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome
- Neuroblastoma

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment for EDNRB-associated diseases depends on the specific condition and its severity.  Surgical resection and bowel management are commonly used for Hirschsprung disease. Waardenburg syndrome type 4A patients may require cochlear implants for hearing loss. 

## Drug response
EDNRB is a target for pharmaceutical interventions, and several EDNRB antagonists are approved for clinical use, including bosentan, ambrisentan, and macitentan.
