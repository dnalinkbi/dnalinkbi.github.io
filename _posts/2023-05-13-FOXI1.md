## Information about Gene FOXI1

**Genetic Position:** FOXI1 is located on chromosome 5q34.

**Pathology:** Mutations or dysregulation of FOXI1 have been implicated in various disorders such as Mal de Meleda, renal disease, and otitis media.

**Function:** FOXI1 encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development and tissue differentiation. It is primarily expressed in the kidney, skin, and inner ear.

**External IDs:** 
- Gene ID: 2295
- Genomic Location: NC_000005.10 (82626981..82719852)
- Aliases: FKHL18, FKH1B, HFH3, FKHL13

**Related Disease:** Mutations or dysregulation of FOXI1 have been implicated in various disorders, including renal disease, otitis media, Mal de Meleda, and psoriasis.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis largely depend on the specific disorder caused by FOXI1 dysregulation.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no information available on drug response related to FOXI1.
