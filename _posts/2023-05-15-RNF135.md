# Information about gene RNF135

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- **Genetic position:** RNF135 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 3q21.3.
- **Pathology:** Mutations or alterations in RNF135 have been associated with several diseases including epilepsy and cancer.
- **Function:** RNF135 encodes a protein that has been identified as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. It plays an essential role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and is involved in regulating several cellular processes including protein degradation and apoptosis.
