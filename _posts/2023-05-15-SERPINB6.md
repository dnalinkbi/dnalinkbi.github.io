### Information on Gene SERPINB6

- **Genetic Position:** SERPINB6 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q25.3).

- **Function for gene:** SERPINB6 gene encodes a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. The encoded protein acts as a potent inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases and can also inhibit certain serine proteases. Additionally, SERPINB6 gene plays a role in regulating various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell migration, and inflammation.
