## Gene: NDUFA8

- **Function:** The NDUFA8 gene encodes a subunit of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is an enzyme complex in the mitochondrial membrane that plays a critical role in the respiratory chain and ATP synthesis.

- **External IDs and genomic location:**
    - HGNC: 7696
    - NCBI Entrez: 4698
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000118422
    - OMIM: 602141
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00217
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 19q13.33

- **Aliases:** Complex I-13kDa-A, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 8, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 13.3 kDa-A subunit

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Arg5Cys (rs28934580)
    - p.Ala49Thr (rs28934581)
    - p.Gly56Ala (rs28934582)
    - p.Arg56His (rs200163590)

    - p.Val77Leu (rs150900894)
    - p.Ala89Thr (rs28934584)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No known somatic mutations identified in NDUFA8 gene

- **Related disease:** Mutations in the NDUFA8 gene have been associated with Leigh syndrome, which is a rare inherited neuropathological disorder that affects the central nervous system.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no specific treatment available for Leigh syndrome. Supportive care and symptom management are the primary options available. The prognosis for individuals with this disorder is variable and depends on the severity and progression of symptoms.

- **Drug response:** No information available on drug response specific to NDUFA8 mutations.
