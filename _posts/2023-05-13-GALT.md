# Gene GALT

## Overview

Gene GALT (UDP-galactose-4-epimerase) is located on chromosome 9q13.3. This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, which is an important step in carbohydrate metabolism.

## Function

The GALT gene encodes the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, which is involved in the conversion of galactose into glucose.

## Mutations

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- D33N (rs111033630)
- Q188R (rs104894389)
- K285N (rs104894390)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for GALT.

## Pathology

Mutations in GALT result in a disorder called galactosemia. This is an autosomal recessive disorder where the body is unable to properly metabolize galactose, leading to a buildup of toxic compounds.

## Related disease

Galactosemia is the main disease associated with GALT mutations. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Galactosemia is currently incurable. However, the effects of the disorder can be managed through a strict galactose-free diet. With proper treatment, individuals with galactosemia can lead relatively normal lives. 

## Drug Response

There is currently no drug available to treat galactosemia.
