## Gene: USP1

- **Function:** USP1 encodes for a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the DNA damage response by counterbalancing the activity of several E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of key proteins that control DNA repair processes. 

- **External IDs:** USP1 gene is located on chromosome 1 and its specific genomic position is 1p36.12. Other external IDs are:
    - HGNC: 12554
    - NCBI Entrez: 7398
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000073282
    - OMIM: 603478
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6N7

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** USP1 has been reported in the literature to have several missense mutations that could cause changes in the encoded amino acid sequence. Some of these mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| p.R37Q   | Missense | rs17161015 |
| p.R348Q | Missense | rs1805344 |
| p.Q461H | Missense | rs17503908 | 

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Several somatic mutations have also been reported for USP1, some of which are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| c.971C>T     | SNV | rs3729534 |
| c.935C>A    | SNV | rs104894720 |
| c.534+10_534+11delTT | InDel | rs767933289 |

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the USP1 gene has been implicated in several cancer types, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. Also, USP1 plays a crucial role in preventing excessive DNA damage and aberrant genomic instability, and thus participates in the maintenance of genomic integrity.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** As USP1 is involved in the regulation of DNA damage response, there are several potential implications for its targeting as a therapeutic strategy for cancer. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of inhibiting USP1 activity. 

- **Drug Response:** Some studies have identified compounds that can inhibit USP1 enzymatic activity and potentially used to treat USP1-associated cancers. Two such compounds are ML323 and PR-619.
