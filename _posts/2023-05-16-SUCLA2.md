### Information about Gene SUCLA2

#### Genetic Position
The gene SUCLA2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 at position 14.2.

#### Pathology
Mutations in the SUCLA2 gene have been associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, which is a group of disorders characterized by a reduction of mitochondrial DNA in affected tissues.

#### Function
The SUCLA2 gene encodes a subunit of an enzyme called succinate-CoA ligase, which is involved in the process of ATP production in the mitochondria of cells.
