## Gene F2

### Genetic Position
Gene F2 is located on chromosome 11 at the position q12.2.

### Pathology and Function
Gene F2 encodes for coagulation factor II, also known as thrombin. Thrombin plays an important role in the coagulation cascade, converting fibrinogen to fibrin and promoting clot formation.

### Related Disease
Mutations in gene F2 have been associated with an increased risk for thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for thrombosis caused by mutations in gene F2 typically involves anticoagulant therapy, such as heparin and warfarin. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in gene F2 varies depending on the severity of the thrombotic event.

### Drug Response
Individuals with mutations in gene F2 may exhibit altered responses to certain anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin.
