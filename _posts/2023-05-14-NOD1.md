# Information about Gene NOD1

## Genetic Position
Gene NOD1 is located on chromosome 7 in humans. It spans over 32 kilobases (kb) and contains 3 exons. The genomic location is 7p14.3.

## Pathology
NOD1 is associated with the pathogenesis of diverse infectious and autoimmune diseases including Crohn's disease, asthma, and psoriasis. It is involved in the activation of inflammatory and immune responses.

## Function for Gene
NOD1 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family that plays a crucial role in the detection of bacterial peptidoglycans and the regulation of the host immune system. Its main function is to activate NF-κB signaling pathway, which leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation and immune responses.

- c.592G>A with dbSNP ID: rs797043663
- c.776C>A with dbSNP ID:rs797045393
- c.1575_1576insTT with dbSNP ID: rs869025285

## Related Disease
Aberrant NOD1 activity is linked to several diseases, including:
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Asthma
- Psoriasis
- Endometrial cancer

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there are no drugs approved for the direct inhibition of NOD1 activity. However, there are several therapeutic strategies under development that aim to target the downstream inflammatory and immune responses.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that several drugs, including Flavopiridol and Bardoxolone methyl, can downregulate NOD1 activity and activity of its downstream inflammatory pathway.
