## Gene ABCC1
### Pathology
ABCC1, also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular detoxification processes by transporting various substrates, including drugs, out of cells. Mutations in this gene can lead to a decrease in the transport function of the protein, resulting in drug resistance, which can contribute to the development of cancer.
### Function
The ABCC1 gene encodes a transporter protein that pumps various substrates, including anticancer drugs, across the cell membrane, thereby reducing their effectiveness. The protein plays a vital role in the cellular export of drugs that accumulate in cells and are toxic to them. This multidrug resistance transport protein is ubiquitously expressed in various types of normal and tumor tissues.
### External IDs and Genomic location 
ABCC1 is located on chromosome 16 at the position 13.1 and it has various external identifiers. The gene is known by different names, including MRP1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 1, and canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter. Some popular websites that provide information about this gene include:
- HGNC: HGNC:60
- NCBI Entrez: 4363
- Ensembl: ENSG00000132639
- OMIM: 158343
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P33527

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

|Missense Mutation|Thr776Ala|rs17216619|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Various somatic SNVs/InDels can occur in the ABCC1 gene, which can result in various pathophysiological conditions such as drug resistance and related diseases. Some commonly occurring SNVs/InDels along with their dbSNP IDs are mentioned below.

|Variant Type|dbSNP ID|
|:---:|:---:|
|SNV|rs2239774|
|SNV|rs3743527|
|InDel|rs45511401|

### Related diseases
The mutations in the ABCC1 gene have been associated with various diseases such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
### Treatment and Prognosis
The overexpression of ABCC1 is associated with decreased chemosensitivity in various cancers. Therefore, ABCC1 inhibitors might have significant potential in chemosensitizing cells to various anticancer drugs in the treatment of cancer.
### Drug response
Various studies on cell lines and tumor samples have indicated that some drugs, such as vincristine, etoposide, and methotrexate, are substrates of ABCC1. The overexpression of ABCC1 can result in the failure of chemotherapy due to the efflux of drugs from cells. Therefore, ABCC1 inhibitors might play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy by reducing drug resistance.
