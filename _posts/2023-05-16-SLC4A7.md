## Gene SLC4A7
### General Information
SLC4A7 is the symbol for the solute carrier family 4 member 7 gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 25.2 (3q25.2). It encodes for the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 3 (NBCn1), a transmembrane protein that is mainly expressed in the brain, heart, and testes.

### Function
The protein encoded by SLC4A7 plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular pH and pH homeostasis. It mediates the electrogenic cotransport of sodium and bicarbonate ions across plasma membranes, which leads to an increase in intracellular pH. NBCn1 is also involved in the regulation of cell volume, acid-base balance, and transepithelial transport.
