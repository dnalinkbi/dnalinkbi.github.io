## Gene PTGS1
- **Function for gene:** PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) encodes an enzyme that is a key player in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an important mediator of inflammation and pain.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: 9605
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 5742
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000095303
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 9 (9q33.2)
    - Aliases: COX1, PGHS-1, PHS1

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs5272 (p.Ala238Val) - missense mutation
    - rs12712120 (p.Ile434Thr) - missense mutation
    - rs10306195 (p.Thr573Ser) - missense mutation
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.
- **Related disease:** PTGS1 mutations have been associated with aspirin-induced asthma and gastric cancer. Increased expression of PTGS1 has been found in colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) specifically inhibit the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes and thus reduce the production of PGE2. Therefore, NSAIDs may be used to treat pain, inflammation, and fever. However, long-term use of NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney damage. Aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits the COX-1 enzyme, is also used as a preventive measure against heart attacks and strokes.
- **Drug response:** Individuals with specific PTGS1 mutations may have altered responses to NSAIDs and aspirin.
