## Information about Gene UGT1A10

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: q37.1

### Pathology
UGT1A10 gene is associated with drug metabolism and substance detoxification. It functions by conjugating various substrates (e.g., hormones, xenobiotics, and other endogenous or exogenous compounds) to glucuronides, which enhances their elimination from the body.

### Function
The UGT1A10 gene's main function is glucuronidation of various endogenous and exogenous compounds to facilitate their elimination from the body.
