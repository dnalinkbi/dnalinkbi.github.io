# Information about Gene SH3BP2

## Genetic Position

The SH3BP2 gene is located on Chromosome 4 at position 4p16.3.

## Pathology

Mutations in the SH3BP2 gene have been found to be associated with cherubism, a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects the jaw and facial bones.

## Function

The SH3BP2 gene encodes a protein called SH3 domain-binding protein 2. This protein is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving the immune system.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic mutations have been reported for the SH3BP2 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the SH3BP2 gene are associated with cherubism, a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormal bone growth in the jaw and facial regions.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for cherubism, but treatments such as surgery and medications can help manage symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is currently no known targeted drug therapy for cherubism.
