## Gene: MPI

Function: The MPI gene encodes for an enzyme, manose-6-phosphate isomerase, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of D-mannose and D-fructose. It converts mannose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, a key step in glycolysis.

Related Diseases: 
- Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ib (CDG1b)

Treatment and Prognosis:
- As there is no cure for CDG1b, treatment focuses on symptom management. This includes a high protein and low sugar diet, physical and occupational therapy, and medications to manage seizures and infections. 
- The long term prognosis for individuals with CDG1b varies widely depending on the severity of the condition.

Drug Response:
- There is limited information on drug response associated with MPI mutations.
