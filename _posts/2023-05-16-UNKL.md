# Gene Information for UNKL

## Gene Position
UNKL (Unkempt Family Like Zinc Finger) is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 5q11.2.

## Function
The UNKL gene is involved in the regulation of mRNA translation through promoting the formation of mRNP granules, which are localized mRNA storage and processing centers. Additionally, it is thought to be associated with the microtubule network and may play a role in cell division.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 29628
- NCBI Entrez: 27347
- Ensembl: ENSG00000170436
- OMIM: 607207
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H2G1

Aliases: R1H1, dJ357N22.4, FLJ25306, KIAA1176, MRNP34, and RMB14.

## AA Mutation List
No amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for the UNKL gene in humans.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or insertions/deletions (InDels) have been identified for the UNKL gene.

## Related Disease
To date, no specific diseases have been directly associated with mutations or dysregulation of the UNKL gene. However, mutations in UNKL paralogues such as the Unkempt gene (UNK) are implicated in cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
As no disease has been directly linked to UNKL, there currently is no treatment or prognosis information available.

## Drug Response
Drug response information is not available for UNKL.
