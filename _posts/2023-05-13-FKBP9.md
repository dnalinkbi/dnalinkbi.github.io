# Gene FKBP9 

## Genetic Position
The FK506 binding protein 9 (FKBP9) gene is located at 10q21.2 on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 between base pairs  59987112 to 59998823.

## Function for Gene
The FKBP9 gene encodes a member of the FK506-binding protein family, which are involved in protein folding and intracellular signaling pathways. Specifically, FKBP9 has been shown to bind to the type II TGF-beta receptor and modulate TGF-beta signaling in multiple different cell types.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several non-synonymous amino acid mutations in the FKBP9 gene that have been identified, including:
- p.Pro179Leu (rs148679270): missense mutation, linked to Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome
- p.Tyr84Cys (rs756622326): missense mutation, linked to aneurysm, familial thoracic 11 
- p.Ala280Asp (rs45581737): missense mutation, linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations identified in the FKBP9 gene with dbSNP IDs, including:
- rs145644229
- rs372825990
- rs528491257

## Related Disease
Mutations in FKBP9 have been linked to several different diseases, including:
- Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome
- hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
- aneurysm, familial thoracic 11 
- autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa

The role of FKBP9 in these diseases is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for diseases linked to FKBP9 mutations. Treatment for these diseases is generally symptomatic and supportive.

## Drug Response
There is currently no established drug response information for FKBP9 mutations.
