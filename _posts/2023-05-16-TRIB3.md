# Gene TRIB3

## Genetic Position and Genomic Information

- **Gene ID:**  tribbles pseudokinase 3
- **Location:** Chromosome 20 (20q13.3)
- **Aliases:** SKIP3, NIPK, TRB3

## Function

The protein encoded by TRIB3 gene acts as a regulatory protein, which plays a critical role in glucose and lipid homeostasis, insulin signaling, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response through the inhibition of AKT and inhibition of insulin-induced gene expression. It acts as a negative regulator of the insulin-stimulated AKT signaling pathway and regulates the transduction of ER stress signals. It also plays an essential role in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

No amino acid mutations have been reported for the TRIB3 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations have been reported in the TRIB3 gene in different types of cancers, such as lung, breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancer. Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

- rs369541301 (c.524G>A) in breast cancer
- rs145204317 (c.385A>G) in colorectal cancer 
- rs113694786 (c.496T>C) in hepatocellular carcinoma

## Related Disease

Studies have found that TRIB3 is associated with various diseases, including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis

TRIB3 is considered as a potential therapeutic target for diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiac hypertrophy. It has been shown that the downregulation of TRIB3 expression can enhance drug sensitivity in cancer cells. As a prognostic marker, high expression of TRIB3 is associated with poor survival in different types of cancers.

## Drug Response

Several drugs targeting TRIB3 are being tested in pre-clinical or clinical trials, such as the small molecule TRB3 inhibitor (NPA) and metformin. The drug response to these inhibitors is being evaluated in conditions like cancer, diabetes, and cardiac hypertrophy.
