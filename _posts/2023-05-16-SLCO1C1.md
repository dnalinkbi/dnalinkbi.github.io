## Gene: SLCO1C1

### Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 12: 22,135,778-22,203,516
- **Pathology:** SLCO1C1 gene variants have been associated with altered drug response and susceptibility to various disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and bipolar disorder.
- **Function for gene:** This gene encodes a transporter protein that is involved in the uptake of hormones, neurotransmitters, and drugs in the brain.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 29828
    - NCBI Entrez: 83663

    - OMIM: 605556
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6UHJ3
    - Aliases: SLCO1C1, OATP14, SOATP, SOATP1, solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1

### Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.79G>A (p.Val27Ile), rs4149017
    - c.441G>A (p.Ser147Asn), rs2306283
    - c.1274G>A (p.Val425Ile), rs11968503
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

### Related Disease
- SLCO1C1 gene variants have been associated with the following diseases:
    - Alzheimer's disease
    - Multiple sclerosis
    - Bipolar disorder

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Further research is needed to determine the exact role of SLCO1C1 gene variants in disease susceptibility and drug response. As of now, there is no specific treatment or prognosis related to SLCO1C1 gene variants.

### Drug Response
- SLCO1C1 gene variants have been associated with altered drug response in some individuals. For example, the variant rs2306283 has been linked to decreased response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with major depressive disorder.
