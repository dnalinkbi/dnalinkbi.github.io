# Information about gene MACC1

## Genetic Position
The MACC1 gene is located on chromosome 7q21.1 and spans 172 kb.

## Pathology
Research suggests that MACC1 plays a key role in tumor progression, metastasis and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of MACC1 has been found in several cancers such as colorectal, gastric, liver, pancreatic, and ovarian carcinoma, making it a potential therapeutic target.

## Function for gene
The MACC1 gene encodes a transcription regulatory protein that plays an important role in tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis.

Aliases for MACC1 include: Metastasis-Associated in Colon Cancer 1, Protein PRL-3, SH3PXD2B-AS1, and Transcriptional Factor MACC1.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported for the MACC1 gene. The following are a few examples:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |

| T766I       | missense      | rs767107193 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations have been reported for MACC1 in different types of cancers. Here are a few examples:

| SNV/InDel | Mutation Type | Cancer Type | dbSNP ID |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| c.1205G>A | missense     | colorectal | rs727276208 |
| c.1614C>G | nonsynonymous | gastric     | rs878853874 |
| c.1286_1289delTTAG | deletion  | pancreatic | rs1057519949 |

## Related Disease
MACC1 dysregulation has been implicated in several types of cancers including colorectal, gastric, liver, pancreatic and ovarian carcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
MACC1 has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Research has shown that inhibition of MACC1 can suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Several studies have also suggested that high MACC1 expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs directly targeting MACC1, but its potential as a therapeutic target is being explored.
