# Information about gene COX15

**Genetic Position**: COX15 gene is present on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 10q24.2.

**Pathology**: Mutations in the COX15 gene are associated with mitochondrial disorders, specifically those affecting the respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). These disorders are characterized by a wide range of symptoms including muscle weakness, ataxia, neuropathy, and various other neurological and metabolic abnormalities.

**Function**: COX15 gene encodes for a protein involved in mitochondrial biogenesis that is required for the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxidase is a mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complex that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen during ATP synthesis.

- c.680_682delTTC (p.Phe227del) (rs387907290)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: No somatic mutations in COX15 gene have been reported.

**Related disease**: COX15 gene mutations are associated with Infantile-onset multisystem mitochondrial disorder with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency 2 (IMMTCD2), Leigh Syndrome, and other mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders.

**Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment options are supportive and symptom-based. In general, mitochondrial disorders have varying degrees of severity, and their prognosis largely depends on the specific mutation and its impact on mitochondrial function.

**Drug response**: There are no specific drugs or medication approved for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders. However, some dietary supplements (such as Coenzyme Q10) have been shown to have some potential benefits in some patients.
