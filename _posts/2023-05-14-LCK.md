# Gene: LCK (LCK Proto-Oncogene, Src Family Tyrosine Kinase)

## Genetic Position:
The LCK gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 35.1 (1p35-p34).

## Pathology:
Mutations in the LCK gene have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.

## Function for Gene:
The gene encodes the LCK protein, which is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. LCK plays a crucial role in T-cell development and activation by initiating the intracellular signaling pathways required for T-cell receptor signaling.

## Related Disease:
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis

## Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for patients with LCK mutations varies depending on the specific mutation and associated disease. Some autoimmune diseases associated with LCK mutations can be managed with immunosuppressive drugs. However, the prognosis for individuals with severe autoimmune disease can vary.

## Drug Response:
Drug response is not yet fully understood in relation to LCK mutations, but recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of LCK activity can inhibit T-cell-mediated immune responses.
