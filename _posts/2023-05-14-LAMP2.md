## Gene: LAMP2

- Function: LAMP2 is a lysosomal membrane protein that plays a critical role in autophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and lysosomal catabolism of cellular components. It is involved in the degradation of various macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.

- Related disease: Danon disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects the heart, skeletal muscles, and nervous system. It is caused by mutations in LAMP2 gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant fashion.

- Treatment and prognosis: There is currently no cure for Danon disease. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on the management of cardiac and neuromuscular symptoms. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and varies among individuals.

- Drug response: There is no specific drug treatment for Danon disease. However, some medications may be used to manage symptoms, such as beta-blockers for cardiac symptoms.
