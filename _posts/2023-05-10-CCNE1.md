## Gene CCNE1
- **Function for gene:** CCNE1 (Cyclin E1) is a regulatory protein involved in the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. It plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair, especially during mitosis. 
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
  - Gene ID: 898
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 19q12
  - Aliases: Cyclin E1, CCNE, DNC1, FLJ46444

  - c.553G>A - rs200607934
  - c.688G>A - rs796893034
- **Related disease:** CCNE1 abnormalities have been frequently observed in several cancer types, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Patients with CCNE1 amplification have a poor response to chemotherapy and a worse prognosis. Targeted therapies against CCNE1 are currently being developed.
- **Drug response:** Palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, is currently being investigated as a treatment for CCNE1-amplified cancers.
