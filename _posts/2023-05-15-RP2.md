## Gene RP2 Information

### Genomic Location, Aliases and External IDs

- External IDs: HGNC: 10260, NCBI Entrez: 6101, Ensembl: ENSG00000185060, OMIM: 312600, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P38984
- Genomic Location: Chromosome X: 153,350,212-153,355,430 (- strand)
- Aliases: CORDX1, PRA, RP2A, RP2L1

### Function

- The RP2 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in the regulation of the structure and function of the cilium, a cellular organelle that plays a crucial role in the organization of the cell, cell signaling, and sensory perception. Dysfunction of the RP2 protein leads to ciliopathies, conditions characterized by the abnormal structure or function of the cilium.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- p.Arg120His (R120H), missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs104894372
- p.Val220Glu (V220E), missense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs267606752
- p.Gln309Ter (Q309X), nonsense mutation, dbSNP ID: rs104894373
- p.Gln158Profs*34 (Q158fs), frameshift mutation, dbSNP ID: rs104894374

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the RP2 gene.

### Related Disease

- Mutations in the RP2 gene are associated with a variety of conditions, including X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and macular degeneration.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for RP2-related diseases. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of vision loss. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the specific mutation involved.

### Drug Response

- There is currently no known drug response related to RP2 mutations.
