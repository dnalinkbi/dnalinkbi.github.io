## Gene NME7

### Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chr 16:3,171,758-3,176,173
- **Pathology:** No known pathology related to gene NME7.
- **Function:** NME7 (non-metastatic cells 7) is a human nuclear protein that is involved in the maintenance of proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with several other proteins that are known to play key roles in cytokinesis, including the microtubule-binding protein PRC1 and the kinesin motor protein KIF14. NME7 is also thought to be involved in the regulation of mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
