## Information on Gene PDCD10

**Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function:**

- Gene: PDCD10
- Chromosome location: 3q26.1
- Pathology: Mutations in PDCD10 have been associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), which are clusters of abnormally formed blood vessels in the brain or spinal cord that can cause seizures, hemorrhages, and neurological deficits.
- Function: PDCD10 encodes a protein known as Programmed Cell Death 10 (PDCD10), which plays a crucial role in regulating angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. PDCD10 is a scaffold protein that interacts with various signaling molecules to modulate several cellular pathways, including the Hippo and MAPK signaling pathways.

- c.868G>A, p.R290H (rs553332454)

**Related Disease:**
- Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM)

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
- Currently, there is no cure for CCM, and treatment is aimed at managing symptoms, reducing the risk of hemorrhage, and preventing complications. 
- The prognosis of CCM depends on various factors such as the size, location, and number of lesions, as well as the age, overall health, and medical history of the affected individuals.

**Drug Response:**
- There are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for treating CCM, but several drugs that target the various signaling pathways involving PDCD10 are being investigated, such as statins, MAPK inhibitors, and Rho kinase inhibitors.
