## Gene: GLUL

### Function
The GLUL gene encodes the enzyme Glutamate-ammonia ligase, which is also known as Glutamine synthetase. The enzyme plays a crucial role in the detoxification of ammonia and provides primary metabolic support for the central nervous system.

### Related disease
Mutations in the GLUL gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Epilepsy.

### Treatment and prognosis
As of now, there is no treatment available that targets GLUL mutations directly. However, some studies have shown that probenecid, a drug used to treat gout, can increase GLUL expression and may have therapeutic potential for neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Drug response
GLUL modulating drugs such as L-methylfolate showed significant improvement in mood stabilization in patients with bipolar disorder.
