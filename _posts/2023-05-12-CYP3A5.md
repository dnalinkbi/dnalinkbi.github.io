### Gene: CYP3A5

#### Genetic Position
CYP3A5 is located on chromosome 7q22.1.

#### Pathology
Polymorphisms in CYP3A5 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism, resulting in variable drug response and toxicity. Specifically, reduced function of CYP3A5 has been linked to decreased metabolism of drugs such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and carbamazepine, leading to increased exposure to these drugs and potential toxicity. Furthermore, increased CYP3A5 activity has been associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.

#### Function for gene
CYP3A5 encodes for a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes that are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, it is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in this gene.

#### Related Disease
Altered function of CYP3A5 has been linked to an increased risk of developing various diseases, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline. Some studies have also suggested that certain CYP3A5 polymorphisms may be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, but further research is needed to confirm these findings.

#### Treatment and prognosis
Altered function of CYP3A5 can affect the metabolism of many drugs, including tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and carbamazepine. Patients with altered CYP3A5 function may require personalized dosing and monitoring of medication levels to avoid toxicity or treatment failure.

#### Drug response
The function of CYP3A5 can significantly affect drug metabolism, leading to variable drug response and toxicity. Reduced function of CYP3A5 has been linked to increased drug exposure and potential toxicity, while increased CYP3A5 activity can lead to decreased drug exposure and inadequate treatment response.
