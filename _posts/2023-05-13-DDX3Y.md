# **Information about Gene DDX3Y**

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function:

- Gene Name: DDX3Y

- Chromosome: Y

- Location: Yq11.221

- Pathology: DDX3Y mutation or deletion has been linked to the impaired spermatogenesis, impaired meiosis, and infertility. In addition, it has been associated with male-specific diseases such as testicular germ cell tumors and hypospadias.

- Function: DDX3Y belongs to DEAD-box helicase family of proteins and plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism and translation initiation. It is involved in the unwinding of RNA duplexes, RNA export, splicing, and processing.
