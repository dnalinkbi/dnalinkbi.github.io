# Gene: NUTM2B

## Information

- **Function of Gene:** The NUTM2B gene encodes a protein that is associated with chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and cell differentiation.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

   | Gene ID | Genomic Location | Alias |
   |--------|------------------|-------|
   | HGNC:25555 | Chr 12: 78.5 - 78.7 Mb | C6orf211, NUT2, NUTM2 |
   | NCBI Entrez: 80776 | Chr 12: 78.52 Mb | - |
   | Ensembl: ENSG00000135426 | Chr 12: 78.52 Mb | - |
   | OMIM: 614700 | - | NUTM2B-related gene |
   | UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NWT6 | - | NUTM2B_HUMAN |

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

   | AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
   |-------------|---------------|----------|
   | Lys331Glu | Missense | rs199735844 |
   | Arg55Ter | Nonsense | rs778539634 |
   | Ala277Val | Missense | rs150812432 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

   | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
   |---------------|----------|
   | SNVs | rs1064799175 |
   | InDels | rs1057518923 |

- **Related Disease:** NUTM2B has been linked to cancer and specifically, NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) which is a rare and aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Due to the rarity of NUT midline carcinoma, there is currently no established system for treating it. Treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and sometimes surgery. The prognosis for NMC is generally poor, with a median survival of less than 1 year.

- **Drug Response:** There is currently no targeted therapy for NUT midline carcinoma, and treatment is mostly palliative.
