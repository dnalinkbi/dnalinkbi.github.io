## Information about gene SLC22A6

**Genetic position:** The gene SLC22A6 is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q12.1.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the SLC22A6 gene have been associated with various diseases like chronic kidney disease, gout, and type 2 diabetes.

**Function for gene:** SLC22A6 encodes a protein known as organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), which is involved in the transport of various organic ions across the plasma membrane. OAT1 is expressed in the kidney and plays a crucial role in the renal clearance of many drugs and toxins.
