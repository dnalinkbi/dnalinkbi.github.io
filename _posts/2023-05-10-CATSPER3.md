# Information about Gene CATSPER3

## Genetic Position
The gene CATSPER3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q31.1).

## Pathology
CATSPER3 has been implicated in several pathologies including male infertility and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Function for Gene
CATSPER3 encodes for a protein that is part of the CatSper ion channel complex found in sperm cells. The CatSper ion channel complex plays a crucial role in male fertility by regulating the entry of calcium ions into sperm cells, which is necessary for fertilization.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | -------------| -------- |
| E77K        | Missense     | rs556152690 |
| R320*       | Nonsense     | rs267607166 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels identified for CATSPER3 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CATSPER3 have been associated with male infertility, oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, and idiopathic male infertility.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for CATSPER3-related pathologies. However, in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques can be used to overcome male fertility issues associated with CATSPER3 mutations.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response for CATSPER3-related pathologies.
