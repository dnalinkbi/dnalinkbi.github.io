# Gene: DNAJB2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2q35

## Pathology
- None reported for the gene itself.

## Function
- Encodes for a protein called DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B2, which is involved in protein folding, assembly, and degradation. 

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 2938
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 10040
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000144136
- OMIM ID: 608375
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UBS3
- Aliases: HSJ2, HSJBP2, DNAJB2B

## AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID
- p.Asp16Asn (missense variant) rs34554103
- p.Lys60Asn (missense variant) rs121434280
- p.Lys71Asn (missense variant) rs769219614
- p.Asn108Ser (missense variant) rs758018267

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No reported somatic SNVs/InDels

## Related Disease
- Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA): DNAJB2 mutations have been found in patients with SMA. However, the pathogenicity of these mutations is not clear yet.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment and prognosis are not applicable as the function of the gene is not clearly linked to any pathological condition.

## Drug Response
- No information available regarding drug response related to DNAJB2.
