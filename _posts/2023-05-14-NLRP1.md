# Gene Information for NLRP1

## Genetic Position
NLRP1 is located on chromosome 17q11.2 and contains 28 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in NLRP1 have been associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including vitiligo, Addison disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease.

## Function
NLRP1 encodes a protein that is involved in the innate immune system and plays a role in inflammation and apoptosis.
