# Information on Gene SMCHD1

## Gene Position and Aliases
- Gene: SMCHD1 (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes Flexible Hinge Domain Containing 1)
- Chromosome: 18
- Genomic Location: 18q12.2
- Aliases: KIAA1967, SATCHMO, DXS9979E

## Function of Gene
SMCHD1 plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by modification of the chromatin state. It is responsible for the formation of heterochromatin, particularly at imprinted loci and repetitive DNA elements. It also plays a pivotal role in X-chromosome inactivation in mammals.

There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels associated with SMCHD1 in dbSNP. 

## Related Diseases 
SMCHD1 mutations have been linked to several diseases including: 
- Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) 
- Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) 
- Congenital arhinia (CNAR) 
- Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2)

## Treatment and Prognosis 
Currently, there is no cure for SMCHD1 related diseases. The treatment depends on the specific symptoms and complications of the disease. Prognosis is generally poor for most of the diseases associated with SMCHD1. 

## Drug Response
