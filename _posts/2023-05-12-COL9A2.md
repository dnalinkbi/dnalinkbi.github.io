# Gene: COL9A2

## Information
- Pathology: Mutations in this gene cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), a genetic disorder that affects cartilage and bone development.
- Function: The COL9A2 gene provides instruction for the production of collagen type IX alpha 2 chain which is primarily found in the hyaline cartilage, a flexible connective tissue.
