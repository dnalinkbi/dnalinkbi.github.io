**Related Diseases:** 
- Retinoblastoma
- Osteosarcoma
- Bladder cancer
- Lung cancer
- Breast cancer
- Prostate cancer

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
- Retinoblastoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery
- Osteosarcoma is treated with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy
- Prognosis depends on various factors such as age, stage of cancer, and response to treatment

**Drug Response:**
- Studies suggest that RB1 gene status may be a predictive factor for drug response in certain types of cancer such as breast cancer and lung cancer
