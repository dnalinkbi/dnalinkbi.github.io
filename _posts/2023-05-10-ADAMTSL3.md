# Gene: ADAMTSL3

ADAMTSL3 is a gene that encodes for ADAMTS-like protein 3 and is located on chromosome 15q24.2. This gene is known to be associated with various pathologies and functions.

## Function for gene

ADAMTS-like protein 3 is a protease that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers in connective tissues. It is also involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and regulation.

## Related disease

Mutations in the ADAMTSL3 gene are associated with various inherited connective tissue disorders, including geleophysic dysplasia type 2 (OMIM: 614185) and autosomal dominant cutis laxa type IIC (OMIM: 616603).

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for individuals with mutations in the ADAMTSL3 gene vary depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the symptoms. Treatment may involve surgical intervention or medication to manage symptoms.

## Drug response

Currently, there are no drugs or specific therapies available that target mutations in the ADAMTSL3 gene.
