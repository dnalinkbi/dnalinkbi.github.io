# Information on Gene UGT2B7

## Gene Overview:
UGT2B7 gene is located on chromosome 4q13.2 and encodes for UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B7. The gene spans 2,958 base pairs and contains five exons.

## Function:
This gene is involved in the glucuronidation of numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds, including bile acids, steroids, neurotransmitters and drugs.

## Aliases:
- UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7
- UDPGT 2B7
- UDPGT B7
- UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7, inducible

## External IDs:
- HGNC: 12531
- NCBI Entrez: 7363
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138795
- OMIM: 600067
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16662

## AA Mutation list:
The following are some of the reported missense mutations and their dbSNP IDs:
- p.Arg184Ser (rs12233719)
- p.Ala161Thr (rs743817)
- p.Arg268Cys (rs28365062)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:
There are a number of somatic mutations reported for UGT2B7 gene, including:
- c.233G>A (rs13115085)
- c.802G>A (rs1974697)
- c.86C>T (rs4124874)

## Related Diseases:
Variants in UGT2B7 gene have been associated with various clinical phenotypes, including:
- Gilbert's syndrome
- Breast Cancer
- Pancreatic Cancer
- Bladder Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for UGT2B7-associated diseases. However, the prognosis may depend on the specific clinical phenotype manifested by the patient.

## Drug Response:
A number of drugs are known to be substrates of UGT2B7, and individual variability in UGT2B7 activity may have an impact on the efficacy and safety of those drugs.
