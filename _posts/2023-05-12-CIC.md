### Function for Gene
CIC (Capicua Transcriptional Repressor) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences in promoter regions of target genes. It plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer.
