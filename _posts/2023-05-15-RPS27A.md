## **Gene:** RPS27A

### **Position:**
The RPS27A gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p16.2) from base pair 56,564,405 to base pair 56,574,977.

### **Pathology:**
Mutations in the RPS27A gene have been associated with several cancers, including breast, liver, and lung cancer. Overexpression of RPS27A has also been implicated in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

### **Function:**
The RPS27A gene encodes a ribosomal protein that plays a key role in protein translation. Specifically, RPS27A is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit that binds to mRNA and helps initiate protein synthesis.

### **Related diseases:**
The RPS27A gene has been implicated in several cancers, including breast, liver, and lung cancer.

### **Treatment and prognosis:**
More research is needed to determine the exact therapeutic implications of RPS27A mutations in cancer. However, targeting RPS27A may be a potential avenue for cancer therapy.

### **Drug response:**
No drug response information is currently available for RPS27A mutations.
