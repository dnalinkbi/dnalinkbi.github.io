# Information about Gene DOCK4

## Genetic Position
DOCK4 is a gene located on chromosome 7 at the position 7q31.2.

## Pathology
Some studies have suggested that the DOCK4 gene is involved in cancer progression, migration, and invasion. Additionally, rare variants in DOCK4 have been associated with Intellectual disability.

## Function for Gene
DOCK4 gene encodes a protein called dedicator of cytokinesis protein 4. The protein is involved in the regulation of neuronal migration and axon outgrowth. It also plays a role in the actin cytoskeletal organization and is involved in the formation of filopodia.
