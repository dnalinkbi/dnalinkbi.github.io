## Gene: 

Growth Differentiation Factor 7 (GDF7)

## Function:

GDF7 gene encodes a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family and plays a vital role in skeletal development.

- NCBI Entrez Gene: 9241
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116049
- OMIM: 601147
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95390

## Mutation information:

### AA mutation list:

- p.Ala243Val
- p.Ile269Met
- p.Arg287Lys

### Mutation Type:

- Missense mutation

### dbSNP ID:

- rs34256529
- rs34399037
- rs122593364

## Somatic SNVs/InDels:

### dbSNP ID:

- rs561583577

## Related Diseases:

- Multiple Synostoses Syndrome 2 (SYNS2) 
- Brachydactyly Type A2 (BDA2)
- Osteoarthritis 

## Treatment and prognosis:

There is no specific treatment for GDF7-associated diseases, and the prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug response:

No drugs have been approved specifically for GDF7-associated diseases. However, some drugs targeting BMPs have shown potential therapeutic effects.
