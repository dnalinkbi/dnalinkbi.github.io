# Information about gene RNASET2

## Genetic Position
The RNASET2 gene is located on chromosome 6q27.

## Pathology
Mutations in the RNASET2 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, particularly liver cancer and breast cancer.

## Function
The RNASET2 gene encodes an enzyme called Ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) which cleaves single-stranded RNA molecules. RNASET2 has also been shown to play a role in cell differentiation and apoptosis.
