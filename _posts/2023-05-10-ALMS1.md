**Gene:** ALMS1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2q31.1

**Pathology:** Mutations in ALMS1 gene are associated with Alström syndrome which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by obesity, type 2 diabetes, retinal degeneration, hearing impairment, cardiomyopathy, and progressive kidney dysfunction.

**Function for Gene:** The ALMS1 gene encodes a protein called Alström protein which helps in the formation and function of cilia and centrosomes in cells. These structures are required for several cellular processes, including signaling, cell division, and motility.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- No somatic variants reported in the ALMS1 gene

**Related Disease:** Alström syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, retinal degeneration, hearing impairment, cardiomyopathy, and progressive kidney dysfunction.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure or specific treatment for Alström syndrome. The management of symptoms includes treating obesity, diabetes, hearing and vision problems, and cardiovascular disease. Kidney transplantation may be required in some cases. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

**Drug Response:** There is no specific drug available for Alström syndrome. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive.
