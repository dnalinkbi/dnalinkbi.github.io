## Information on Gene ACVR2B

### Genetic Position and Aliases

* Genomic Location: Chromosome 3, Region q22.2
* Gene ID: 93
* HGNC Symbol: ACVR2B
* Alias: Activin A receptor type IIB

### Function

ACVR2B encodes a receptor that belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type I family of proteins. It binds to activin, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, and transmits signaling downstream, ultimately leading to regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported mutations in the ACVR2B gene, including frameshift, missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations. Here are some notable ones with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|L334F|Missense (heterozygous)|rs121912683|
|G329D|Missense (heterozygous)|rs369393018|

|G323R|Missense (heterozygous)|rs397509264|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Some somatic mutations in the ACVR2B gene have also been reported, including SNVs and InDels. Here are some examples with their dbSNP ID: 

|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|
|SNV|rs267602912|
|SNV|rs267602913|
|Deletion|rs779220869|

### Related Disease

Some genetic associations of ACVR2B are:

- Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy (KOZA1): a rare condition characterized by increased muscle mass, reduced body fat, and improved strength and endurance. The ACVR2B receptor acts as a negative regulator of muscle growth by binding and inhibiting myostatin, a protein that negatively regulates muscle growth.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for genetic conditions caused by mutations in the ACVR2B gene. However, some treatments for muscle-wasting conditions may involve targeting this receptor to enhance muscle growth.

### Drug Response

Some studies suggest that blocking the ACVR2B receptor with specific drugs can promote muscle growth and reduce muscle wasting in conditions such as muscular dystrophy.
