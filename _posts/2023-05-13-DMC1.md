# Information about Gene DMC1

## Genetic Position and Pathology

The DMC1 gene is located on chromosome 22q12.3. It encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of homologous recombination, which is important for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Mutations in the DMC1 gene are associated with male infertility.

## Function of Gene

The DMC1 gene encodes a protein called DNA meiotic recombinase 1, which plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA during meiosis. Specifically, it catalyzes the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, a process known as homologous recombination.

- rs772960413
- rs786205985
- rs79704519
- rs767489468

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the DMC1 gene are associated with male infertility, specifically with maturation arrest of spermatogenesis. Some studies have also suggested a potential link between DMC1 gene variants and an increased risk of certain types of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for infertility caused by mutations in the DMC1 gene. However, there are several options available for male infertility, including assisted reproductive techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE). The prognosis for male infertility caused by DMC1 mutations varies depending on the severity of the mutation and other factors.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available about drug responses specific to mutations in the DMC1 gene.
