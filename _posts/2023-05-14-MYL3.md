# Gene Information for MYL3

## Gene Background 

MYL3, also known as Myosin Light Chain 3, is located on chromosome 3q21.1 and consists of 3 exons. The gene produces a protein that belongs to the myosin family and is involved in muscle contraction. Mutations in MYL3 have been associated with cardiomyopathy.

## Function for Gene

MYL3 encodes a regulatory myosin light chain that interacts with thick filaments in the cardiac muscles. The protein is essential for muscle contraction and relaxation. The MYL3 protein works with MYH7, a gene that encodes the beta-myosin heavy chain, to form the cardiac muscle fiber.

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for MYL3.

## Related Disease

Mutations in MYL3 have been associated with multiple diseases including:

* Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1DD (CMD1DD)
* Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 7 (CMH7)
* Left Ventricular Noncompaction 5 (LVNC5)

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for cardiomyopathy generally involves the use of medications and lifestyle changes such as avoiding strenuous activities and eating a heart-healthy diet. More severe cases may require surgical intervention such as the implantation of a pacemaker or a heart transplant.

The prognosis for MYL3-related cardiomyopathy depends on the severity of the disease and its progression. Some individuals may experience mild symptoms while others may develop heart failure or die suddenly.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on the drug response for MYL3 cardiomyopathy.
