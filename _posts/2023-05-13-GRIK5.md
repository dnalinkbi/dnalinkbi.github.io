# Gene: GRIK5

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 10, 58,617,963 - 58,739,293
- **Pathology:** The GRIK5 gene has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and epilepsy.
- **Function:** The GRIK5 gene encodes G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 2 (GIT2), which plays a role in regulating various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeleton dynamics, and neuronal development.
