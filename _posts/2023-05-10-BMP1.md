# Information about gene BMP1 

## Genetic position, pathology and function

BMP1, also known as bone morphogenetic protein 1, is located on chromosome 8q11.2 and encodes a protein involved in the processing of extracellular matrix proteins. Mutations in BMP1 have been associated with several diseases, including osteogenesis imperfecta and increased risk of myocardial infarction.

## Function for gene

BMP1 encodes a protein that is primarily involved in the processing of extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin and collagens. It plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of bone and cartilage.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several known mutations in BMP1 that are associated with disease. These include:

- c.34C>T (p.Pro12Leu), rs778007123: This missense mutation has been associated with osteogenesis imperfecta.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic mutations in BMP1.

## Related disease

Mutations in BMP1 have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Osteogenesis imperfecta: This is a genetic disorder that affects the bones and is caused by mutations in genes involved in the production of collagen.
- Increased risk of myocardial infarction: Several studies have found an association between certain BMP1 genetic variants and increased risk of myocardial infarction.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta, but treatment typically involves a combination of medications, physical therapy, and surgery to manage symptoms. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the specific genetic mutation involved.

## Drug response

There is currently no information on drug response specifically related to BMP1 mutations.
