### Gene GSTA2

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 6
- **Pathology:** The gene GSTA2 has been associated with various diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and asthma.
- **Function:** GSTA2 encodes for the protein Glutathione S-transferase alpha-2, which plays an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and oxidized lipids.
- **External IDs:** 

  - HGNC: 4631
  - NCBI Entrez: 2948
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000134200
  - OMIM: 138359
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09211

- **Aliases:** GST2, GSTA2-2, GSTYA2

- **AA mutation list:** 
    - R30K, rs2234693
    - V16A, rs11545819
    - A114V, rs8943
    - IleÂ 105Val, rs11746652
    - Gae114val, rs11545823

    - Y9F, rs2074546
    - R215W, rs1695
    - E213K, rs1800455
    
- **Mutation Type:** Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** 

  - c.365A>G, rs1695
  - c.563A>G, rs2234951


- **Related Diseases:** 
   - Asthma
   - Alzheimer's disease
   - Parkinson's disease
   - Cancer

- **Treatment and prognosis:** The role of GSTA2 in the detoxification process has led to the investigation of its potential use in cancer treatment. Studies have shown that its overexpression can lead to increased resistance to chemotherapy. However, it can also be targeted for therapy by inhibiting the enzyme's activity with specific inhibitors.

- **Drug Response:** GSTA2 activity has been shown to affect the metabolism of certain drugs, such as paracetamol and diclofenac.
