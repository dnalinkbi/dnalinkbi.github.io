# Information about Gene PVT1

## Gene Position
PVT1 gene is located on chromosome 8q24.21.

## Pathology
Overexpression of PVT1 gene is associated with several types of cancer including breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancer.

## Function
PVT1 gene encodes a long non-coding RNA which plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. It also interacts with several transcription factors and regulates gene expression.

## Related Disease
Overexpression of PVT1 gene is associated with several types of cancer including breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for PVT1 gene related disease. However, targeting PVT1 gene using antisense oligonucleotides has shown promising results in preclinical studies. Prognosis of PVT1 gene related disease depends on the stage and severity of the cancer.

## Drug Response
Several drugs targeting PVT1 gene are in preclinical stages of development. However, no drug has been approved for clinical use yet.
