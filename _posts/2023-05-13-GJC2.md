# Gene: GJC2

## Genetic Position
The GJC2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 at position 42.1.

## Pathology 
Mutations in the GJC2 gene have been associated with several diseases, including Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1X). These diseases are characterized by abnormalities in myelin formation and maintenance in the nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms such as motor and sensory dysfunction.

## Function
The GJC2 gene encodes a protein called connexin 47, which acts as a gap junction protein. Gap junctions are channels that allow for direct communication between cells, and connexin 47 is specifically expressed in oligodendrocytes, which are cells responsible for myelination in the central nervous system. Connexin 47 is thought to play a role in maintaining the tightness of myelin sheaths and facilitating communication between oligodendrocytes and other cells in the nervous system.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the GJC2 gene.

## Related Disease 
Mutations in the GJC2 gene are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1X).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for PMLD or CMT1X, and treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. In some cases, medications may be used to help with specific symptoms such as spasticity or neuropathic pain.

## Drug Response 
There is currently no information available on drug response specifically for mutations in the GJC2 gene.
