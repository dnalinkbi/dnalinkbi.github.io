## Gene: IL17F

### Gene function:
IL17F encodes for a cytokine that plays an important role in host defense and inflammatory response. It induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and is involved in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and infectious diseases.

- OMIM: 606496
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96PD4

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

There are several mutations reported in IL17F gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.

- dbSNP ID: rs763780129, Amino Acid Change: p.Trp161*, Mutation Type: Nonsense
- dbSNP ID: rs138963470, Amino Acid Change: p.His27Arg, Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs387906806, Amino Acid Change: p.Glu25*, Mutation Type: Nonsense

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for IL17F gene.

### Related disease:
IL17F has been associated with several autoimmune and infectious diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis.

### Treatment and prognosis:
Targeting IL17F cytokine or its receptors has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of such therapies are still under investigation.

### Drug response:
Several drugs targeting IL17F or its receptors, such as secukinumab and ixekizumab, have been approved for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases.
