## Gene: SLC5A1
### Genomic Location and External IDs 
- Chromosome: 22
- Genomic Position: 22q12.3
- Gene ID: 6523
- HGNC: 11065
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100286
- NCBI Entrez: 6523
- OMIM: 182307
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13866
- Aliases: SGLT1, D22S675

### Function
SLC5A1 encodes a sodium-glucose cotransporter that is responsible for the absorption of glucose and galactose in the small intestine. It plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Thr201Met (rs146833351): missense mutation with an allele frequency of <0.001. It has been associated with familial renal glucosuria.
- p.Gly28Ser (rs137853754): missense mutation associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are 66 SNPs reported in dbSNP for SLC5A1, but none of them are associated with somatic variants or cancer.

### Related Disease
Mutations in SLC5A1 have been linked to familial renal glucosuria, a rare condition in which the kidneys are unable to reabsorb glucose, resulting in glucose excretion in urine. SLC5A1 mutations have also been associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for familial renal glucosuria. Treatment typically involves a low-carbohydrate diet and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. Prognosis is generally good, with most individuals leading normal lives.

### Drug Response
SLC5A1 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs block the reabsorption of glucose in the renal tubules, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and lowered blood glucose levels.
