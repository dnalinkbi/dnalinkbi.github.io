## Gene ERMAP

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1, from base pair 207,197,768 to 207,255,449.

**Pathology:** Gene ERMAP is associated with susceptibility to Malaria and is found to be a major risk factor of cerebral malaria. It is also believed to be involved in the susceptibility to other infectious diseases.

**Function:** Gene ERMAP codes for an erythrocyte membrane-associated protein, which is believed to play a role in erythrocyte adhesion and migration. It is involved in the development and homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 3772
- NCBI Entrez: 114625
- Ensembl: ENSG00000143358
- OMIM: 609291
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q5T4F5

**Aliases:** BASIGIN, CD147, 5F7, EMMPRIN, OK, HT7.

**AA Mutation List:**
- p.Pro183Ser (rs60996596)
- p.Gly193Arg (rs61737515)
- p.Thr219Ala (rs144333427)
- p.Tyr240Asn (rs149108485)

**Mutation Type:** All mutations are missense variations.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
No somatic variations have been reported for gene ERMAP yet.

**Related Disease:** ERMAP is associated with susceptibility to Malaria, and is found to be a major risk factor of cerebral malaria.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type and severity of malaria, and other factors like age, general health, and medical history.

**Drug Response:** Some antimalarial drugs like chloroquine, quinine, and artemisinin are believed to target the erythrocyte membrane-associated proteins like ERMAP, and interfere with the erythrocyte lifecycle of the malaria parasite.
