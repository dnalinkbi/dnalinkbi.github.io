## Gene GPC3

* **Function for gene:** GPC3 encodes glypican-3 protein which has a role in regulating cell growth and division. It also acts as a co-receptor for Wnt signaling pathway.

* **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

    * Gene ID: 2719
    * Genomic Location: Chromosome X (Xq26.2)
    * Aliases: OCI-5, MXR7.


* **External sites:**
    
    * HGNC: HGNC:4477
    * NCBI Entrez: 2719
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000121410
    * OMIM: 300037
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51654


* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

    * The missense mutation p.Trp317Cys in GPC3, causing change in the amino acid at position 317, is associated with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) with OMIM: 312870.
    

* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** 

    * rs797044254: missense mutation p.Ala369Thr with breast invasive carcinoma.
    * rs200393331: missense mutation p.Ala369Ser with hepatocellular carcinoma.
    * rs794727119: missense mutation p.Ala365Pro with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

* **Related Diseases:** 

    * Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS)
    * Hepatocellular carcinoma
    * Oncocytoma
    * Wilms tumor
    * Hemangioma
    
* **Treatment and prognosis:**

    * There are no FDA approved treatments specifically targeted for GPC3-associated conditions. Treatment is symptomatic or supportive.
    * Prognosis varies depending on the specific GPC3-associated disease.
    
* **Drug response:**

    * Monoclonal antibodies (MORAB-003 and GC33) targeting GPC3 are currently under clinical evaluation for their response in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
