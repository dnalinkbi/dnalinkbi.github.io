# Information about gene KCNJ8

## Genetic position
The gene KCNJ8 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12p12.1). It spans about 47 kilobases and contains 2 exons.

## Pathology
Variants in KCNJ8 have been associated with several cardiovascular diseases, including long QT syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and congenital heart disease.

## Function for gene
KCNJ8 encodes the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir6.1, which plays an important role in regulating the resting potential and electrical activity of cardiac muscle cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic variants have been reported in KCNJ8.

## Related disease
Variants in KCNJ8 have been associated with long QT syndrome type 9 (LQT9), atrial fibrillation (ATFB6), and atrial standstill 2 (ATSA2).

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for KCNJ8-related disorders includes medications to manage arrhythmias, implantation of a pacemaker or defibrillator, and lifestyle changes such as avoiding triggers for arrhythmia. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
Variants in KCNJ8 have been associated with altered drug response to antiarrhythmic medications.
