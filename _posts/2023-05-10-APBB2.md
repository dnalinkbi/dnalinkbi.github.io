# Information about Gene APBB2

## Genetic Position
- **Chromosome**: 4
- **Location**: 4q21.1

## Pathology
- **Disease**: Alzheimer's Disease
- **Pathology**: APBB2 is involved in the amyloid-beta peptide generation process, which is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, APBB2 has been shown to modulate the activity of gamma-secretase, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloid-beta peptide.

## Function for Gene
- **Function**: The APBB2 gene is involved in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP), which contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the protein encoded by this gene can act as a transcriptional co-activator in certain contexts.

- **Ensembl ID**: ENSG00000138620
- **OMIM ID**: 605508
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID**: Q9UBB4

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- **Mutation**: rs141432710
  - **Type**: Missense
  - **AA change**: E129K
- **Mutation**: rs141426528
  - **Type**: Missense
  - **AA change**: E20K
