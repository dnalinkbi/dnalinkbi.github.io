## Gene: PDX1
### Summary
PDX1 gene encodes for a transcription factor that plays an important role in pancreas development and maintaining beta-cell function in adults. Mutations in the PDX1 gene are associated with diabetes mellitus type 4.

### Function
PDX1 gene functions as an activator of insulin gene transcription and is essential for the differentiation of pancreatic cells. PDX1 also regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolic regulation and the function of beta cells.
