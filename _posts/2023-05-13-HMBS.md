# Information on HMBS Gene 

## Gene Function 
The HMBS gene encodes for the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase, which is involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Specifically, it catalyzes the condensation of four molecules of porphobilinogen into hydroxymethylbilane, the third to last step in the heme biosynthesis pathway. 

## Gene Identifier and Aliases 
- HGNC: 5005 
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 3145 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000134804 
- OMIM: 609806 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08397 
- Aliases: PBGD, URO3 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID 
There are various amino acid (AA) mutations that have been reported for the HMBS gene, which are associated with the development of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). Some of these mutations include: 
- E47K 
- R116W 
- P177L 
- V215E 
- P234L 

These mutations are all missense mutations, meaning that a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein sequence. Each mutation has a unique dbSNP identifier, which is specific to that particular genetic variation. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in the HMBS gene have been reported in certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the frequency of these mutations is relatively low. Some somatic mutations that have been identified include: 
- c.128delT 
- c.766G>A 
- c.800G>T 
- c.802T>G 

Each mutation has a unique dbSNP identifier, which is specific to that particular genetic variation. 

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HMBS gene are associated with a rare autosomal dominant disorder called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). This disorder is characterized by recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and confusion. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for AIP typically involves the administration of heme, which serves as a cofactor for the deficient enzyme. Hematin or heme arginate are some of the heme preparations commonly used in treatment, and are usually administered intravenously. In addition, symptomatic treatment may be given to alleviate symptoms such as pain and nausea. 
The prognosis for individuals with AIP is good if the diagnosis is made early and treatment is started promptly. However, if left untreated, AIP can lead to chronic symptoms and potential complications such as kidney failure and peripheral neuropathy. 

## Drug Response
The response to treatment varies among individuals with AIP. Some individuals require lifelong treatment with heme, while others may only need treatment during acute attacks. In addition, certain medications such as barbiturates and sulfonamides should be avoided in individuals with AIP as they can trigger attacks.
