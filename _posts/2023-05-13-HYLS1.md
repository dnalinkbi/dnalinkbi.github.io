# Gene Information for HYLS1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11q24.3

**Function:** HYLS1 (Hydrolethalus Syndrome 1) gene encodes for centriolar coiled-coil protein, involved in the biogenesis of cilia and flagella. It also plays a significant role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 32213
- NCBI Entrez: 57505
- Ensembl: ENSG00000072736
- OMIM: 236680
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q68DK2

**Aliases:** FLJ10840, HYLS, C11orf70

**AA Mutation List:**

The HYLS1 gene has a total of 38 missense mutations as per the COSMIC database. Some of the variants include:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| R1740Q | Missense | rs186285474 |
| A1426T | Missense | rs181310505 |
| G1003D | Missense | rs755710464 |
| S904L | Missense | rs762940478 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

There are no records of somatic SNVs/InDels for the HYLS1 gene.

**Related Disease:**

Mutations in HYLS1 gene are related to Hydrolethalus syndrome (HLS), a rare autosomal recessive, lethal neural tube defect with severe congenital malformations.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is no specific treatment for Hydrolethalus syndrome. Those affected usually do not survive birth or die soon after. 

**Drug Response:**

There is no known drug response related to HYLS1 gene.
