# Information about Gene NPPC

## Gene Position
The NPPC gene is located on chromosome 2q37.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the NPPC gene have been associated with acromesomelic dysplasia, Maroteaux type (AMDM) and skeletal dysplasia with bone mineral density (BMD) and ossification defects.

## Function
The NPPC gene encodes for natriuretic peptide precursor C. This protein acts as a vasodilator and regulates blood pressure, and is involved in bone growth and calcium regulation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for NPPC gene.

## Related Disease
- Acromesomelic dysplasia, Maroteaux type (AMDM)
- Skeletal dysplasia with bone mineral density (BMD) and ossification defects.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of NPPC-related disorders depend on the specific diagnosis and symptoms present in each individual case.

## Drug Response
Further studies are needed to determine the potential drug response of NPPC-related disorders.
