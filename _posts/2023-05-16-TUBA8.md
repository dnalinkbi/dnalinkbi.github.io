# Information about Gene TUBA8

## Genetic Position
TUBA8 is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 at position 22q13.1.

## Pathology
TUBA8 gene is associated with a rare autosomal recessive disease called polymicrogyria with seizures (PMGYS) which is characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, and seizures.

## Function for Gene
TUBA8 is a member of the alpha-tubulin family which is involved in forming microtubules, a component of the cellular cytoskeleton.
