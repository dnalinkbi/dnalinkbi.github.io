### Gene Information

**Gene Symbol:** PDE8B

**Pathology:** PDE8B gene mutations have been associated with autosomal recessive mental retardation-18 (MRT18) and spastic paraplegia-54 (SPG54).

**Function:** The PDE8B gene encodes a protein called phosphodiesterase 8B, which is involved in the regulation of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways. Specifically, PDE8B hydrolyzes the second messenger molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to its inactive 5'-AMP form. This process helps in controlling various physiological processes, including smooth muscle relaxation, insulin secretion, platelet aggregation, and inflammation.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** None reported.

**Related Diseases:** 

1. Autosomal recessive mental retardation-18 (MRT18)
2. Spastic paraplegia-54 (SPG54)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no specific treatment for MRT18 and SPG54, and the prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition.

**Drug Response:** Not applicable.
