### Gene: TGFBR1

#### Function
Transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase receptor, a type I receptor for TGF-beta superfamily ligands. The encoded protein acts as a tumor suppressor. Several missense mutations in this gene have been associated with genetic predisposition to a variety of human cancers, including colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and breast cancer.

#### AA Mutation List
- p.Asp17Tyr, rs121912632
- p.Arg190Cys, rs121912634
- p.Val190Glu, rs121912633
- p.Arg246Gly, rs121912635
- p.Trp249Arg, rs11540652

All these mutations are missense mutations.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are several somatic mutations present in the TGFBR1 gene that can cause different types of cancer. Here are a few examples:
- c.1227G>A, p.Gly409Arg, rs34186406
- c.1549G>A, p.Gly517Arg, rs1046333
- c.1753G>A, p.Glu585Lys, rs17587023

#### Related Disease
- Colorectal Cancer
- Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
- Breast Cancer

#### Treatment and Prognosis
Several treatments and therapies can help patients with TGFBR1 mutations. Targeted therapy with TGFBR1 inhibitors has shown promising results in preclinical studies. However, clinical trials are required to evaluate their safety and effectiveness.

#### Drug Response
