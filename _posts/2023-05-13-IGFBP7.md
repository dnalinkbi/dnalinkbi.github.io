# Information on Gene IGFBP7

## Genetic Position
- The gene IGFBP7 is located on the long arm of chromosome 4, specifically at position 4q12.
- It spans around 40.87 kilobases in length.

## Pathology
- IGFBP7 has been found to be significantly altered in various types of cancers like liver, breast, prostate, and lung cancer.
- Its expression has been associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness and metastasis.
- Studies have also suggested an association between IGFBP7 and cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

## Function for Gene
- IGFBP7 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways. 
- It acts mainly as a tumor suppressor by regulating cellular growth and differentiation.
- It modulates the action of IGF by regulating its bioavailability and enhancing its activity.
- In addition to its anti-tumor properties, IGFBP7 has also been found to promote apoptosis, autophagy, and cellular senescence.
