## Gene: COQ2

### Function:
COQ2 encodes an enzyme called para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an important component of the electron transport chain and cellular respiration.

### External IDs and Location:
- HGNC ID: 22296
- Entrez Gene ID: 27235
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000101475
- OMIM ID: 609825
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9Y6A9
- Genomic location: Chromosome 4q21.23

### AA mutation list and mutation type:
- Lys182Gln (missense variant) rs72555387
- Cys87Ser (missense variant) rs28937597
- Ala227Val (missense variant) rs1800607

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
Not reported

### Related Disease:
- Primary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency - COQ2-related

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no cure for coenzyme Q10 deficiencies. Treatment is usually supportive and involves supplementation with high doses of CoQ10. The prognosis varies and depends on the severity of the deficiency and the specific symptoms.

### Drug Response:
There are no known drugs that specifically target COQ2, but drugs that indirectly increase CoQ10 levels, such as mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, have been shown to improve symptoms in some patients with CoQ10 deficiencies.
