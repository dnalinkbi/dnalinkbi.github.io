## Gene: CYP2C18 

### 1. Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

- **Genetic Position**: CYP2C18 is located on chromosome 10q23.33.

- **Pathology**: CYP2C18 is associated with Breast cancer, Prostate cancer, and Colorectal cancer.

- **Function**: CYP2C18 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes which play a pivotal role in drug metabolism. The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of several clinically important drugs, including phenacetin, tolbutamide, and S-warfarin.
