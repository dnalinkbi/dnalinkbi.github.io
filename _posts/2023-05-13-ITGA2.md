## Information about gene ITGA2 

### Genetic Position 

The gene ITGA2 is located on chromosome 5 at position 5q11.2. 

### Pathology 

Mutations in the ITGA2 gene have been linked to platelet-type bleeding disorder-16 (BDPLT16). This is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding. 

### Function 

The ITGA2 gene encodes for the integrin alpha-2 protein, which is a receptor for collagen and laminin in blood vessel walls and platelets. Upon binding to collagen, integrin alpha-2 activates platelets, leading to blood clot formation.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 

There are no known somatic mutations in the ITGA2 gene. 

### Related Disease 

Mutations in the ITGA2 gene have been linked to platelet-type bleeding disorder-16 (BDPLT16). 

### Treatment and Prognosis 

Treatment for BDPLT16 involves platelet transfusions and avoidance of drugs that interfere with platelet function. The prognosis for individuals with BDPLT16 is generally good, as bleeding episodes tend to be mild to moderate in severity. 

### Drug Response 

Individuals with BDPLT16 may have altered drug responses to certain medications that affect platelet function. It is important for affected individuals to inform their healthcare providers of their condition to avoid potential drug complications.
