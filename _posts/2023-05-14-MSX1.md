# Gene MSX1

MSX1 (Msh homeobox 1) is a gene located on chromosome 4 at the locus 4p16.3. It encodes a protein that belongs to the family of homeobox proteins, which act as transcription factors and play important roles in embryonic development and cell differentiation.

## Function

MSX1 plays a crucial role in the development of teeth, craniofacial structures, and limbs, and is also involved in bone formation and development of the nervous system. It regulates the expression of various genes involved in these processes.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Several mutations in MSX1 have been associated with genetic disorders such as Witkop syndrome, tooth agenesis, cleft palate, and nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. Here are some examples of AA mutations with their dbSNP ID and mutation type:

- V18A (rs114604195) missense mutation
- R27W (rs121912984) missense mutation
- P50L (rs121912983) missense mutation
- Q176K (rs137854306) missense mutation
- P148S (rs121912982) missense mutation
- G176V (rs137854307) missense mutation

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic SNVs and InDels have also been reported in MSX1. Here are some examples with their dbSNP ID:

- rs784045081: C > T
- rs761106704: G > T
- rs768037861: A > C

## Related disease

Mutations in MSX1 have been associated with the following diseases:

- Witkop syndrome (WS1)
- Selective tooth agenesis (STHAG5)
- Orofacial cleft 5 (OFC5)
- Craniosynostosis type 2 (CS2)
- Tooth agenesis, selective, X-linked, with or without cleft palate (STHAGX)
- Ectodermal dysplasia 3, Witkop type (ECTD3)

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for conditions related to MSX1 mutations is symptomatic and focuses on addressing associated abnormalities such as tooth agenesis or cleft palate. The prognosis depends on the severity of the specific condition and any associated abnormalities.

## Drug response

No specific drugs have been developed to target MSX1 mutations. Treatment is usually based on managing associated symptoms and abnormalities.
