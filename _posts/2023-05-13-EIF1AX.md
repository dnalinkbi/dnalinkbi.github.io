## Information on Gene EIF1AX

### Genetic position:
EIF1AX is located on the X chromosome at position Xq26.1.

### Pathology:
The mutations in the EIF1AX gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including uveal melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

### Function:
EIF1AX, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, is involved in translation initiation. It plays a crucial role in the binding of the initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit, which is necessary for initiating protein synthesis.

### Related disease:
EIF1AX mutations have been associated with various types of cancer, including uveal melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

### Treatment and prognosis:
Due to the limited studies on EIF1AX mutations, appropriate treatment and prognosis are not yet established.

### Drug response:
There is insufficient information on the drug response of patients with EIF1AX mutations.
