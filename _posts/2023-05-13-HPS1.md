# Gene HPS1

## Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 10q24.2
- **Pathology:** Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 1
- **Function:** Encodes for a protein that is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles.
- **Aliases:** HPS, DKFZP564M0824, FA7, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 1 protein, muted
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 5028
    - NCBI Entrez: 3257
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000154167
    - OMIM: 604982
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q92902

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation list:** [Click here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=HPS1%5Bgene%5D))
- **Mutation type:** Missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, insertion, deletion
- **dbSNP ID:** rs104894399, rs139602837, rs6444358

## Related Disease

- **Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 1:** A rare disorder characterized by albinism, bleeding disorders, and progressive lung and bowel disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, there is no cure for Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 1. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, involved in identifying and managing organ-specific complications. People with HPS1 can have a shortened lifespan due to the development of severe lung fibrosis.

## Drug response

- There have been no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 1, but in some cases, drugs such as anticoagulants or corticosteroids can be used to treat specific complications.
