## Function of EPAS1 Gene

The EPAS1 gene encodes for the hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2alpha) protein. HIF-2alpha is a transcription factor that is involved in oxygen homeostasis and the regulation of genes that control erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

The EPAS1 gene has several reported mutations. Here is a list of some common mutations along with their mutation types and corresponding dbSNP IDs:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| R247Q       | Missense    | [rs200527355](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs200527355/)) |

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the EPAS1 gene have been found to be associated with various diseases, including:

- Congenital erythrocytosis with pseudo-varied oxygen affinity (CEPVA)
- Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
- Polycythemia
- Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known cure for diseases caused by mutations in the EPAS1 gene. However, symptoms can be managed through various treatments. In some cases, bone marrow transplantation may be considered.

Prognosis can vary depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of EPAS1-related diseases. However, drugs used to manage the symptoms of these diseases may include:

- Hydroxyurea
- Interferon-alpha
- Blood thinners
