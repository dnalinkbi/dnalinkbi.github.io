# Information about Gene CD151

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

### Genetic Position
The gene CD151 is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5). The gene spans a genomic region of approximately 14 kilobases and consists of four exons.

### Pathology
CD151 has been associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. In particular, the overexpression of CD151 has been observed in various types of cancer, including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer.

### Function
CD151 encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the tetraspanin superfamily of proteins. The protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. CD151 has been shown to interact with integrins and other tetraspanins, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis.
