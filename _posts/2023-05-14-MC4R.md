# Gene MC4R

MC4R is a gene which encodes for the melanocortin-4 receptor protein. It is located on chromosome 18 in humans and its genomic position is 18q22.2. This gene plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. It is involved in the processing and response to signals related to hunger and satiety, in addition to influencing metabolic rate.

## Function for gene

The MC4R protein is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and inhibited by agouti-related protein (AGRP). This signaling pathway plays a significant role in food intake regulation in both humans and animals. Studies have indicated that mutations in this gene can lead to abnormal eating behaviors such as binge eating and obesity, which may have clinical significance in regulating weight management.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Variations and mutations in MC4R can lead to different phenotypes. Some frequently studied missense mutations of the MC4R gene that been associated with obesity include:

1. rs17782313 (p.Tyr35Ter)
2. rs2229616 (p.Ile251Thr)
3. rs2229618 (p.Val103Ile)
4. rs1042714 (p.Val81Met)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is limited information regarding somatic mutations in MC4R. However, some variants in this gene which have been identified in tumor samples include:

- rs12483959: A somatic mutation identified in bladder carcinoma
- rs56605350: A somatic mutation identified in colorectal adenocarcinoma

## Related disease

Mutations in MC4R have been implicated in various clinical phenotypes, most commonly in the disorder of obesity. Some other conditions associated with mutations in this gene include:

- Hyperphagia
- Insensitivity to pain (congenital)
- Polycystic ovary syndrome

## Treatment and prognosis

Medical intervention to manage obesity in patients with MC4R mutations often involves a combination of lifestyle modifications, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy. Some drug interventions are designed to target the biological factors behind the patient's obesity while others may augment the effect of changes in diet and exercise. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in MC4R varies based on the severity of the mutation and the resulting clinical phenotype.

## Drug response

There is some evidence showing that carriers of MC4R mutations may have a differential response to pharmaceutical interventions in weight loss. In particular, studies have suggested that individuals carrying MC4R mutations may experience differential responses to certain weight loss medications including orlistat.
