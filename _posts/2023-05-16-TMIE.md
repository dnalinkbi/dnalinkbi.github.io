## Gene TMIE

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 10:7471655-7493355

**Function:** The TMIE gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is involved in the auditory system's function. It plays a role in the mechanotransduction of hair cells in the inner ear.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 28932
- NCBI Entrez: 64380
- Ensembl: ENSG00000181806
- OMIM: 607237
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8TB84

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- c.233G>A (p.Asp78Asn) - rs17853530
- c.419T>C (p.Tyr140His) - rs150949762
- c.794G>T (p.Met265Ile) - rs142987283

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
No known somatic mutations in TMIE gene.

**Related Disease:** DFNB6 nonsyndromic hearing loss

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for DFNB6 nonsyndromic hearing loss. Treatment options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and genetic counseling.

**Drug Response:** No known drug response information.
