## Gene KRT6A

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 53.32 - 53.39 Mb

### Pathology
KRT6A gene mutations have been associated with various skin disorders such as pachyonychia congenita and psoriasis.

### Function 
KRT6A is a member of the keratin protein family. These proteins are involved in the formation and protection of epithelial cells in skin, hair, and nails. KRT6A specifically is expressed in the basal cells of stratified epithelia.

### Related Disease
- Pachyonychia Congenita
- Psoriasis
- Epidermolysis bullosa simplex

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for genetic skin disorders caused by KRT6A mutations. Treatment is focused on symptom management through skin moisturization, pain relief, and wound care.

### Drug Response
There is limited data available on drug response specific to KRT6A mutations.
