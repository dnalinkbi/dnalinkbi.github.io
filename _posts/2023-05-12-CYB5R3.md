## Gene: CYB5R3

- **Function of gene**: CYB5R3 gene encodes NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme that is responsible for maintaining the balance between oxidized and reduced cytochromes. The enzyme has a significant role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, drug metabolism, and steroidogenesis.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - A missense mutation in the CYB5R3 gene (c.100C>A; p.Pro34His) was reported in a Japanese patient with type I congenital methemoglobinemia. dbSNP ID: rs121965161
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
    - No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in CYB5R3 gene

- **Related disease**:
    - CYB5R3 gene mutations have been associated with type I congenital methemoglobinemia, which is a rare genetic blood disorder characterized by the inability of red blood cells to release oxygen to tissues leading to blue discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. 

- **Treatment and prognosis**:
    - Treatment options for methemoglobinemia involve the use of methylene blue, which is a reducing agent that converts the oxidized form of hemoglobin to the normal form. Blood transfusion may also be necessary in severe cases. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for methemoglobinemia patients is generally good.

- **Drug response**:
    - No information about drug response related to CYB5R3 gene is available.
