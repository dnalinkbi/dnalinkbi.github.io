## Gene PSORS10

### Genetic Position
PSORS10, or psoriasis susceptibility 10, is a gene located on chromosome 1q21.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in PSORS10 have been linked to susceptibility to psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide.

### Function
The exact function of PSORS10 is not fully understood, but it is believed to be involved in regulating the immune system's response to various stimuli.
