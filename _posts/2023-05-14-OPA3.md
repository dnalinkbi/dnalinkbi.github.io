# Gene OPA3

OPA3 is a human gene located on chromosome 19q13.32. The gene encodes for a protein, Optic Atrophy 3 Protein, that is primarily involved in mitochondrial function and morphology. This gene is associated with various diseases involving optic atrophy and syndromic cataracts.

## Gene Function
The OPA3 protein plays an important role in mitochondrial fusion, cristae organization, and ATP production. The protein is primarily expressed in the retina, optic nerve, and brain tissue. Mutations in this gene lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, causing defects in the optic nerve and leading to optic atrophy.

Aliases: 3-MGA syndrome, type II; ATD; Costeff syndrome; Deafness, autosomal dominant 85; Kjer type optic atrophy

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
Missense variations in the OPA3 gene lead to mutation in gene function. Some of the reported missense variations in the OPA3 gene and their dbSNP IDs are as follows:

- p.Arg38Gln rs80338943
- p.Tyr46Cys rs200186873
- p.Thr135Pro rs80338944

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no report of somatic SNVs/InDels for the OPA3 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the OPA3 gene are associated with various diseases involving optic atrophy and syndromic cataracts. Some of the related diseases are:

- 3-MGA syndrome, type II
- Optic atrophy 3 with cataract
- Neuropathy, hereditary motor and sensory, type VIIC
- Dominant optic atrophy plus syndrome (DOA+)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for diseases caused by OPA3 gene mutations. The treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive, and the prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the age at onset.

## Drug Response
There are no specific drugs available for the treatment of diseases caused by OPA3 gene mutations. However, some treatments such as antioxidants, vitamins, and nutritional supplements have been shown to be effective in improving the optic nerve function and visual acuity.
