# Gene Information: CFL2

## Gene Pathology and Function
CFL2 is a gene associated with cytoskeleton reorganization and muscle contraction. It encodes cofilin-2, an actin-binding protein that promotes actin filament depolymerization and contributes to cell motility, cytokinesis, endocytosis, and vesicular trafficking.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in CFL2 have been associated with nemaline myopathy (NM), which is a group of inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and the presence of nemaline rods in muscle fibers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for nemaline myopathy, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. This may include physical therapy, respiratory support, and surgery in some cases.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to CFL2 mutations and NM in general. Treatment is generally supportive.
