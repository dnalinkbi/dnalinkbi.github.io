# Gene EED

## Genetic Position
The EED gene is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q14.2.

## Pathology
EED gene mutations have been implicated in various types of cancers including myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, and bladder cancer. Additionally, mutations in EED have been associated with Weaver syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by rapid growth, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities.

## Function
The EED gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which helps regulate gene expression through chromatin modification.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no targeted therapies for EED mutations. Treatment of associated diseases typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transplant. Prognosis varies depending on disease severity and response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response specific to EED mutations at this time.
