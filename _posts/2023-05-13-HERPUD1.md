## Gene Information

### Gene Name 
HERPUD1

### Function
This gene encodes a stress-inducible membrane protein, which is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It plays a role in limiting ER stress by regulating the degradation of unfolded protein response (UPR) target proteins. This gene is also known to interact with major viral glycoproteins and modulate virus infection. 

### External IDs

### Genomic location
The HERPUD1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q34.2).

### Aliases
- HERP
- HERP1
