## Gene: SEMG1

### Position
SEMG1 is a gene located on chromosome 20q12.

### Pathology
There is no specific pathology associated with SEMG1 mutations or dysregulation. However, it has been suggested that the protein encoded by SEMG1 may play a role in prostate cancer as it is expressed specifically in the prostate gland and its secretions.

### Function
The SEMG1 gene encodes for semenogelin-1 protein, which is abundant in the seminal fluid and is involved in the formation of semen coagulum after ejaculation. It has also been suggested to possess potential antimicrobial activity in the reproductive tract.
