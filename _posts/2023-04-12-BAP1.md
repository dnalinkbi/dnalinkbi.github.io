## Information about gene BAP1

BAP1 gene is located on chromosome 3p21.1 and encodes for the BRCA1-associated protein 1, which functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme. It is also known as the UCHL1 gene.

**Function for gene:** 
The BAP1 gene is involved in regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response, and chromatin remodeling. It acts as a tumor suppressor by maintaining the proper cell growth and division.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
- HGNC: 18224
- NCBI Entrez: 8314
- Ensembl: ENSG00000117318
- OMIM: 603089
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q92560

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- BAP1 mutations are mostly found in the germline and somatic cells of patients with cancer.
- Some of the AA mutations include:
    - c.156_157insAlaSerGlnThr (p.Ser53HisfsTer5) insertion mutation
    - c.1668 delC (p.Pro557fs) frameshift mutation
- dbSNP ID: rs180177135, rs3731249

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- Some of the somatic SNVs and InDels in the BAP1 gene include:
    - c.1010T>C (p.Phe337Leu) missense mutation
    - c.858+1G>A splice site mutation
- dbSNP ID: rs529432583, rs149574082

**Related disease:**
- BAP1 gene is associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers such as mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.

**Treatment and prognosis:**
- Prognosis for cancers associated with BAP1 gene mutations is generally poor.
- There are ongoing clinical trials targeting BAP1 mutations in various cancer types.

**Drug response:**
- There are no drugs currently approved specifically for targeting BAP1 mutations.
