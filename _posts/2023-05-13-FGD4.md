# Gene FGD4

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 12q15
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the FGD4 gene may lead to rare autosomal recessive disorders, including hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement (OMIM #601097) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4H (OMIM #609311).
- **Function:** FGD4 encodes a protein that participates in the regulation of cell morphology, adhesion, and migration by activating Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases. FGD4 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system.

- **Mutation type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs587777983, rs587777984, rs587777985

## Somatic variants
- There are no somatic variants reported for FGD4 as it is not a known driver gene in cancer.

## Related diseases
- Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement (OMIM #601097)
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4H (OMIM #609311)

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment for FGD4-related disorders is symptomatic and may include physical therapy, orthopedic management, and pain management.
- The prognosis for patients with FGD4-related neuropathies varies depending on the severity of symptoms and disease progression.

## Drug response
- There is currently no known drug therapy specific to FGD4-related neuropathies.
