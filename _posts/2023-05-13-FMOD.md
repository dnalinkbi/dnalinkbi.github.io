## Gene: FMOD

### Genetic position and aliases
- Chromosome: 1q32.1-q32.3
- Gene ID: 2335 
- Genomic location: NC_000001.11 (362,159,479... 362,237,294)
- Aliases: SLRR2F 

### Function for gene 
FMOD encodes for a small proteoglycan protein called 'Fibromodulin' that's present in the extracellular matrix of many connective tissues. FMOD acts as a stabilizer of collagens and regulates the size of collagen fibrils in tissues.

### External IDs and sites
- HGNC: 3766
- NCBI Entrez: 2335 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130708
- OMIM: 601912
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95426

### AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations present in the FMOD gene, following are a few examples with their mutation type and dbSNP ID: 
- Lys21Thr (Missense) with dbSNP ID: rs61752058
- Arg226Ter (Nonsense) with dbSNP ID: rs137853237

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Few examples of somatic SNVs/InDels present in the FMOD gene are as follows:

- rs876660225 (SNV)

### Related disease
Mutations or alterations in the FMOD gene have been linked to a few common disorders, including Musculoskeletal Diseases, Osteochondrodysplasias, and Lumbar Disc Herniation.

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment and prognosis mainly depend on the type and severity of the disease related to FMOD gene, and therefore should be discussed with a medical professional.

### Drug response
There is no specific drug to treat FMOD gene-related disorders.
