## Gene: PTHLH

### Genetic Position
The PTHLH (parathyroid hormone-like hormone) gene is located on chromosome 12q13.1.

### Pathology
Mutations or alterations in the PTHLH gene can result in various disorders such as brachydactyly type E2, brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome, enchondromatosis, Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, and Blomstrand chondroplasia.

### Function
PTHLH gene encodes the parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHrP) which plays a crucial role in the regulation of skeletal development and bone homeostasis. Moreover, PTHrP is also involved in the regulation of placental and mammary gland development.

### External IDs and Aliases
External IDs of the PTHLH gene include:
- HGNC: 9609
- NCBI Entrez: 5744
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135446
- OMIM: 168470
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P12272

Aliases of the PTHLH gene include:
- BDE2
- PTHR

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some of the amino acid (AA) mutations that have been reported in the PTHLH gene are:
- c.183G>A (p.Gly61Ser) - rs199738889
- c.139G>C (p.Arg47Pro) - rs387907065
- c.116A>G (p.Asp39Gly) - rs116409904

The mutation types vary, and include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) have been reported in the PTHLH gene. Some examples of these SNVs/InDels with their respective dbSNP IDs are:
- c.198A>T (p.Glu66Val) - rs2070711
- c.572G>A (p.Trp191*) - rs749166728
- c.149G>A (p.Glu50Lys) - rs72557968

### Related Disease
The PTHLH gene is associated with various diseases such as:
- Brachydactyly type E2
- Brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome
- Enchondromatosis
- Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia
- Blomstrand chondroplasia

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of disorders associated with the PTHLH gene vary depending on the specific disease and its severity. Several treatments, such as surgical interventions, bone-targeting drugs, and growth hormone therapy, may be utilized.

### Drug Response
There is limited information regarding drug response related to the PTHLH gene.
