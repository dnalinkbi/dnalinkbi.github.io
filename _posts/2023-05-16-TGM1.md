# Gene Information: TGM1

## Genetic Position
TGM1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 at position 11.2. 

## Pathology
Mutations in the TGM1 gene cause a rare, autosomal recessive skin disorder called lamellar ichthyosis. This disorder is characterized by the presence of large, dark scales all over the body, severely affecting the skin's appearance and functionality.

## Function
TGM1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 1. This enzyme plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of the skin's protective barrier. It crosslinks certain proteins in the skin, which helps create a sturdy barrier to prevent water loss and protects against foreign pathogens.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- TGM1 mutations that lead to Lamellar Ichthyosis are mostly missense or nonsense mutations.
- The following are the most common TGM1 mutations that cause Lamellar Ichthyosis:
    - c.307T>C (p.Leu103Pro) rs80338783
    - c.728G>A (p.Trp243Ter) rs104894365
    - c.1409G>A (p.Glu470Lys) rs104894364
    - c.1502G>A (p.Arg501His) rs104894363
    - c.1579C>T (p.Arg527Cys) rs104894362

## Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the TGM1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the TGM1 gene cause a rare genetic skin disorder called lamellar ichthyosis (LI). It is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the skin's ability to shed dead skin cells. As a result, large, dark scales appear all over the body, severely affecting the skin's appearance and functionality. The disorder is usually diagnosed after birth, and there is no complete cure available as of now. However, treatments such as topical creams and oral medications can help alleviate symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no complete cure for lamellar ichthyosis due to TGM1 mutations. However, treatments such as topical emollients and keratolytic agents can help manage the symptoms. In more severe cases, there is a need for systemic retinoid medication along with supportive therapies. Prognosis and life expectancy for patients with LI vary depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response
Oral retinoids can improve the symptoms of LI. However, long-term usage can pose severe side effects such as stunted growth, bone absorption, and liver damage.
