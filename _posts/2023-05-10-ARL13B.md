## Gene ARL13B

* **Genetic Position:** ARL13B gene is located on chromosome 3 at the location 3p21.31.

* **Function for Gene:** ARL13B encodes for a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein (ARL) family, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, intracellular vesicular transport, and cilia formation.

* **External IDs and Aliases:**
  * HGNC: 27256
  * NCBI Entrez: 200894
  * Ensembl: ENSG00000143283
  * OMIM: 608922
  * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N726
  
* **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
  * p.Glu330Lys (missense mutation) - rs121908005
  * p.Arg103* (nonsense mutation) - rs41305626
  * p.Ser125* (nonsense mutation) - rs145387322
  
* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  * c.106-10G>A - rs3820420
  * c.106-11C>T - rs28890818
  * c.979C>T - rs145016202
  
* **Related Disease:** Mutations in ARL13B gene have been associated with several genetic disorders such as Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Meckel syndrome.

* **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure available for the genetic diseases caused by ARL13B mutations. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis of the disease depends on the severity and type of the mutation.

* **Drug Response:** There is no known drug available for the treatment of ARL13B-associated genetic disorders.
