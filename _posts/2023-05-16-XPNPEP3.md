# Gene XPNPEP3

## Genetic Position

The gene XPNPEP3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13.2)

## Pathology

Mutations or abnormalities in the XPNPEP3 gene have been implicated in several diseases including hearing loss, autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability.

## Function

The XPNPEP3 gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein called X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3, which plays a role in the breakdown of small proteins in the mitochondria. The exact function of this protein is still not fully understood.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no somatic mutations reported for the XPNPEP3 gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the XPNPEP3 gene have been associated with non-syndromic hearing impairment, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and developmental delay.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There are no specific treatments available for XPNPEP3-associated diseases. Treatment is generally symptom-based and may include hearing aids, speech therapy, and educational interventions for intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response for XPNPEP3-associated diseases.
