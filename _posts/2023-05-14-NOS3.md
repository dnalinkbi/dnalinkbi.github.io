## Gene Information
- **Gene:** NOS3
- **External IDs:** HGNC:7873, NCBI Entrez:4846, Ensembl:ENSG00000164867, OMIM:163729, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P29474
- **Aliases:** eNOS

## Function
NOS3 gene encodes a nitric oxide synthase, which catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) that signals diverse biological processes. The enzyme plays a crucial role in vascular homeostasis by regulating blood pressure, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis. It is also involved in neurotransmission, immune response, and skeletal muscle function.

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Mutation
- **Genomic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q35-q36.1)
- **Mutation Type:** Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (InDels), copy number variants (CNVs)
- **AA Mutation List:** Some of the missense mutations in NOS3 gene are V44A, E298D, G298S, D298E, T787A, R786W, R269Q, NOS399, etc.
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs1800783, rs2070744, rs2303138, rs2074688, rs2853795, rs1799983, rs2070743, rs2070745, rs9614158, etc.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** A few somatic mutations have been reported in the NOS3 gene in various tumors, but their functional significance remains unclear.
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs201359194, rs10277210, rs202564532, rs794729864, etc.

## Related Disease and Drug Response
- **Disease:** Mutations in NOS3 gene have been associated with several cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. They are also linked to endothelial dysfunction, diabetes, and erectile dysfunction.
- **Drug Response:** NOS3 gene polymorphisms are known to affect the response to various drugs used in cardiovascular diseases, such as statins, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- **Treatment:** There is no specific treatment for NOS3 gene mutations, but the associated cardiovascular diseases can be managed with lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery depending on the severity of the condition.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis of NOS3 gene mutations depends on the specific variant and the associated disease.
