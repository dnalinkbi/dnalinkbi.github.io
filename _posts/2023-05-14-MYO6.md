## Gene MYO6

- **Function:** The MYO6 gene encodes a protein called myosin VI, which is involved in cellular movement and transportation. Specifically, myosin VI has been shown to play a role in the movement of particles within cells and in the transport of certain proteins to cellular structures called cilia and flagella.

- **External IDs:** Gene ID: 4646 | Genomic location: Chr 6q13 | Aliases: DFNA22, DFNB37, MYH14

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| p.Glu1692Lys | Missense | rs587777925 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No significant somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported in MYO6 gene.

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the MYO6 gene have been associated with several genetic conditions, including deafness, autosomal recessive 37 (DFNB37) and autosomal dominant deafness 22 (DFNA22).

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for DFNB37 or DFNA22, but hearing aids or cochlear implants can help manage hearing loss. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of hearing loss and other associated symptoms.

- **Drug Response:** There is no specific drug targeting MYO6 gene mutations or hearing loss caused by them.
