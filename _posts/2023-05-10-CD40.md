## Gene CD40

### Genetic Position 
The gene CD40 is located on chromosome 20 at position p13.

### Pathology 
CD40 is associated with various pathologies such as autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency syndromes, and cancer. Mutations or dysregulation of CD40 can lead to abnormal immune responses and inflammation.

### Function 
CD40 is a transmembrane receptor protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. It is mainly expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages. CD40 receptor interacts with its ligand CD40L which is expressed on T cells. This interaction plays a significant role in the initiation of T-cell-dependent immune responses. CD40 signaling in APCs can activate various downstream pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK leading to the production of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules required for T-cell activation and differentiation.

### Related disease 
The CD40 gene has been associated with several diseases such as:

- Hyper-IgM syndrome Type 3
- Common variable immunodeficiency
- Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
- Colorectal cancer
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

### Treatment and prognosis 
Targeting CD40 signaling has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Many CD40 agonist antibodies and vaccines are being developed and tested clinically. However, the efficacy and safety of these treatments are still under investigation. 

### Drug response 
Some drugs targeting CD40 receptor signaling are being tested in clinical trials. The list of drugs includes:

- Selicrelumab (CD40 agonist)
- APX005M (CD40 agonist)
- Lucatumumab (CD40 agonist)
- Dacetuzumab (CD40 agonist)
- ChiLob 7/4 (CD40 antagonist)
