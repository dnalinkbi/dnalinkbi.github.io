## Gene TRB

### Genetic Position

The TRB gene is located on human chromosome 7p14-p15 and spans a length of 620 kilobases.

### Pathology

The TRB gene is mainly associated with T cell receptor (TCR) gene recombination, which is critical for the development of T cells. Dysregulation of TRB gene expression or function can lead to various autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases.

### Function

The TRB gene encodes the beta chain of the TCR, which plays a crucial role in the recognition and response of T cells to foreign antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are various mutations reported for the TRB gene, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertion/deletion variants. Some of the common non-synonymous mutations in the TRB gene are:

- M98I (rs35947132)
- V102L (rs200988267)
- L114I (rs150081619)
- G118V (rs113994119)
- R125L (rs181634466)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported for the TRB gene in different types of cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and lung cancer, among others. Some of the common somatic mutations in the TRB gene are:

- T360N (rs782981545)
- F361L (rs1057519700)
- V370A (rs766632227)
- R385W (rs758319125)
- G395S (rs369245546)

### Related Disease

Dysregulation of TRB gene expression or function has been associated with various diseases, including:

- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
- DiGeorge syndrome
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Type 1 diabetes
- Asthma
- Allergic rhinitis

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for TRB-associated diseases, and treatment options mainly depend on the specific condition and severity of symptoms. For some cases of SCID, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be curative. In other cases, immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, can help alleviate symptoms.

### Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response related to TRB gene mutations.
