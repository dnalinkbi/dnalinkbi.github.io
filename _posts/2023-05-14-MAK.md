# Information about gene MAK

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic position**: MAK gene is located on chromosome 10q22.1.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in MAK gene have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa and microcephaly.
- **Function**: MAK gene encodes the protein kinase MAK, which is involved in regulating the activity of other proteins by adding phosphate groups to them. This protein is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of certain neuronal populations in the brain.

## Gene Information

- **Function for gene**: MAK encodes a protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of other proteins through phosphorylation.
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 8399

## Variations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - p.Gln71His (rs121908147)
    - p.Arg203His (rs121908148)
    - p.Thr423Ile (rs121908149)
    - p.Asp550Asn (rs727504729)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.
- **Related disease**: 
    - Retinitis pigmentosa
    - Microcephaly
- **Treatment and prognosis**: The treatment for retinitis pigmentosa and microcephaly caused by MAK mutations is limited to supportive measures. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition.
- **Drug response**: Information currently not available.
