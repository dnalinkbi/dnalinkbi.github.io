# Information about gene CLN3

**Genetic position:** Chr 16:28486823-28556822

**Pathology:** Mutations in CLN3 gene are associated with juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), also known as Batten disease - a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system.

**Function for gene:** The CLN3 gene encodes a transmembrane protein, which is believed to play a role in lysosomal function and intracellular trafficking.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
- Gene ID: 205
- HGNC ID: 2628
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000155642
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 205
- Genomic Location: Chr 16:28486823-28556822
- Aliases: JNCL, Batten_spg7

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg282Trp (rs80358587)
- p.Arg281Trp (rs121908757)
- p.Arg151Ter (rs80358588)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related disease:** Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Batten disease.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is no cure for JNCL, and treatment involves managing symptoms and providing supportive care. Prognosis is poor, with most individuals with JNCL not surviving beyond their 20s.

**Drug response:** There are currently no specific drugs approved for the treatment of JNCL. However, clinical trials are ongoing to investigate potential therapies.
