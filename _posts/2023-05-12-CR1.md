# Gene: CR1

## Genetic position:
The CR1 gene is located on chromosome 1 at position q32.2.

## Pathology:
Polymorphisms in the CR1 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to certain infections, such as malaria and bacterial meningitis. Additionally, CR1 mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.

## Function:
The CR1 gene encodes for the Complement Receptor 1 protein which functions as a membrane-bound complement regulator in the immune system.
