## Gene Information

### Gene Name: 
CHRND 

### Gene Function: 
The CHRND gene encodes for the subunit delta of the acetylcholine receptor, which is a membrane-bound receptor that binds to acetylcholine to open an ion channel, generating a chemical and electrical impulse necessary for muscle contraction.

### Genomic Location: 
The CHRND gene is located on chromosome 2q32.2.

### External IDs:

- OMIM: 100730
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07510

### Aliases: 
- ACHRD
