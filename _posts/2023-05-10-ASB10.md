# Gene ASB10

## Gene Function
The ASB10 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family, which function as substrate recognition components in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The protein encoded by ASB10 is believed to play a role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling and may be involved in cancer development.
