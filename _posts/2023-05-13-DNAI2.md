# Gene: DNAI2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: p11.2
- Strand: Minus strand
- GeneID: 64446

## Pathology
Mutations in the DNAI2 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare disorder characterized by respiratory tract infections, chronic lung disease, infertility, and situs inversus in some cases.

## Function
The DNAI2 gene encodes for a protein called axonemal dynein intermediate chain 2, which is involved in the movement of cilia and flagella by generating force and movement through ATP hydrolysis.

- NCBI Entrez: 64446
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109063
- OMIM: 606763

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- c.199G>A (p.Glu67Lys) rs17856742
- c.620G>A (p.Gly207Ser) rs121908665
- c.1015C>A (p.Thr339Lys) rs55829310

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for DNAI2 gene.

## Related Disease
- Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia

## Treatment and Prognosis
Unfortunately, there is no cure for PCD. The current treatment involves managing the symptoms and preventing infections with antibiotics. The prognosis of PCD varies from person to person and depends on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that targets the DNAI2 gene directly. The treatment for PCD usually involves antibiotics, bronchodilators, and in severe cases, lung transplantation.
