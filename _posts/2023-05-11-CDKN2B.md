## Gene CDKN2B

### Genetic Position
The gene CDKN2B is located on chromosome 9p21.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in the CDKN2B gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia.

### Function for Gene
The CDKN2B gene encodes the p15 protein, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a role in regulating the cell cycle.
