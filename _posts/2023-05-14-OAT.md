## Gene OAT

- **Function** : The OAT gene encodes for the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase, which is involved in the urea cycle. It catalyzes the conversion of ornithine and Î±-ketoglutarate to glutamate and proline.

- **External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location**:
    - Gene ID (HGNC): 8102 
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 4942 
    - Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000137679 
    - OMIM: 258870 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04181
    - Chromosomal location: 10q26.13

    - c.802G>A (p.Ala268Thr) (rs28839100)
    - All mutations are missense

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
    - No somatic mutations have been reported yet.

- **Related Disease**:
    - Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the OAT gene. It is characterized by elevated levels of ornithine, ammonia and homocitrulline in plasma and urine, as well as neurological symptoms.

- **Treatment and Prognosis**:
    - Management of HHH syndrome aims at reducing the levels of ammonia and ornithine in the body. This may include a low-protein diet, medications like sodium phenylbutyrate, and orthotopic liver transplantation in severe cases.
    - The prognosis for individuals with HHH syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms and early diagnosis and treatment can help improve outcomes.

- **Drug Response**:
    - Treatment with sodium phenylbutyrate has been shown to be effective in reducing ammonia and ornithine levels in individuals with HHH syndrome.
