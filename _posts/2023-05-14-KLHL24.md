## Information about Gene KLHL24

### Genetic Position
The gene KLHL24 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 26.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the KLHL24 gene have been associated with various types of cancer including lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. The exact mechanism by which KLHL24 contributes to cancer is not completely understood, but it is thought to be involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation.

### Function
The KLHL24 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the kelch-like family of proteins, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by KLHL24 is thought to play a role in regulating the degradation of specific target proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is also thought to be involved in the regulation of cilia structure and function.
