## Gene: CEBPE

### Function:
The CEBPE gene encodes for the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon, which is expressed in myeloid cells and plays a crucial role in regulating the differentiation of these cells.

### Genomic location:
The CEBPE gene is located on chromosome 14q11.2.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:
- HGNC:2406
- NCBI Entrez:1053
- Ensembl:ENSG00000100678
- OMIM:189965
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q15744

Aliases: C/EBP-epsilon, CEBP-epsilon, CRP1, IL6DBP, TCF5, and mXBP.


### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several mutations reported in the CEBPE gene. Some of them are listed below:
- p.G191R (rs137853963) - Missense mutation
- p.A266T (rs137853967) - Missense mutation
- p.R285C (rs137853968) - Missense mutation

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
Currently, there is no known somatic mutation in the CEBPE gene.

### Related disease:
The mutations in the CEBPE gene have been associated with specific subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including AML with maturation (AML-M2) and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Some studies have also suggested the involvement of CEBPE mutations in the pathogenesis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

### Treatment and prognosis:
The treatment of AML depends on several factors such as the subtype of leukemia, patient's age, overall health, and medical history. Some of the standard treatment options for AML include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, and targeted therapy. The prognosis of AML patients with CEBPE mutations varies depending on various factors; however, some studies have suggested that patients with CEBPE mutations may have a better prognosis compared to those without these mutations.

### Drug response:
Currently, there is no known targeted therapy available for AML patients with CEBPE mutations. However, several clinical trials are ongoing to develop novel treatment options for these patients.
