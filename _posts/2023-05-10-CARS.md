# Information about gene CARS

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11q13.1

## Pathology
CARS is associated with several diseases, such as colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and autism spectrum disorders.

## Function for gene 
The CARS gene encodes an enzyme called cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, which is responsible for attaching the amino acid cysteine to its corresponding tRNA molecule during protein synthesis.
