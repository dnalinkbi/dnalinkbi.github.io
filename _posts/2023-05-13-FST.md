# Gene FST

## Information about Gene FST

**Genetic position:** FST gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position 11.21, from base pair 72,622,923 to base pair 72,645,836.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the FST gene have not been associated with any disease. However, the deregulation of FST expression has been linked to the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including breast, liver, and lung cancer.

**Function:** FST (Follistatin) is a glycoprotein that binds to and neutralizes members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, such as activin and myostatin. FST increases skeletal muscle mass and enhances recovery from injury, and may have a potential therapeutic application in muscle wasting disorders.

**Aliases:** FST, follistatin, activin-binding protein

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 3974
- NCBI Entrez: 10468
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106368
- OMIM: 601374
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P19883

**AA mutation list:**

No amino acid mutations have been reported for the FST gene.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the FST gene.

**Related disease:** 

Aberrant regulation of FST is implicated in several types of cancer including breast, liver, and lung cancer.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

FST may have a potential therapeutic application in muscle wasting disorders as it has been shown to increase skeletal muscle mass and enhance recovery from injury.

**Drug response:**

There is no known drug response associated with the FST gene.
