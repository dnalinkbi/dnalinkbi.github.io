# Information about gene BRAF

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: p15.3

## Pathology
- BRAF is a proto-oncogene that when mutated can promote the development of cancer. The most common mutation in BRAF is a substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 600 (V600E). This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the BRAF protein, which can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor growth.

## Function
- BRAF encodes a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase that is involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This pathway is important for cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 1097
- NCBI Entrez: 673
- Ensembl: ENSG00000157764
- OMIM: 164757
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P15056

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- V600E: c.1799T>A (rs113488022)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.1798_1799delTGinsAA: rs121913530
- c.1798_1799delTGinsCA: rs121913529
- c.1798_1799delTGinsTA: rs121913528

## Related Disease
- BRAF mutations are commonly found in a variety of human cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, and thyroid cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma can be treated with BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib. However, resistance to these drugs often develops.
- Prognosis for BRAF-mutant cancer patients can vary depending on the specific tumor type and stage.

## Drug Response
- BRAF inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in treating BRAF-mutant melanoma.
- The effectiveness of BRAF inhibitors in other BRAF-mutant cancers is variable.
