# Gene GLI3

## Genetic Position

GLI3 is located on chromosome 7q36.2 [1].

## Pathology

GLI3 mutations have been associated with several human conditions, including Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), and postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA) [2].

## Function

GLI3 encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the GLI family of proteins. It plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for the normal development of many organs and tissues [3].

## External IDs

- Alias: GLI-Kruppel family member GLI3
- HGNC ID: HGNC:4264
- Entrez Gene ID: 2737
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000168958
- OMIM ID: 165240
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P10071

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Several AA mutations have been reported for the GLI3 gene. Some examples are:

- R252W (dbSNP: rs786200707), missense mutation
- N337K (dbSNP: rs794727811), missense mutation
- G223V (dbSNP: rs121912673), missense mutation

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the GLI3 gene, such as:

- rs745474577, substitution
- rs141511994, insertion
- rs767426772, deletion

## Related Disease

GLI3 is associated with several diseases, such as Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), and postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA). Some of the symptoms of these conditions may include craniofacial anomalies, limb abnormalities, and polydactyly [2].

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for individuals with GLI3-related conditions depend on the specific condition and severity of the symptoms. There is currently no cure for GLI3-related syndromes, and treatment is generally focused on managing the symptoms [4].

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on the drug response for GLI3-related conditions.
