## Gene: SHFM1

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q21.2)
- **Pathology:** SHFM1 stands for the Split-Hand/Foot Malformation Type 1, which is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by malformations of the hands and feet resulting in missing or fused digits.
- **Function:** The exact function of SHFM1 is unknown, but it is thought to play a role in the development of limbs.
- **Aliases:** ECTD5, LSP1P5
