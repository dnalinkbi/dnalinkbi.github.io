# Information about gene AGPS

## Genetic Position
The AGPS gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q31.1). It spans approximately 12.8kb and consists of 10 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in the AGPS gene have been associated with Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata Type 3 (RCDP3), a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects skeletal development. RCDP3 is characterized by shortening of the proximal bones, cataracts, and intellectual disability.

## Function 
The AGPS gene encodes the enzyme peroxisomal alkylglycerone phosphate synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens. Plasmalogens are a class of phospholipids that are essential for the proper function of organs and tissues, including the brain, heart, lungs, and eyes.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic mutations reported for the AGPS gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the AGPS gene are associated with Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata Type 3 (RCDP3).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for RCDP3, and treatment is primarily supportive. Prognosis for individuals with RCDP3 varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug therapy available for RCDP3.
