# Gene PDK4
### Information about genetic position, pathology, and function

**Genetic Position:** PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) is located on chromosome 7q21.3.

**Pathology:** Alterations in the PDK4 gene have been associated with several diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and cancer.

**Function:** The PDK4 gene encodes for a mitochondrial enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) which regulates glucose metabolism by inhibiting the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, leading to energy production. Inhibition of PDH activity by PDK results in the diversion of pyruvate from energy production to gluconeogenesis, which is a major contributor to hyperglycemia.

**Related Disease:** Alteration in PDK4 gene is associated with a number of diseases such as:
- Type 2 diabetes
- Obesity
- Metabolic syndrome
- Cancer

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no specific treatment for PDK4 gene alteration. Treatment of the associated diseases from PDK4 gene alteration is based on management of symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the associated disease.

**Drug Response:** There are no drugs currently available that specifically target PDK4 gene. Drugs used to manage associated diseases may be used.
