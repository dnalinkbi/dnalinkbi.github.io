# Gene: PCSK9

## Genetic Position 

The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) gene is located on chromosome 1 in humans, at the location 1p32.3. It is comprised of 12 exons and spans approximately 21 kb.

## Pathology 

Variants in the PCSK9 gene can lead to an increased plasma level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which can increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) and other cardiovascular diseases. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the PCSK9 gene have been associated with reduced LDL-C levels, which have been shown to decrease the risk for CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.

Moreover, there is evidence linking PCSK9 with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

## Function

The PCSK9 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in lipid homeostasis. It regulates cholesterol levels in the bloodstream by controlling the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR).

## External IDs and Aliases

External IDs for the PCSK9 gene include:

- HGNC: 8805
- NCBI Entrez: 255738
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169174
- OMIM: 607786
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NBP7

Aliases for the PCSK9 gene:

- FH3
- HCHOLA3

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some of the frequently observed nonsynonymous variants in PCSK9 are:

Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID
-----|-----|------ 
D374Y | Missense | rs505151
V114A | Missense | rs72646536
R46L | Missense | rs11591147

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

The somatic variants or mutations in PCSK9 with dbSNP ID are currently unknown.

## Related Disease

Variants/mutations in the PCSK9 gene have been associated with the following diseases:

- Familial hypercholesterolemia
- Coronary artery disease
- Alzheimer's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

There are several medications that treat elevated cholesterol levels, including PCSK9 inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies) such as evolocumab, which have been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C levels. PCSK9 inhibitors may benefit patients with an inherited high cholesterol disorder, known as familial hypercholesterolemia, and those with an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease.

## Drug Response

PCSK9 inhibitors can effectively lower LDL-C levels, which is a critical factor in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The response to PCSK9 inhibitors can vary depending on the patient and other factors, and a genetic test can identify patients who are most likely to respond to the medication.
