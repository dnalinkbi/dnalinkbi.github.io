## Gene Information

**Name:** IL1RL1

**Function for gene:** encodes a protein called interleukin-1 receptor-like 1, which acts as a receptor for the cytokines interleukin-33 (IL-33) and Interleukin-36 (IL-36)

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
- HGNC: 5991
- NCBI Entrez: 9173
- Ensembl: ENSG00000172057
- OMIM: 605066
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01638

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- No pathogenic mutations have been reported

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- No somatic mutations have been reported 

**Related disease:** 
- Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular disease

**Treatment and prognosis:**
- Targeted therapies to block IL1RL1 activity are being developed for asthma and COPD, but their efficacy in humans is not yet established 

**Drug response:**
- Preliminary studies suggest that blocking IL1RL1 may be a promising therapy for asthma and COPD
