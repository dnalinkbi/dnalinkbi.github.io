# Gene: SLC22A4

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 5
- Location: 5q31.3

## Pathology
SLC22A4 gene mutations have been found to be associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.

## Function
The SLC22A4 gene encodes a solute carrier family 22 member 4 protein, also known as the organic cation transporter 1 (OCTN1). This protein plays a critical role in the transport of organic cations across different tissues, including the intestine, kidney, liver, and brain.

## Related Disease
SLC22A4 mutations have been found to be associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including:
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Psoriasis

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases associated with SLC22A4 mutations. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms with medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic therapies.

## Drug Response
Studies have suggested that certain SLC22A4 gene polymorphisms may affect the response to some drugs, including:
- Metformin
- Imatinib
- Levofloxacin
