# Information about gene RPS4Y2

## Genetic Position
The gene RPS4Y2 is located on the Y chromosome at position Yp11.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in RPS4Y2 have been associated with infertility in men. The gene is essential for the normal development of sperm and any disruption in its function can result in infertility.

## Function
RPS4Y2 encodes for a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The protein plays a crucial role in the process of translation during protein synthesis.

- OMIM ID: 400005
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P08865
- Aliases: S4, S4Y

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid mutations have been identified in RPS4Y2.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations have been identified in RPS4Y2.

## Related Disease
- Infertility in men

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for infertility caused by mutations in RPS4Y2. However, fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can help affected men father a child.
- The prognosis for individuals with mutations in RPS4Y2 depends on the severity of the mutation and the success of fertility treatments.

## Drug Response
- There are currently no known drugs that specifically target RPS4Y2.
