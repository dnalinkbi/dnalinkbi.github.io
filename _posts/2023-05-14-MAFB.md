## Gene: MAFB

### Genetic position

The MAFB gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 at position 13.2 (20q13.2), spanning about 35.87 kilobases (kb).

### Pathology

Mutations or dysregulation of the MAFB gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria type 4 (OMIM #256860)
- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (OMIM #603278)
- Acute myeloid leukemia (OMIM #601312)

### Function

MAFB encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It specifically plays a crucial role in the development and function of various immune cells and the bone marrow.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Several missense mutations have been reported in the MAFB gene, leading to an amino acid change in the protein sequence:

| AA Change   | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID    |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| P39S        | Missense     | rs386834679 |
| P44L        | Missense     | rs397514572 |
| G57V        | Missense     | rs397514573 |
| A64T        | Missense     | rs794727340 |
| G70R        | Missense     | rs28936977  |
| R73C        | Missense     | rs749170208 |
| V85M        | Missense     | rs797045602 |
| R96Q        | Missense     | rs745212337 |
| L132S       | Missense     | rs768387280 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several MAFB mutations have also been reported as somatic variants in various tumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia and clear cell renal cell carcinoma:

| Variant Type | AA Change | dbSNP ID     |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Missense     | G72R      | rs769137424  |
| Missense     | D185N     | rs199696863  |
| Frameshift   | E36fs     | rs769137425  |
| Frameshift   | Y138*     | rs773020791  |
| Frameshift   | T207fs    | rs200566526  |

### Related disease

Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria type 4 is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules on the dorsal aspects of the hands, feet, and sometimes on the face and neck. It has been associated with mutations in the MAFB gene.

### Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria type 4, and treatment options are generally limited to managing the cosmetic appearance of the skin lesions.

### Drug response

There is little information available on drug response in relation to MAFB mutations.
