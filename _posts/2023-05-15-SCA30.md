## Gene SCA30

### Genetic Position
The gene SCA30 is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q34.3).

### Pathology
SCA30 (Spinocerebellar Ataxia 30) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of a repeated DNA sequence in the SCA30 gene. The expansion results in the production of a longer form of the protein product than normal, leading to the degeneration of nerve cells in the cerebellum, which controls balance and coordination.

### Function
The exact function of the SCA30 gene is not well understood, although it is believed to play a role in the regulation of transcription.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 22209

- Ensembl: ENSG00000170379
- OMIM: 615911
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H8U6
- Aliases: SCA30, SCAJB, spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal dominant 30

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations in the SCA30 gene associated with the disease, including:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L265P | Missense | rs398122804 |
| L349P | Missense | rs398122802 |
| I226M | Missense | rs398122803 |
| P308S | Missense | rs398122801 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information available on somatic SNVs/InDels in the SCA30 gene.

### Related Disease
Spinocerebellar Ataxia 30 (SCA30)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for SCA30, and treatment is currently focused on addressing symptoms such as balance and coordination issues. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response in individuals with SCA30.
