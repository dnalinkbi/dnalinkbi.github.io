# Gene GRM1

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** The GRM1 gene is located on chromosome 6q24.2.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the GRM1 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer.
- **Function:** The GRM1 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1, which is a protein involved in various physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity, neuronal excitability, and pain perception.

## External IDs and Aliases

- **External IDs:** HGNC: 4566; NCBI Entrez: 2911; Ensembl: ENSG00000124491; OMIM: 137163; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13255.
- **Aliases:** GPRC1A, MGLUR1, GRM1S1, GRM1S2, GRM1S3, GRM1S4.

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list:** Some of the missense mutations reported in the GRM1 gene are: R63H, C71G, R118H, A350V, and R565Q.
- **Mutation type and dbSNP ID:** These mutations are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), and their dbSNP IDs are: rs2229944, rs191464557, rs201315115, rs2229945, rs10510612.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
