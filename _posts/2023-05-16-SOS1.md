# Gene Name: SOS1

## Information Overview:

- **Gene Function:** The SOS1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell division and growth. It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Ras, which is an important signaling molecule that controls various cellular processes.

- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 6654
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 2q34
    - Aliases: hSos1, GGF1, GRF1, SOS

- **External Sites:**  
    - HGNC: 11108
    - NCBI Entrez: 6654
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000178904
    - OMIM: 182530
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q07889

- **Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:** All the above mentioned mutations are missense mutations, which cause a single amino acid substitution in the protein. The rsIDs for each mutation are indicated in parentheses.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** 
    - c.2034C>T (rs201586827)
    - c.395A>G (rs145093924) 
    - c.1453G>A (rs75972590)
    - c.1748T>G (rs2211403)

- **Related Diseases:** 
    - Noonan syndrome (NS)
    - Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC)
    - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)
    - Colorectal cancer
    - Lung adenocarcinoma
    - Breast cancer
    - Thyroid cancer

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for SOS1-related diseases depends on the specific condition and presenting symptoms. In some cases, surgery and targeted therapies may be recommended. 

- **Drug Response:** Several drugs, such as Trametinib and Cobimetinib, that target the Ras pathway have been approved for the treatment of melanoma and other cancers in patients with mutations in SOS1 and other related genes.
