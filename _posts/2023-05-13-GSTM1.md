# Gene GSTM1

## Information about gene GSTM1
The GSTM1 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p13.3. The function of GSTM1 gene is to encode an enzyme that belongs to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family. This enzyme is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and reactive intermediates by conjugating them with glutathione. The encoded protein plays a significant role in the metabolism of carcinogens as well as in the defense against oxidative stress.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in GSTM1 gene, among them are:
- rs1065411: C>T, causing Arg53Ter (stop-gained mutation) in exon 2
- rs72549392: G>A, leading to Val152Ile missense mutation in exon 4
- rs366630183: A>G, resulting in Lys210Arg missense mutation in exon 6
- rs72549393: T>C, producing Leu167Pro missense mutation in exon 4

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is a somatic mutation reported in GSTM1 gene in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database:
- COSM1346538: C>A, causing Glu20Lys missense mutation in exon 1 of stomach cancer

## Related disease
Genetic variations in GSTM1 gene have been associated with various diseases including:
- Cancer (lung, breast, prostate, bladder, etc.)
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Parkinson's disease
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Asthma
- Autism spectrum disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis
Prognosis and treatment involving GSTM1 gene are not well established. However, individuals with GSTM1 null genotype may have reduced ability to detoxify carcinogens, thus are at a higher risk of developing cancer. 

## Drug response
Individuals with GSTM1 null genotype may exhibit different drug responses compared to those with functional GSTM1 alleles. For instance, GSTM1 null individuals may have a higher risk of developing hematological toxicity when receiving chemotherapy with medications such as busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide.
