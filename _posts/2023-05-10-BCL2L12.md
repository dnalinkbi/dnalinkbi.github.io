# Information about Gene BCL2L12

## Genetic Position
The BCL2L12 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.33).

## Pathology
BCL2L12 is associated with various types of cancer, including bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been shown to be downregulated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues.

## Function
The BCL2L12 gene encodes for a protein that belongs to the BCL-2 family of proteins. The precise function of BCL2L12 is still not well understood, but it is believed to have a role in apoptosis and regulation of cell death.

- Bladder cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Hepatocellular carcinoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no targeted treatment specifically designed to treat cancer associated with BCL2L12 mutations. However, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are commonly used to treat various types of cancer, and these can also be used to treat cancers associated with BCL2L12 mutations.

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific information available about drug response and BCL2L12.
