## Gene GALNT9 

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 12
- Start Position:  123,343,243 bp
- End Position: 123,404,010 bp


### Pathology/Function
The GALNT9 gene encodes a member of the UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family. This enzyme catalyzes the initial reaction in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, which involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine and threonine residues. The specific function of the GALNT9 protein is not currently known.
