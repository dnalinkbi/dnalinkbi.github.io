# Gene: EPHB2

### Genomic location and Alias
- Genomic location: Chromosome 1q36.1
- Alias: Cek5, Drt, Elk-L, EphB-2, Erk, Htk, PCBC

### Function
EPHB2 gene encodes a member of the Eph receptor family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases which plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system and tumor suppression. It is involved in axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and angiogenesis. Its ligands are ephrins which are also transmembrane proteins.

### Related disease
- Prostate cancer: Studies have shown that EPHB2 has tumor suppressor activity and its down-regulation is associated with prostate cancer initiation and progression. [PMID: 28128965]
- Colorectal cancer: Inactivating mutations in the EPHB2 gene increase the risk of colorectal cancer. [PMID: 27863264]

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, no specific treatment is available for conditions associated with EPHB2 mutations. However, studies are ongoing to investigate the potential of EPHB2 as a therapeutic target. The prognosis for conditions associated with EPHB2 mutations varies depending on the specific condition and severity of the mutation.

### Drug response
There are no drugs currently approved specifically for the treatment of EPHB2-related conditions. However, some studies have shown that certain drugs targeting ephrins, the ligands for EPHB2, may have potential in the treatment of cancer. [PMID: 28801929]
