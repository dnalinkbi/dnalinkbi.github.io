# Information about Gene TRAF7

## Gene Position and Pathology

**TRAF7** is located on the **chromosome 6p21.1** and is associated with various diseases including **schwannomatosis**, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple non-cancerous tumors called schwannomas on the cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves.

## Gene Function

The TRAF7 gene encodes for the **TNF receptor-associated factor 7** protein, which plays a vital role in the **NF-κB signaling pathway**. It is involved in regulating various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cytokine production, and immune response.

**Aliases:** RNF79, RNF85, TRAF-7, RING finger protein 79, RING finger protein 85.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Various missense mutations have been identified in the TRAF7 gene associated with schwannomatosis. Here are some examples:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Arg429Cys | Missense | rs587781291 |
| p.Cys437Phe | Missense | rs1557524829 |
| p.Thr487Ser | Missense | rs1557525417 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Some somatic mutations have also been reported in the TRAF7 gene. Here are some examples:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.1189A>G | Missense | rs145514758 |
| c.1438G>A | Missense | rs372777853 |
| c.1576C>T | Missense | rs1550355726 |

## Related Disease

The TRAF7 gene is associated with schwannomatosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple non-cancerous tumors called schwannomas on the cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for schwannomatosis. Treatment options include surgery to remove tumors and pain management therapies. The prognosis varies depending on the severity and location of the tumors.

## Drug Response

There is limited information on drug response related to TRAF7 mutations.
