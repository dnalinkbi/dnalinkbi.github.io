## Gene Information

**Gene symbol:** PTPN12

**Gene Name:** Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 12

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q11.23)

**Aliases:** PTP-PEST, PTP-BAS, PTPN18

## Function for Gene

PTPN12 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that regulates signal transduction through dephosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and other signaling molecules. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of several cellular functions including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion.
