# Gene: LUM

## Genetic Position
LUM (Lumican) is located on chromosome 12p21.3.

## Pathology and Function
LUM encodes for a protein called lumican, which is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. The protein is predominantly expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a variety of tissues, including cornea, bone, cartilage, and skin. Lumican plays a role in the regulation of collagen fibril assembly and modulation of cell behavior.
