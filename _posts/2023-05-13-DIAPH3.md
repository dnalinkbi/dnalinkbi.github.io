# Information about gene DIAPH3

## Genetic Position
DIAPH3 is a gene located on human chromosome 13q14.3. 

## Pathology and Function
The DIAPH3 gene encodes the protein Diaphanous-related formin-3, which is involved in actin filament assembly and regulation of cell shape. This protein plays a role in important cellular processes such as cell migration, cell polarity, and cytokinesis.
