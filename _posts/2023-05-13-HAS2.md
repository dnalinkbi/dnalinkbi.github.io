# Gene Information for HAS2

### Gene Function
The HAS2 gene encodes for an enzyme called hyaluronan synthase 2, which is necessary for the synthesis of hyaluronan (HA). HA is an important component of the extracellular matrix and is involved in various biological processes, including tissue architecture, cell proliferation, and cell migration.
