## Gene: DNAL1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Start position: 69,289,530 bp
- End position: 69,312,812 bp

### Function
DNAL1 encodes dynein light chain 1, which is one of the two non-catalytic subunits of the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein transports various cellular cargoes along microtubules toward their minus-end.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 29178
- NCBI Entrez: 26057
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106620
- OMIM: 607701
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N688

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Asn361Ser (missense), rs138207269
- p.Asn545Ser (missense), rs138190358
- p.Asp674Asn (missense), rs140594904

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations reported for DNAL1 in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
DNAL1 has been found to be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for PCD is symptomatic management, including respiratory treatments and antibiotics for lung infections. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and any associated complications.

### Drug Response
There are no known drug response or targeted therapy options for DNAL1-related disease at this time.
