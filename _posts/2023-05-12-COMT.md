# Gene: COMT

## Function
The COMT gene encodes for the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase which degrades catecholamines such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the brain and periphery. 

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: 2185
- NCBI Entrez ID: 1312
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000100043
- Genomic location: 22q11.21
- Aliases: FLJ25179, HEL-S-98n

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- rs4680 (Val158Met)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported.

## Related Disease
The COMT gene variation has been associated with various diseases such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis implications of the COMT gene variation depend on the associated disease. There is ongoing research to develop COMT inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

## Drug Response
Individuals with certain variations in the COMT gene have been shown to respond differently to various drugs such as opioids and antipsychotics.
