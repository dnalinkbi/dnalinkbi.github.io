# Information about Gene CREBBP

## Genetic Position
- Gene: CREBBP
- Chromosome: 16
- Location: p13.3
- Strand:  Plus strand (forward orientation)

## Pathology
- CREBBP gene mutations are associated with genetic disorders, including Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) and some types of leukemia and lymphoma.

## Function
- CREBBP gene encodes a protein called CREB-binding protein, which is involved in regulating the transcription of DNA and the expression of genes. 
- This protein interacts with a variety of transcription factors and coactivators and is involved in the acetylation of histones, which is necessary for proper gene expression and regulation.

## Related Disease
- Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS)
- Lymphoma
- Leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). Treatment usually involves managing individual symptoms and providing supportive care. 
- The prognosis for individuals with RSTS varies widely depending on the severity of their symptoms and associated health problems.

## Drug Response
- Currently, there are no known drugs that specifically target CREBBP gene mutations associated with RSTS or other related diseases.
