## Gene ATM

- **Function:** The ATM gene encodes for a protein kinase that is involved in DNA damage response, cell cycle checkpoint control, and apoptosis. It plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by detecting and repairing DNA damage.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC: 795
    - NCBI Entrez: 472
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000149311
    - OMIM: 607585
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13315

- **Aliases:** ataxia telangiectasia mutated, TEL1, ATA, ATDC, ATE, ATD, AT1

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.7271T>G (p.Leu2424Arg) - rs121434268
    - c.8192G>A (p.Asp2731Asn) - rs397507426
    - c.8471_8473delTTC (p.Phe2824del) - rs368543906
    - c.8809C>T (p.Arg2943Cys) - rs113994171
    - c.9124A>G (p.Ter3042TrpfsTer3) - rs72549383

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.7271T>G - rs121434268
    - c.8809C>T - rs113994171
    - c.9124A>G - rs72549383

- **Related Disease:** Ataxia Telangiectasia, Breast Cancer, T Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia, B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Mantle Cell Lymphoma

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options for diseases associated with ATM mutations vary depending on the specific disease and its severity. Some treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplants. The prognosis for individuals with ATM mutations also varies depending on the specific disease.

- **Drug Response:** PARP inhibitors have shown efficacy in treatment of some cancers with ATM mutations.
