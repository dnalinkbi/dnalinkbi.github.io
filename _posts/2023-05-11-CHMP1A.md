## Gene Information

**Gene name:** CHMP1A (charged multivesicular body protein 1A)

**Function:** CHMP1A belongs to the chromatin modifying protein/charged multivesicular body protein family and is involved in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, which facilitates sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation.

**Aliases:** Chromosome-associated MVB protein, CHMP1, VPS46A

**Genomic location:** Chromosome 16p13.3


**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 19250
- NCBI Entrez: 5119
- Ensembl: ENSG00000140718
- OMIM: 610052
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15198


**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several reported missense mutations in CHMP1A, including:

- E62K (rs187166594)
- R123L (rs1050133)
- D189V (rs3741173)

All of these mutations are listed as "benign" or "likely benign" in dbSNP.


**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

A search on COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) did not show any reported somatic SNVs or InDels in CHMP1A.


**Related disease:**

Mutations in CHMP1A have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8 (PCH8), a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized by progressive microcephaly, spasticity, seizures, and developmental delay.


**Treatment and prognosis:**

There is no cure for PCH8 and treatment is mainly supportive, focusing on managing symptoms such as seizures and spasticity. Prognosis can vary widely depending on the severity of the disease.


**Drug response:**

There is currently no known targeted treatment for PCH8.
