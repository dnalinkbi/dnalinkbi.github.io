# Gene Information for DMPK

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- DMPK gene is located on the q28 band of chromosome 19 and it is involved in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy.
- Myotonic dystrophy is caused by an abnormal expansion of the trinucleotide CTG repeats in the 3' UTR of DMPK.

## Function
- DMPK gene codes for the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase which is a serine-threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes including spermatogenesis, muscle differentiation, and cardiac function.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 1760
- Genomic location: 19q13.32
- HGNC: 2920
- NCBI Entrez: 1760
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100181
- OMIM: 605377
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q09013
- Aliases: DM, DM1, DM2, DMKG, MT-PK, MTDPS1

## Mutation Information
- AA Mutation List: DMPK p.Gln950Pro (dbSNP ID: rs104893942)
- Mutation Type: Missense
- Note: This mutation causes type 1 myotonic dystrophy.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: None reported.

## Related Diseases
- Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1
- Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for myotonic dystrophy; however, treatment is focused on managing the symptoms.
- Prognosis for patients with myotonic dystrophy varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- At present, there are no targeted treatments for myotonic dystrophy.
- Several drugs, including mexiletine and ranolazine, are in clinical trials for their potential to alleviate muscle symptoms in patients with myotonic dystrophy.
