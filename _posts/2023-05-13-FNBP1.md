# Information on Gene FNBP1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
  - Gene: FNBP1
  - Chromosome Location: 9q33.1
  - Pathology: FNBP1 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility, and cell adhesion. Mutations in FNBP1 have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders.
  - Function: FNBP1, also known as formin binding protein 1, is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics through binding to formin proteins. It also interacts with other proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, including integrins and PTP-PEST.
