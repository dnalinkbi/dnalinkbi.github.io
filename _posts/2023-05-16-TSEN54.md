## Information about gene TSEN54
### Genetic Position
TSEN54 is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 17q25.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in TSEN54 are associated with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2A (PCH2A), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the development of the cerebellum and brainstem.

### Function for Gene
TSEN54 encodes a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease, which is involved in the maturation of transfer RNA molecules in eukaryotes.

### External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
- HGNC ID: 26023
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 80781
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000172060
- OMIM ID: 606266
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q7Z5Q4
- Aliases: FLJ24869, HSA238776, Nbla00303

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala307Val (rs780791024)
- p.Leu419Pro (rs1175365180)

Both mutations are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic variants for TSEN54.

### Related Disease
Mutations in TSEN54 are associated with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2A (PCH2A), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the development of the cerebellum and brainstem.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for PCH2A. Treatment is typically supportive and focused on managing symptoms, which may include epilepsy, spasticity, and feeding difficulties. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
There are no known drugs specifically targeting TSEN54 mutations or PCH2A.
