# Information about Gene CYP2C19

## Genetic Position
The CYP2C19 gene is located on chromosome 10q24.1.

## Pathology
The CYP2C19 gene is associated with the metabolism of various drugs including antiplatelet agents, proton-pump inhibitors, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene can lead to altered drug metabolism which may result in variable drug efficacy or toxicity.

## Function
The CYP2C19 gene encodes for the cytochrome P450 2C19 enzyme which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs in the body.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the CYP2C19 gene.

## Related Disease
CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been associated with variable drug response and toxicity in various diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and psychiatric disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Knowledge of a patient's CYP2C19 genotype can aid in personalized drug therapy to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Prognosis will depend on the specific disease and factors beyond the CYP2C19 gene.

## Drug Response
CYP2C19 polymorphisms can lead to altered drug metabolism and variable drug response. For example, poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 substrates such as clopidogrel have an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared to extensive metabolizers.
