# Information on Gene CUBN

## Genetic Position
The gene CUBN (Cubilin) is located on chromosome 10q23.2, spanning 316.73 kb genomic region, from 93,838,985 bp to 94,155,706 bp.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CUBN gene are known to cause megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1) disorder. MGA1 is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects vitamin B12 absorption. 

## Function for Gene
The CUBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called cubilin. Cubilin is found in several organs, including the kidneys and intestines, where it plays a crucial role in the absorption of several vitamins and proteins from the bloodstream. Cubilin helps in the reabsorption of filtered proteins in the kidneys.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/Indels found in the CUBN gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CUBN gene are associated with megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1) disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for MGA1 usually involves lifelong vitamin B12 injections. Prognosis may vary based on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is no reported drug response associated with CUBN gene mutations.
