# Analyzing Gene ALDH3A2

## Gene information
The gene ALDH3A2 is located on chromosome 17 at position 17p11.2. It encodes for the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2.

### Function
The ALDH3A2 enzyme plays a role in the detoxification of aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation in cell membranes. It also contributes to the oxidation of certain drugs and xenobiotics.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 398
- NCBI Entrez: 224
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109072
- OMIM: 600501 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51648
- Aliases: ALDH6A1, FALDH, SLS, SLS/ALDH

### Mutations
#### AA mutations with dbSNP ID
- R413P (rs118204986)
- L339P (rs137853513)
- V61X (rs61733574)
- R139X (rs180177079)

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.727C>T (rs146908006)
- c.1047G>A (rs587776829)

### Related Diseases
Defective ALDH3A2 enzyme activity is associated with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin abnormalities, intellectual disability, and spastic diplegia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, and treatment is primarily symptomatic. Affected individuals require a multidisciplinary approach to manage the various aspects of the disorder, such as skin care, physical therapy, and educational interventions.

### Drug Response
Individuals with ALDH3A2 mutations may have altered drug metabolism and response, particularly for drugs that are metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes.
