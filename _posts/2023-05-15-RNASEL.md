## Gene Information on RNASEL

### Genetic Position and Pathology

RNASEL is a human gene located on chromosome 1 at the position 1q25. Heterozygous or homozygous variations in this gene are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. It is an autosomal dominant gene. 

### Function

RNASEL (ribonuclease L) functions as a key regulator of the innate immune system. It plays a role in the antiviral and antitumor response of the body. The RNASEL protein acts as an endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded RNA. It also helps in the initiation of protein synthesis and apoptosis.

### External IDs and Aliases

- Externally, RNASEL is identified through various IDs such as:
    - HGNC: 10406
    - NCBI Entrez: 6041
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000120907
    - OMIM: 180435
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q05823

- RNASEL gene is also known by various aliases such as:
    - HPC1 
    - RNS4
    - LocusID: 6041

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- c.206G>A: p.Gly69Arg, rs12757945
- c.498C>G: p.Pro166Arg, rs56155426

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- rs5030655 (somatic mutation)
- rs5030656 (somatic mutation)
- rs17859576 (somatic mutation)

### Related Disease

- Prostate Cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no single proven treatment for prostate cancer caused by RNASEL mutations. However, patients with mutations are known to respond positively to chemotherapy treatment. The prognosis of prostate cancer caused by RNASEL mutations depends on the extent of cancer spread, and the individual patient's medical history, among other factors. 

### Drug Response

Patients with prostate cancer caused by RNASEL mutations might respond to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and Cisplatin.
