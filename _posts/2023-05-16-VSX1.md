# Gene VSX1

## Information

**Pathology:** Mutations in gene VSX1 have been associated with various ocular disorders, including keratoconus and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.

**Function:** This gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a critical role in eye development. It is involved in regulating the differentiation of retinal photoreceptor cells and is essential for proper formation of the cornea.

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 20: 41,482,478 - 41,526,111 bp

**Aliases:** RINX, CORD12

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 12884 
- NCBI Entrez: 30813 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000149290 
- OMIM: 605020

- Corneal Dystrophy, Fuchs Endothelial, 6

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for keratoconus, but available treatments can improve vision and prevent the condition from worsening. These treatments include contact lenses, corneal cross-linking, and in severe cases, corneal transplantation.

## Drug Response

There are currently no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of keratoconus. However, several medications, such as eye drops and oral supplements, have been explored as potential treatments, but their efficacy remains unproven.
