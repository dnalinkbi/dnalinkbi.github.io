### Information about Gene IGSF1

#### Genetic Position
IGSF1 gene is located on chromosome Xq25-q26 and spans around 475 kb genomic region. It consists of 20 exons and encodes for Immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 protein.

#### Function for gene
IGSF1 protein plays an important role in the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from pituitary cells. It acts as a binding partner for the TSH receptor and regulates its activation.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in IGSF1 gene.

#### Related Diseases
Mutations in IGSF1 gene can cause central hypothyroidism, an inherited disorder characterized by the deficiency of thyroid hormone. It can lead to various complications like intellectual disability, short stature, delayed puberty, and metabolic disorders.

#### Treatment and prognosis
The treatment of central hypothyroidism includes a lifelong hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. The prognosis of the disease depends upon the severity of the condition and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.

#### Drug response
There are no reported drug responses associated with IGSF1 gene.
