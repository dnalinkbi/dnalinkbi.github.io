## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** MPDU1

**Pathology:** MPDU1 gene is associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type 1f (CDG1F), which is a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal protein glycosylation. 

### Function for gene
MPDU1 gene encodes a protein called mannose-P-dolichol utilization defect 1 (MPDU1) which plays an important role in the transport of proteins across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Specifically, MPDU1 helps in transporting mannose-P-dolichol, an essential molecule for protein glycosylation, from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum.

- Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy with Early-onset Paget disease (IBMPFD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for CDG1F. Treatment options include nutritional support, physical therapy, and management of symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder. 

### Drug Response
There is no known specific drug treatment for CDG1F. However, some therapeutic strategies such as mannose supplementation, could represent an innovative therapeutic option.
