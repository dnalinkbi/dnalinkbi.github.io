## Gene CD177

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 19q13.42

**Function for gene:** The CD177 gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is expressed by a subset of human neutrophils. Its function is not fully understood, but it is thought to play a role in neutrophil migration and adhesion.

**Aliases:** NB1, HNA-2a
