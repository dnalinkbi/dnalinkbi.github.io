# Gene NOD2

## Information

**Gene Name:** NOD2  
**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 16q12.1  
**Aliases:** CARD15, IBD1, CLR16.3  
**External IDs:** HGNC: 7207, NCBI Entrez: 64127, Ensembl: ENSG00000167207, OMIM: 605956, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HC29  

## Function

NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2) is an intracellular receptor that recognizes bacterial peptidoglycan fragments. It plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by activating the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines. 

## Mutations

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- R702W (rs2066847): missense mutation, substitutions from arginine to tryptophan at amino acid position 702
- G908R (rs2066844): missense mutation, substitutions from glycine to arginine at amino acid position 908
- L1007fs (rs2066845): frameshift mutation, a cytosine insertion at position 3020 in the NOD2 coding sequence, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon 7 amino acids downstream  

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are various somatic SNVs/InDels in NOD2, but no specific mutations with dbSNP ID have been reported.

## Pathology

Mutations in NOD2 have been associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD), Blau syndrome, and early-onset sarcoidosis. The R702W, G908R, and L1007fs mutations are the most common NOD2 mutations associated with CD. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for inflammatory bowel diseases such as CD, but various treatments can help manage symptoms and maintain remission. Treatment options include anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies. The prognosis for CD varies depending on the severity and location of the disease, but most people with CD can lead a relatively normal life with proper treatment. 

## Drug Response

NOD2 mutations can affect the response to certain drugs used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies. Some studies have shown that NOD2 mutations are associated with a lower response to anti-TNF therapy and a higher risk of adverse events.
