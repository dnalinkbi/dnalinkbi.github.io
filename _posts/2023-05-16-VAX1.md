## Gene VAX1

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 10: 68,242,203-68,249,253

**Pathology:** VAX1 mutations have been associated with abnormal eye development, including microphthalmia, coloboma, and anophthalmia.

**Function for gene:** The VAX1 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in eye development and specification of the ventral midbrain.

**Related diseases:** Abnormal eye development, including microphthalmia, coloboma, and anophthalmia.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment options may include corrective surgery for vision and supportive care for associated developmental disabilities. Prognosis can vary based on the severity of the eye abnormalities and any associated developmental disabilities.

**Drug response:** There is currently no specific drug designed for VAX1 mutations. Treatment options are aimed at managing the symptoms associated with the eye abnormalities and developmental disabilities.
