# Gene GIPR

## Genetic Position
Gene GIPR is located on chromosome 19q13.32.

## Pathology
GIPR is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mutations in GIPR have been shown to lead to altered insulin secretion and glucose tolerance.

## Function for gene
GIPR encodes the GIP receptor, which plays a role in glucose homeostasis by regulating insulin secretion and promoting fat deposition.
