# Information about Gene BBS12

## Gene Position
Gene BBS12 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 4 at position 27.3.

## Pathology
BBS12 is associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, renal anomalies, learning difficulties, and hypogonadism.

## Function
BBS12 is involved in cilia function and intracellular transport. It plays a crucial role in ciliary protein trafficking and is required for proper cilia maintenance.

None reported

## Related Disease
Bardet-Biedl Syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for BBS, but treatment is focused on managing the specific symptoms of the disease. Patients require multidisciplinary care involving ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, and nephrologists. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of clinical manifestations in each patient.

## Drug Response
Unknown
