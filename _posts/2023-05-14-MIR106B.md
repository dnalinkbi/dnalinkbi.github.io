# Information on gene MIR106B

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q22.1)

**Pathology:** Research has shown that the MIR106B gene and its miRNA products may play roles in various diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases.

**Function:** MIR106B, also known as miR-106b-25 cluster, encodes for three microRNAs; mir-106b, mir-93 and mir25. These miRNAs are involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 31490
- NCBI Entrez: 407024
- Ensembl: ENSG00000231181
- OMIM: 610528
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: NA

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported amino acid mutations for MIR106B as it encodes for non-coding miRNAs.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for MIR106B.

**Related Disease:** MIR106B has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer (lung, pancreatic, breast, and gastric), Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The association between MIR106B and disease suggests it may serve as a potential therapeutic target. However, further research is necessary to determine its effectiveness in treatment and predict its prognosis.

**Drug Response:** There is no reported drug response for MIR106B.
