## Gene UBR7

### Genetic position:

Gene UBR7 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q23.2), from base pair 79,679,247 to 79,718,979.

### Pathology:

Currently, there is no known specific pathology associated with variants in UBR7 gene.

### Function:

The UBR7 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which is involved in protein degradation and tagging molecules for destruction. It appears to play a critical role in regulating multiple cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, signal transduction pathways, and DNA damage response.
