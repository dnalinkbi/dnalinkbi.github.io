## Gene TWIST1

TWIST1 is a well-known gene involved in embryonic development, specifically in craniofacial and limb development. It encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in mesoderm-derived tissue formation. Several studies have suggested that the TWIST1 gene is involved in human cancers such as breast, prostate, and liver cancer.

### Function

TWIST1 functions as a transcriptional repressor or activator by binding to the E-box motif of target genes. It plays a role in the development and differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, which include bone, cartilage, blood vessels, and adipose tissue.

### External IDs

- Gene ID: 7291
- Genomic location: Chromosome 7:19,403,903-19,582,991
- Aliases: ACS3, BPES2, CRS, CSO, SCS, TWIST

### AA mutation list with mutation type

There are several mutations in the TWIST1 gene, including missense mutations, synonymous mutations, frameshifts, and splice site mutations.

Here is a list of some of the most common mutations in the TWIST1 gene:

- 180G>A (p.A60T), rs104894419: missense mutation
- 482C>T (p.Q161X), rs121909050: nonsense mutation
- 430C>T (p.R144X), rs121909051: nonsense mutation

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

Here is a list of some of the most common somatic SNVs/InDels in the TWIST1 gene:

- 346C>T (p.R116C), rs201889683: missense mutation in breast cancer
- 476G>A (p.R159H), rs6873545: missense mutation in prostate cancer
- 346C>G (p.R116G), rs199859725: missense mutation in gastric cancer

### Related diseases

Mutations in the TWIST1 gene have been associated with a variety of diseases, including:

- Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome (SCS): This is a genetic disorder that affects the head, face, and limbs. Mutations in the TWIST1 gene are responsible for about half of all cases of SCS.
- Craniosynostosis: This is a condition in which the bones in an infant's skull fuse together too early. TWIST1 mutations are associated with some forms of craniosynostosis.

### Treatment and prognosis

There is no specific treatment for TWIST1 gene mutations. Treatment is usually focused on managing the symptoms associated with the associated conditions, such as craniofacial anomalies. Prognosis varies depending on the specific condition associated with the mutation.

### Drug response

There is currently no evidence to suggest that TWIST1 mutations are predictive of drug response.
