## Gene Information for SFTPB

### Genetic Position
SFTPB (Surfactant protein B) is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 at position 11.2.

### Pathology
Variations in the SFTPB gene have been associated with different forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature babies, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 

### Function
SFTPB encodes for a protein called pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B), which is essential for normal lung function. SP-B plays a crucial role in stabilizing the air-liquid interface of the alveoli in the lungs, which prevents their collapse during breathing.

### Related Disease
Variations in the SFTPB gene have been associated with different forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature babies, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for individuals with the SFTPB variations typically involves supportive care, such as oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and steroids. Prognosis varies based on the severity of the lung disease and the individual's response to treatment.

### Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of SFTPB gene variations.
