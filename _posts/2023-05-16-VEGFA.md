# Gene: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA)

## Pathology

VEGFA is a gene that encodes for the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A protein, which is a glycoprotein that promotes the formation of new blood vessels and the growth of existing ones. VEGFA plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, during embryonic development and in adult tissues.

Aberrant expression of VEGFA can lead to the development and progression of various diseases including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and ischemic heart disease.

## Function

VEGFA regulates the formation of blood vessels by stimulating angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. It also enhances vascular permeability and promotes the survival of endothelial cells.

## Genetic Information

### AA mutations and mutation types with dbSNP IDs

VEGFA has various amino acid (AA) mutations that have been associated with different diseases. Some of these include:

AA mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID | Disease
--- | --- | --- | ---
p.Ala206Val | Missense | rs3025039 | Coronary Artery Disease
p.Ser217Phe | Missense | rs1137261 | Increased risk of developing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
p.Asn318Asp | Missense | rs2010963 | Retinal Vein Occlusion

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Some somatic mutations in VEGFA have been identified in various cancers. Some of these include:

Mutation type | dbSNP ID | Cancer type
--- | --- | ---
Missense | rs833061 | Renal Cell Carcinoma
Frameshift | rs116909374 | Gastric Cancer

## Related Diseases

Some of the diseases that are related to VEGFA include:

- Cancer
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- Ischemic Heart Disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

Therapeutic agents targeting VEGFA such as Bevacizumab, Aflibercept, and Ramucirumab have been used for the treatment of various cancers and ocular diseases. However, these drugs can have side effects such as hypertension, proteinuria, and increased risk of bleeding.

## Drug Response

Common VEGFA variants such as rs699947 and rs2010963 have been associated with drug response to VEGF-targeted therapies in cancer.
