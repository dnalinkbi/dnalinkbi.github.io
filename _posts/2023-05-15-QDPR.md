# Information about Gene QDPR

## Genetic Position
The QDPR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q31.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in the QDPR gene can cause a rare metabolic disorder called hyperphenylalaninemia, which results in elevated levels of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. This condition can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems if left untreated.

## Function
The QDPR gene encodes an enzyme called dihydropteridine reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. This enzyme also helps to recycle an important cofactor for several other enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism.

## Related Disease
- Hyperphenylalaninemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for hyperphenylalaninemia caused by QDPR mutations typically involves dietary restriction of phenylalanine and supplementation with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor that dihydropteridine reductase helps to recycle. With appropriate treatment, many individuals with this condition can lead normal lives.

## Drug Response
Several drugs are used to treat different forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, including sapropterin dihydrochloride, which can improve BH4 synthesis and recycling. However, not all patients respond equally well to these treatments, and the optimal regimen may vary depending on the specific genetic cause of the condition.
