# Gene GPT

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 8 (8q24.2)
- **Pathology:** GPT gene mutations have been associated with a variety of diseases such as liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis.
- **Function of Gene:** The GPT gene encodes the enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT), which plays a key role in amino acid metabolism by catalyzing the reversible transamination between alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate to produce pyruvate and glutamate.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location

## Related Diseases
- Liver disease
- Primary biliary cirrhosis
- Chronic hepatitis

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for GPT-related diseases is dependent on the specific disease and its severity. Supportive care and medication may be used to slow the progression of liver disease and improve liver function.

## Drug Response
According to some studies, individuals with certain GPT gene variants may have altered drug response to some medications, such as methotrexate.
