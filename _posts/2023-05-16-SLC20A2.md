## Gene: SLC20A2

### Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 8 (8p11.21)
- **Pathology:** Genetic mutations in SLC20A2 have been linked to idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), a rare neurological disorder characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium in the basal ganglia. 
- **Function:** SLC20A2 encodes a protein that acts as a sodium-phosphate cotransporter involved in the regulation of mineralization of bones and teeth. 

### Gene ID and Genomic Location
- **Gene ID:** 10866
- **Aliases:** PiT-2, MGC13502, BMND1 
- **Genomic Location:** NC_000008.11 (63641689..63983032)

### Related Disease
- Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification (IBGC)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for IBGC, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms.
- The prognosis for individuals with IBGC varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and any associated conditions.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug treatment for IBGC, and treatment is based on managing symptoms.
