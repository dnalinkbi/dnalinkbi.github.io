# Gene Information for PIGV

## Gene Position

Gene: PIGV\
Chromosome: 1\
Location: 1p36.22\
Strand: minus

## Pathology and Function

PIGV encodes for Phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class V protein. The protein encoded by PIGV gene functions in the first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis, which is an important pathway for membrane protein anchoring in eukaryotic cells. Loss-of-function mutations in PIGV have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ij (CDG-Ij), which is characterized by abnormal neurological development, seizures, hypotonia, and delayed psychomotor development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels were found with dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease

CDG-Ij is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in PIGV gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for CDG-Ij. Treatment options include symptomatic management of seizures, infection, and other complications associated with the disorder. The prognosis for patients with CDG-Ij is poor, with the majority of affected individuals experiencing severe developmental delays and neurological impairment.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information on drug responses for PIGV mutations.
