## Gene Information

Gene Name: CCT5

### Function

CCT5 encodes a subunit of the chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, also known as TCP1 Ring Complex (TRiC). This complex is involved in folding and assembly of proteins. CCT5 plays a role in ensuring the correct folding of proteins by the CCT complex.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported for CCT5 with dbSNP ID.

### Related Disease

Mutations in CCT5 have been associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organs including the eyes, kidneys, and central nervous system.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and treatment of symptoms is typically supportive and may include medications, surgery, and/or other interventions. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the individual's symptoms.

### Drug Response

There is no information available currently on drug response for CCT5.
