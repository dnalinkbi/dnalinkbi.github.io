# Gene CRYGEP

## Genetic Position

The gene CRYGEP is located on chromosome 2 at position 2q33.3.

## Pathology

Mutations in the CRYGEP gene have been associated with congenital cataracts. 

## Function

The CRYGEP gene encodes a protein that is a member of the crystallin family, which forms a major component of the lens in the eye. Crystallins play a key role in maintaining lens transparency and clarity.

- NCBI Entrez: 1406
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163044
- OMIM: 123680
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P22914

Aliases: CRYGP, CRYGP1, CRYGP2, CRYGP2_1, CRYGP2_2, CRYGS, MGC9361

## AA Mutation List

AA mutations in this gene have been reported in primary congenital glaucoma, a condition that may occur as a result of mutations in CRYGEP. Some of the reported AA mutations and their mutation types, along with dbSNP IDs, are listed below:

- p.Arg62Gly (Missense), rs121908089
- p.Arg62His (Missense), rs121908090

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the CRYGEP gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CRYGEP gene have been associated with congenital cataracts, a clouding of the lens in the eye that is present at birth or develops in early childhood.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for congenital cataracts typically involves surgical removal of the cloudy lens and replacement with an artificial lens. Prognosis for this condition is generally good, although visual outcome may vary depending on the severity of the cataract and any underlying conditions.

## Drug Response

There is currently limited information on drug response associated with mutations in CRYGEP.
