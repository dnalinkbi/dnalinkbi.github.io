# Gene: HLA-DQB1

## Genomic location

The HLA-DQB1 gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3, in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II region.

## Pathology

HLA-DQB1 is associated with various autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and multiple sclerosis. It has also been linked to infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C.

## Function

The HLA-DQB1 gene codes for the beta chain of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule, which presents antigens to T cells and plays a crucial role in the immune response.

## Related disease

HLA-DQB1 is associated with the following diseases:

- Type 1 diabetes
- Celiac disease
- Multiple sclerosis
- HIV/AIDS
- Hepatitis B and C

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with HLA-DQB1 can vary widely.

## Drug response

HLA-DQB1 can affect the response to certain drugs, particularly those that are metabolized by the liver or excreted by the kidneys. For example, certain variants of HLA-DQB1 can increase the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug abacavir.
