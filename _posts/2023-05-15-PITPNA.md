# Gene PITPNA

**Function:** The PITPNA gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, which plays an important role in the phosphoinositide metabolism and intracellular signaling pathways. It is involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, lipid homeostasis, and membrane fusion.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 9069
- NCBI Entrez: 5305
- Ensembl: ENSG00000118402
- OMIM: 600385
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P48745

**Aliases:** PITPN, PITPNC, MGC8794, FLJ32276

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** No pathogenic mutations have been reported in the PITPNA gene to date.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic mutations in PITPNA reported in various cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma in the TCGA database. However, there are no known dbSNP IDs for these mutations.

**Related disease:** There is no direct association of PITPNA mutations with any disease.

**Treatment and prognosis:** As there are no known PITPNA mutations linked to any diseases so far, there is no specific treatment or prognosis information available.

**Drug response:** There is no drug specifically targetting PITPNA.
