# Information about Gene SLC4A1

## Genetic Position
Gene SLC4A1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17q21.31).

## Pathology
SLC4A1 is associated with genetic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis, distal renal tubular acidosis, and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.

## Function for Gene
The SLC4A1 gene encodes for the Band 3 anion exchange protein, which is responsible for transporting bicarbonate ions across the red blood cell (RBC) membrane. This transport is necessary to regulate the intracellular pH of RBC and to maintain proper oxygen delivery to the body's tissues.

## Related Disease
SLC4A1 mutations are associated with conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, distal renal tubular acidosis, and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of SLC4A1-associated diseases includes interventions such as blood transfusions, splenectomy, and medication. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to SLC4A1 mutations.
