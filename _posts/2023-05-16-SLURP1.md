# Information about gene SLURP1

## Genetic Position
The SLURP1 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 8 at position 21.1.

## Pathology
SLURP1 gene mutations have been associated with mal de Meleda, a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by hyperkeratosis and erythema in the palms and soles.

## Function
The SLURP1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It functions as a ligand for α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in keratinocytes, regulating their differentiation and proliferation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations for the SLURP1 gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mal de Meleda is a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder caused by mutations in the SLURP1 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for mal de Meleda, but treatment is based on managing symptoms. Patients may benefit from therapy aimed at reducing hyperkeratosis and erythema, such as oral retinoids, topical corticosteroids, and keratolytic agents. The prognosis is variable and depends on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specific to mutations in the SLURP1 gene.
