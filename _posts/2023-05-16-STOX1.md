## Gene: STOX1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 10
- Genomic Position: 46,231,287 - 46,267,373

### Pathology and Function
- STOX1 (Storkhead-box protein 1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in trophoblast differentiation and placental development.
- Mutations in STOX1 have been linked to preeclampsia, a serious complication during pregnancy that can lead to maternal and fetal mortality. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC:30632, NCBI Entrez: 387332, Ensembl: ENSG00000197605, OMIM: 609376, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9ULC3
- Aliases: STO, ZNF386C, ZNF929

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.154C>G (p.P52A) rs115819529
- c.631A>G (p.N211S) rs149662880
- c.640G>A (p.R214Q) rs34963746

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic mutations in STOX1

### Related Disease
- Preeclampsia

### Treatment and Prognosis
- The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not fully understood, and no targeted therapies are currently available to treat the disease. 
- In severe cases, delivery of the fetus is the most effective treatment. 

### Drug Response
- No known drug response information for STOX1
