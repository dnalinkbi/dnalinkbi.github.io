# Gene SYP

**Genetic position**: Chromosome 19q13.12

**Pathology**: SYP gene is usually overexpressed in melanoma and other cancers and promotes tumorigenesis and tumor growth.

**Function**: The SYP gene encodes for synaptophysin, a protein that is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release.

**External IDs and Aliases**:
- HGNC ID: 11409
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 6855
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000105383
- OMIM ID: 313440
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P08247

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
- No pathogenic AA mutations have been identified in the SYP gene.
- Several non-pathogenic AA variants have been identified with dbSNP IDs: rs16939784, rs2229264, rs4641953, rs146729174, rs118550652.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
- Several somatic mutations have been identified in the SYP gene in melanoma and other cancers, with dbSNP IDs: rs1135405492, rs1075997853, rs1185515537, rs1054323074.

**Related disease**: Increased expression of the SYP gene has been observed in several cancers including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung carcinoma.

**Treatment and prognosis**: Targeting SYP gene expression or its downstream signaling pathways may be a potential therapeutic intervention for cancers with overexpression of SYP.

**Drug response**: Currently, no drugs specifically targeting SYP gene expression or its downstream signaling pathways are available.
