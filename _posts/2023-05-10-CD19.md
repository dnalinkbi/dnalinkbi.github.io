## Gene: CD19

### Genetic Position

CD19 gene is located on chromosome 16p11.2 and spans approximately 27.4 kilobases.

### Pathology

CD19 gene mutations/inactivations have been linked with various pathologies such as autoimmune diseases, leukemia, and lymphoma.

### Function

The CD19 protein is a B-cell-specific marker that is expressed from the early stage of B-cell differentiation until its terminal differentiation into plasma cells. CD19 functions as a co-receptor for B-cell receptor (BCR) and enhances signaling via the BCR. It also plays a role in B-cell activation and differentiation.

### Related Disease

CD19 mutations/inactivations have been associated with various diseases including:
- Common variable immunodeficiency 3 (CVID3)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

### Treatment and Prognosis

Patients with CD19-associated cancers can be treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that targets the CD19 protein. The prognosis varies depending on the type and stage of cancer and the response to treatment.

### Drug Response

There is evidence that CD19-targeted therapies such as CAR T-cell therapy can induce durable remissions in certain types of B-cell malignancies.
