## Gene Information
**Gene**: MAPK10

**External IDs**: HGNC: 6850, NCBI Entrez: 5600, Ensembl: ENSG00000107643, OMIM: 602896, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P53779

**Aliases**: JNK3, JNK-3, p493F12 kinase

**Genomic Location**: Chromosome 4q21.21

## Function
MAPK10 encodes for a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, specifically c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3). This protein plays a vital role in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
*There are several AA mutations present in MAPK10 gene, listed below are some of the significant ones.*
- V27I (rs1043226)
- T44A (rs11556655)
- A59T (rs11556653)
- I187V (rs34531278)
- V200G (rs2832407)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations have been reported in the MAPK10 gene, some of which are:
- A112T (rs121912679)
- I238T (rs55830735)
- Q287P (rs142386651)
- E337D (rs147926959)
- G391V (rs372287061)

## Related Disease
MAPK10 has been found to play a crucial role in cancer progression, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and others. Hence it is associated with tumorigenesis, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting MAPK10 could be a potential approach to developing anti-cancer therapies. The inhibition of JNK3 in cancer therapy may promote cancer cell death or sensitize cells to other therapies. The overexpression and also the downregulation of MAPK10 has been associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients.

## Drug Response
Some studies have reported the use of SP600125, a selective JNK inhibitor, for cancer treatment. The drug has shown promising results in inhibiting MAPK10 activity and cancer cell growth.
