## Gene Information: GGCX

### Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2q11.2

### Function
- The GGCX gene encodes the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational modification of vitamin K-dependent proteins by adding a carboxyl group to glutamate residues. This enables the proteins to bind calcium and function properly.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 4268
- NCBI Entrez: 2678
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116044
- OMIM: 137167
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P38435

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.552G>A (p.Arg184Gln) rs1801158
- c.1231C>T (p.Arg411Cys) rs12714145

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported in dbSNP

### Related Disease
- Bleeding disorder due to GGCX deficiency
- Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for bleeding disorder due to GGCX deficiency includes clotting factor concentrates, such as prothrombin complex concentrates, which contain carboxylated clotting factors, and vitamin K supplementation to increase carboxylation.
- Prognosis is dependent on the severity of the disease and prompt treatment.

### Drug Response
None reported in the literature
