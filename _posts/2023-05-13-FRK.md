# Gene FRK

FRK is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 6. The gene is responsible for encoding the protein tyrosine kinase FRK. The FRK protein plays a role in mediating the cellular response to external signals including growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. 

## Function:

The FRK gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase enzyme that is a member of the src family of kinases. The protein contains a SH2 and SH3 domain as well as a protein kinase domain. The function of this protein is not well understood, but it may play a role in cell growth and differentiation, and in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion.
