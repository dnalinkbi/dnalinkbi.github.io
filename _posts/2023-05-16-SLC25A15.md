## Gene: SLC25A15

### Genetic Position
SLC25A15 is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q14.2).

### Pathology and Function
SLC25A15 encodes a calcium-dependent mitochondrial solute carrier protein. This protein is primarily involved in transporting ornithine across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is an essential step in the urea cycle. Mutations in SLC25A15 can cause hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by high levels of ornithine, ammonia, and homocitrulline in the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations for SLC25A15 in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
Mutations in SLC25A15 are associated with hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by high levels of ornithine, ammonia, and homocitrulline in the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms usually develop in childhood and can include developmental delay, seizures, and liver dysfunction.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for HHH syndrome; however, treatment can involve a low-protein diet to reduce ammonia production, medication to manage seizures, and liver transplantation for severe liver dysfunction. Prognosis varies between patients and is largely dependent on the severity of the symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug developed for the treatment of HHH syndrome. However, medications such as valproic acid, phenobarbital, and meldonium have been shown to improve the symptoms associated with HHH syndrome.
