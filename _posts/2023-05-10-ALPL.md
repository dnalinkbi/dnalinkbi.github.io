# Information about Gene ALPL

## Genetic Position
The gene ALPL (alkaline phosphatase, liver/bone/kidney) is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.12. It spans a genomic region of about 53.9 kb and contains 12 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in ALPL gene have been associated with hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective bone and teeth mineralization. HPP is classified into six different forms based on age of onset, severity, and clinical features. Loss-of-function mutations in ALPL lead to reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, which impairs mineralization, causing rickets, osteomalacia, and dental abnormalities.

## Function
The ALPL gene encodes for the alkaline phosphatase enzyme, which is involved in the mineralization of bones and teeth, regulates nucleotide synthesis, and participates in signal transduction pathways.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several missense, nonsense, splice site, frameshift, and deletion mutations have been reported for ALPL gene. Here are some examples of mutations with their dbSNP ID:

- c.984+1G>A (rs121918606)
- c.1559G>A (p.Arg520His) (rs121918607)
- c.787C>T (p.Gln263Ter) (rs137853808)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are some somatic mutations reported in ALPL gene from various cancers such as breast, liver, prostate, and lung. Here are some examples of somatic mutations with their dbSNP ID:

- c.758C>T (p.Thr253Met) (rs879253524)
- c.1513C>T (p.Thr505Ile) (rs1057519632)
- c.1285G>A (p.Gly429Arg) (rs786204937)

## Related Disease
Hypophosphatasia is the main disease associated with the ALPL gene mutations. However, it has also been implicated in other bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, and bone fractures.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific cure for hypophosphatasia. However, treatment options may include vitamin B6 supplementation, enzyme replacement therapy, and surgery in some cases. Prognosis of HPP varies based on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
Enzyme replacement therapy with asfotase alfa has shown promising results in the treatment of infantile and juvenile forms of HPP. However, its efficacy on adult HPP is still under investigation.
