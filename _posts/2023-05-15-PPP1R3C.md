# Gene PPP1R3C
PPP1R3C is a gene that encodes for a protein called protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism.

## Function for gene
PPP1R3C is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism by regulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1, which plays a key role in glycogen synthesis, degradation, and regulation.
