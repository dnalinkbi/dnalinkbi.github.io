# Information About Gene FABP2

## Genetic Position
The FABP2 gene, also known as fatty acid-binding protein 2, is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 4q28-q31.

## Pathology and Function
The FABP2 gene plays a vital role in facilitating the absorption and transport of long-chain fatty acids in the intestine. Additionally, it is involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Mutations in this gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

- rs483352853
- rs558464086
- rs150345280

## Related Disease
Mutations in the FABP2 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, oral medications, and insulin therapy. The prognosis for individuals with type 2 diabetes can vary, but with proper management, it is possible to prevent or delay complications.

## Drug Response
There is ongoing research exploring how different medications may affect individuals with mutations in the FABP2 gene. Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeted towards FABP2.
