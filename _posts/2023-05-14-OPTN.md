# Genetic Information Analysis Report: Gene OPTN

## Overview
Here is an analysis report for gene OPTN, which includes information on its genetic position, pathology, and function.

## Function for gene
The OPTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called optineurin. This protein plays a role in several cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammation, cell division, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Optineurin also helps to transport certain molecules within cells.
