# Information about Gene PGM1

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 1
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): chr1:153,273,796-153,321,076
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh37): chr1:154,070,231-154,117,416

## Pathology and Function
- PGM1 (Phosphoglucomutase 1) gene encodes an enzyme called phosphoglucomutase. This enzyme is involved in glycogen metabolism and glucose homeostasis. 
- Mutations in the PGM1 gene can cause glycogen storage disease, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal buildup of glycogen in the body.
- PGM1 is also involved in the regulation of tumor cell metabolism and the Warburg effect, which is a phenomenon characterized by the increased uptake of glucose by tumor cells.
- Function for gene: catalyzes the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate.

## Related Disease
- Glycogen storage disease type XIV (GSD14)
- Neuromuscular disease with glycogen storage
- Hepatic glycogenosis with fasting hypoglycemia
- Congenital non-hemolytic jaundice

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for glycogen storage disease varies depending on the specific type and severity of the disease. It may involve dietary modifications to manage glucose levels, medications to manage symptoms, or enzyme replacement therapy.
- Prognosis also varies depending on the type and severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
- No known drug response information is available for PGM1.
