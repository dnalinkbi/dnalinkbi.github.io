# Gene Information

## Gene Name and Alias
- Gene Name: VPS13A (vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog A)
- Alias: CHAC, KIAA0534, VARP (VPS9-ankyrin repeat protein)

## Gene Function
- VPS13A belongs to the VPS13 family of proteins involved in membrane trafficking, organelle biogenesis, and autophagy.
- It plays a role in regulating Golgi structure and vesicular trafficking.
- The protein is involved in lipid metabolism and storage, as well as lysosome function.

## Genomic Location and External IDs
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1, 198,153,599 â€“ 198,568,168 bp
- HGNC ID: 12757
- NCBI Gene ID: 23230
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000084545
- OMIM ID: 606897
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q96LD8

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.3378C>T (p.Arg1126Trp); dbSNP ID: rs1553197359
- c.7478C>T (p.Arg2493Ter); dbSNP ID: rs201909214
- c.2479C>T (p.Arg827Ter); dbSNP ID: rs1561420055

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.7658G>C (p.Gly2553Ala); dbSNP ID: rs767048164
- c.11130C>T (p.Arg3710Cys); dbSNP ID: rs773389666
- c.11378T>G (p.Met3793Arg); dbSNP ID: rs202169909

## Related Disease
- VPS13A mutations have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc).
- ChAc is a progressive disease characterized by the degeneration of the basal ganglia in the brain, leading to a movement disorder that involves chorea, dystonia, and dysarthria.
- Other symptoms include the characteristic acanthocytes in the blood, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for ChAc, and treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive.
- Medications can be used to control movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures.
- Prognosis is poor, with most patients eventually losing the ability to walk and becoming wheelchair-bound.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information on drug response in ChAc, but some studies have suggested that certain medications might have a beneficial effect on movement disorders.
- Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, has been shown to be effective in some patients.
- Other drugs that have been used in ChAc include tetrabenazine, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.
