## Gene CDK7 

### Genetic Position
CDK7 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 7) is located on chromosome 5q12.1. 

### Pathology
Aberrant expression and dysregulation of CDK7 have been found in multiple human cancers and diseases. 

### Function
CDK7 is part of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex that phosphorylates and activates CDKs such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, which regulate the cell cycle. CDK7 also regulates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, leading to the initiation of transcriptional elongation.

### Related Disease
Diseases associated with CDK7 include breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and Cockayne syndrome.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Targeted therapies involving CDK7 are currently being studied as potential treatments for cancer. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and individual factors. 

### Drug Response
Studies have shown that CDK7 inhibitors, such as THZ1, have antitumor effects in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer and melanoma.
