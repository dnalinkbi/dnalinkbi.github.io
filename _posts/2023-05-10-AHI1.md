## Information about Gene AHI1

### Genetic Position
AHI1 (Abelson helper integration site 1) is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q23. The gene spans approximately 840 kb of genomic DNA and has 30 exons.

### Pathology and Function
AHI1 gene is associated with various neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and Joubert syndrome. This gene plays a significant role in the development and function of the brain, particularly in the formation of the cerebellum. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 349
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 54806
- Ensembl: ENSG00000118402
- OMIM: 608894
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8BGZ3

Aliases: Jouberin, Abelson helper integration site-1 protein, Abelson helper integration site-1-like protein

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some of the reported non-synonymous mutations in the AHI1 gene causing various neurological disorders are:
- R2204X (stop gain), rs121434260
- E2412K (missense), rs121434259
- R821X (stop gain), rs121434258
- T306M (missense), rs121434257

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Not available

### Related Disease
- Joubert Syndrome
- Schizophrenia
- Autism Spectrum Disorder

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for genetic mutations in AHI1. Treatment options vary depending on the symptoms and can include medications to manage seizures, therapy to treat behavioral or developmental issues, and surgery for any structural abnormalities in the brain. The prognosis is variable and depends on the severity of the disease.
