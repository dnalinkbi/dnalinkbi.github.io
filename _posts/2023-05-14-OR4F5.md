# Gene: OR4F5

## Genetic position
The gene OR4F5 is located on the chromosome 11 at the position 11q23.3.

## Pathology
OR4F5 is associated with anosmia, which is the loss of the sense of smell.

## Function
OR4F5 encodes for olfactory receptor protein. Olfactory receptors are responsible for the recognition of odorants which is done via G-protein coupled receptors in the nose.
