# Information about gene SYNPO

## Genetic Position
The SYNPO gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q11.2). It spans approximately 116.4 kb and consists of 19 exons.

## Pathology
The SYNPO gene has been associated with several pathologies including dilated cardiomyopathy(DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM), and heart failure.

## Function
The SYNPO gene encodes for synaptopodin, a protein that is mainly expressed in the podocytes of the kidney and cardiac muscle cells. Synaptopodin has been shown to regulate actin dynamics and stabilize actin filaments in podocytes. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the heart.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The following are some of the reported amino acid mutations in the SYNPO gene:

| Amino Acid Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R9C | Missense | rs372961930 |
| R98X | Nonsense | rs267607876 |
| R109G | Missense | rs201364391 |
| Q634E | Missense | rs201991489 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no reported somatic mutations in the SYNPO gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SYNPO gene have been implicated in the following diseases:
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1R (CMD1R)
- Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (FHC)
- Heart Failure

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treatment usually involves symptom management with the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics. End-stage heart failure may require the use of heart transplant or mechanical circulatory support devices.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response specifically related to SYNPO mutations.
