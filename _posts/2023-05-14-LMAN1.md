## Gene Information

### Gene LMAN1

LMAN1 (Lectin, Mannose-Binding 1) is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) that performs as a cargo receptor in the secretory pathway. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in quality control in protein sensoring assembly and transportation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. It serves as a mannose-specific lectin that recognizes and transports glycoproteins with high mannose glycan content from the ER to the Golgi complex.

### External IDs and Location

- External IDs: HGNC:6540, NCBI Entrez: 3992, Ensembl: ENSG00000131069, OMIM: 604559, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H253
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 18q21.31

### Protein Function

The protein encoded by the LMAN1 gene is involved in the quality control of protein sensing assembly and transportation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. The protein works as a mannose-specific lectin, it recognizes and transports glycoproteins with high mannose glycan content from the ER to the Golgi complex

Mutations in LMAN1 gene have been found to be associated with the following diseases:

- Endochondral Hyperostosis, Autosomal Recessive (OMIM: 600785)
- Factor XI Deficiency (OMIM: 612416)

### Treatment and Prognosis

As of now, no particular treatment measures are available exclusively for LMAN1 mutations. The treatment mainly focuses on managing the symptoms exhibited by the patient. The prognosis of individuals would depend on the type and severity of the disease and the response towards the treatment.  

### Drug Response

No drug responses have been reported to LMAN1 gene mutations.

**Instructions:**
To get the required information for a gene, I have followed these steps:
1. The gene name and aliases were searched in the HGNC database ([Click](https://www.genenames.org/))
2. To determine the genomic location of the gene, I searched the NCBI Entrez database ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/))
3. To gather information about the codon/amino acid variations, I searched for the gene in dbSNP database ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp))
4. To find information about related diseases, I searched the OMIM database ([Click](https://www.omim.org/))
5. To obtain information on protein function and drug response, I searched the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database ([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/)) and PubMed ([Click](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).)
