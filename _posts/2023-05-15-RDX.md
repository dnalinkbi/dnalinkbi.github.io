## Gene: RDX

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 5
- Location: 5q23.3

### Pathology
- RDX has been found to be involved in the development and progression of several types of cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. In lung cancer, it has been shown to play a role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

### Function
- RDX encodes radixin, which is a cytoskeletal protein that interacts with actin and is involved in cell motility, adhesion, and structure.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 9999
- Entrez Gene: 5962
- Ensembl: ENSG00000113141
- OMIM: 179410
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35241
- Aliases: HRC, HEL-205, MST083, RDX1, LMA2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala106Val (rs41282544)
- p.Leu261Ile (rs141601577)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.288G>A (rs368433677)
- c.484A>G (rs150099620)

### Related Disease
- Lung Cancer
- Breast cancer
- Colorectal cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment or prognosis associated with RDX mutations or dysregulation, but targeting the protein may be a potential therapeutic approach for cancer.

### Drug Response
- There is currently insufficient information available on drug response related to RDX.
