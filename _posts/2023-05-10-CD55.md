# Gene Information for CD55

**Gene:** CD55

**Function:** The CD55 gene is involved in protecting cells from attacks by the immune system, particularly complement-mediated attacks. It codes for the protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which is a complement regulatory protein that prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that can damage cell membranes.

**External IDs/Aliases:**

- HGNC: 1654
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 1604
- Ensembl: ENSG00000007312
- OMIM: 125240
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08174

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1, 207,514,678-207,609,815

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

- c.358A>G (p.Thr120Ala) - rs33977775
- c.1024_1030del (p.Ile342fs) - rs786200439

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- c.512G>A (p.Gly171Ser) - rs572490630

**Related Diseases:** 

- Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** 

Treatment options for CD55-related complications, such as in HUS and PNH, include complement blockade therapies, such as eculizumab and ravulizumab, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and individual response to treatment.

**Drug Response:** 

Eculizumab and ravulizumab are FDA-approved complement inhibitors for the treatment of HUS and PNH. Both drugs act on the terminal complement pathway by blocking the cleavage of C5 and the formation of the MAC, ultimately protecting red blood cells from hemolysis.
