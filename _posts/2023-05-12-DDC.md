## Gene DDC

### Information about the gene

- **Function:** The DDC gene encodes for an enzyme called aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which is responsible for the production of neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. 
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 1644
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 7p11.2
    - Aliases: AADC, DOPA decarboxylase, DDCS 

### Mutations in gene 

- **AA mutation list and mutation type:** 
    - p.Asn471Ser, missense mutation
    - p.Arg347Ter, nonsense mutation
- **dbSNP IDs for AA mutations:** 
    - rs121918581
    - rs773194064
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported 

### Related diseases

- Segawa syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and tremors.
- AADC deficiency, a genetic disorder in which the body cannot produce enough dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine, leading to developmental delays and movement disorders.

### Treatment and prognosis

- There is currently no cure for AADC deficiency or Segawa syndrome, but symptoms can be managed with medications like dopamine agonists and levodopa.
- Early diagnosis and treatment can help improve the long-term prognosis for individuals with these disorders.

### Drug response

- Some drugs have been developed to specifically target the AADC enzyme, such as AAV-AADC gene therapy. 
- However, these treatments are still considered experimental and are not widely available.
