# Information on Gene HBG2

## Genetic Position
- Gene: HBG2
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 11
- Locus: 11p15.4

## Pathology and Function
- HBG2 is a member of the human beta-globin gene family and encodes for the beta-globin chain of fetal hemoglobin.
- Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is typically expressed during development and can provide protection against diseases such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.
- Mutations in HBG2 have been associated with several genetic disorders, including hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) and sickle cell anemia.

- NCBI Entrez: 3047
- OMIM: 142250
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P69891
- Aliases: HBF-2, HBFG2

## Mutation Information
- AA Mutation list: p.Gly16Asp, p.Ala17Thr, p.Gly16Arg, p.Ala17Ser, p.Ala17Asp, p.Gly16Ser
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs7482144, rs7482145, rs11886868, rs7482146, rs7482147, rs11886870

## Related Disease
- Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH)
- Sickle cell anemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment depends on the specific condition associated with HBG2 mutations.
- In general, treatment for sickle cell anemia may involve blood transfusions, medications to prevent complications, and bone marrow or stem cell transplants.
- The prognosis for individuals with HBG2 mutations can vary widely, but early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes.

## Drug Response
- There is ongoing research to develop novel therapies for sickle cell anemia that take advantage of HbF induction.
- Certain medications, such as hydroxyurea, have been shown to increase HbF levels in individuals with sickle cell disease.
