# Gene BRCA1

## Genetic Position

The BRCA1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at position 21.

## Pathology

Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

## Function

The BRCA1 gene encodes a protein that plays a role in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, and maintenance of genomic stability.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

People with mutations in the BRCA1 gene may choose to undergo preventive measures such as prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy to reduce their risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Regular surveillance and early detection are also recommended. The overall prognosis for people with BRCA1-related cancers is generally worse compared to those without these mutations.

## Drug Response

PARP inhibitors have shown to be effective in treating BRCA1/2-mutated cancers.
