# Information about gene STAT6

## Gene Information

- **Gene Name:** STAT6 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 6)
- **Gene Function:** STAT6 encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response. It acts downstream of cytokine receptors and is involved in the differentiation of Th2 cells, which are important in allergic responses and defense against extracellular parasites. 
- **Aliases:** D12S1644, IL-4-STAT

## Genomic Location and External IDs

- **Chromosome:** 12
- **Genomic Location:** 12q13.3
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:11364
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 6778
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000113721
- **OMIM ID:** 601512
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P42226

## Mutations and Polymorphisms

- **AA Mutation List:** A list of all amino acid mutations can be found on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot website ([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P42226#mutations).)
- **Mutation Types:** There are various types of mutations documented on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot website including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and more.
- **dbSNP IDs:** Some of the most documented dbSNP IDs can be found on the NCBI dbSNP website, idenifying specific SNPs associated with different diseases ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs3213789,) [Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs3024944).)

## Related Diseases

- **Disease:** Asthma
- **Description:** Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by obstruction of the airways. STAT6 has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma due to its involvement in Th2 cell differentiation and cytokine signaling. Several genetic studies have associated STAT6 variants with asthma susceptibility and exacerbation.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment:** The use of small molecule inhibitors targeting STAT6 signaling is being investigated as a potential therapeutic approach for asthma. 
- **Prognosis:** Further research is needed to fully understand the role of STAT6 in asthma pathogenesis and to improve treatment options for patients.

## Drug Response

- **Drug Response:** A study has shown that targeting STAT6 using a small molecule inhibitor could reduce airway hyperresponsiveness in a mouse model of asthma ([Click](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0102063).)
