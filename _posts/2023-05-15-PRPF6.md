## Gene Information on PRPF6

### Genetic Position

- PRPF6 gene is located on chromosome 20q13.33 in humans.

### Pathology

- Mutations in PRPF6 have been associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a genetic disorder that causes progressive vision loss.

### Function

- The PRPF6 gene encodes a protein called Pre-mRNA-processing factor 6, which is involved in RNA splicing, a process that removes non-coding introns from pre-mRNA to form mature mRNA that can be translated into protein.
- PRPF6 is also involved in the assembly and function of spliceosomes, the large molecular complexes that carry out RNA splicing in eukaryotic cells.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- There are several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been identified in the PRPF6 gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.
- Some of the common SNPs in PRPF6 include rs2243660 (Lys87Arg), rs2243659 (Ala231Thr), and rs2243658 (Val336Ala).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There is limited information on somatic mutations in PRPF6.

### Related Disease

- Mutations in PRPF6 have been associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a genetic disorder that leads to progressive vision loss.
- Other diseases associated with mutations in genes that function in RNA splicing include various forms of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for RP, but there are treatments that can help slow or manage the progression of the disease.
- The efficacy of the treatments depends on the specific mutation in PRPF6 and other factors that contribute to the disease.

### Drug Response

- There is limited information on drug response related to PRPF6 mutations.
