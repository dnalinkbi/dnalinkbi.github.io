# Information about Gene XPC

## Genetic Position
The XPC gene is located on chromosome 3 at position 25.1.

## Pathology
The XPC gene encodes a protein called xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC), which is involved in DNA repair. Mutations in the XPC gene are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV rays and a high risk of developing skin cancer.

## Function for Gene
The XPC protein plays a crucial role in the initial step of DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER), which involves detecting and binding to DNA damage caused by UV radiation and other environmental factors.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Here are some of the reported AA mutations in the XPC gene along with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|----|----|----|
|Gln939Ter|nonsense|rs137853966|
|Gln49Lys|missense|rs28929474|
|Glu225Lys|missense|rs35508098|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are various somatic SNVs/InDels in the XPC gene with their corresponding dbSNP IDs such as:

- rs35369398
- rs2244959
- rs34768571

## Related Disease
The XPC gene is associated with various diseases including:

- Xeroderma Pigmentosum
- Trichothiodystrophy
- Squamous cell carcinoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with Xeroderma Pigmentosum require strict sun protection to minimize their exposure to UV radiation in order to decrease the risk of skin cancer. If skin cancer occurs, surgery and radiation therapy are common treatments. The prognosis of Xeroderma Pigmentosum depends on the severity of the symptoms and the extent of cancer development.

## Drug Response
Studies have investigated the drug response of XPC in certain cancers such as melanoma, but no specific drug has been approved for the treatment of XPC mutations.
