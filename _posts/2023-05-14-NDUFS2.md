# Information about gene NDUFS2

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

**Gene Position:** NDUFS2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q12.2).

**Pathology:** NDUFS2 is associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (MC1D), which is a genetic condition characterized by malfunction of mitochondrial complex I leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. 

**Function for Gene:** NDUFS2 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene plays an important role in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain.

## Identifiers and Aliases

**Gene ID:** NDUFS2

**Genomic Location:** Chr18q12.2

**Aliases:** CI-39k, PSST, B18, CI-B18
