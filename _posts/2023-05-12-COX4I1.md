## Gene: COX4I1

### Genetic Position:
The COX4I1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.1).

### Pathology:
Mutations in the COX4I1 gene have been linked to mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and Mitochondrial Complex IV Deficiency.

### Function:
The COX4I1 gene encodes a protein known as cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1. This protein is a component of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is responsible for the final step in the electron transport chain, allowing for the generation of ATP.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 2221
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 1338
- Ensembl: ENSG00000140926
- OMIM: 123870
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13073
- Aliases: COX4, COXIV-1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Ala43Thr (rs121912562)
- p.Thr60Ile (rs74315329)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.93A>G (rs1076698595)

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the COX4I1 gene have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome and Mitochondrial Complex IV Deficiency.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for mitochondrial diseases, and treatment is generally supportive. Prognosis varies widely depending on the specific diagnosis and severity of the disease.

### Drug Response:
There is currently no known targeted drug therapy for mitochondrial diseases caused by COX4I1 mutations.
