## Gene LEFTY2 

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 1: 155,974,806-155,986,030 

**Pathology:** No known role in any disease 

### Function

The LEFTY2 gene encodes a secreted protein that belongs to the TGF-beta family of proteins. It plays an important role in embryonic development by regulating the differentiation of stem cells and the patterning of various tissues. LEFTY2 acts as an inhibitor of the NODAL signaling pathway, which is involved in the formation of the anterior-posterior axis in early embryogenesis.
