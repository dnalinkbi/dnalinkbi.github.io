# Information about Gene ATP2A2

## Genetic Position
The ATP2A2 gene, also known as the SERCA2 gene, is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.11).

## Pathology
Mutations in the ATP2A2 gene can lead to a variety of diseases, including:
- Darier disease, an autosomal dominant skin disorder
- Acrokeratosis verruciformis, a rare skin condition 
- Hailey-Hailey disease, a rare autosomal dominant skin condition

## Function
The ATP2A2 gene encodes a calcium-transporting ATPase that plays a key role in calcium homeostasis. Specifically, SERCA2 pumps cytosolic calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle cells and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in non-muscle cells. This process allows for muscle relaxation and contributes to the overall regulation of cellular calcium levels.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly495Val (rs772120294): This missense mutation is associated with Darier disease.
- p.Val234Met (rs121918466): This missense mutation is associated with acrokeratosis verruciformis.
- p.Asp728Asn (rs796052694): This missense mutation is associated with Hailey-Hailey disease.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic variants in the ATP2A2 gene listed in dbSNP. However, most of these are not associated with any specific disease or condition. 

## Related Disease
Mutations in ATP2A2 are associated with Darier disease, acrokeratosis verruciformis, and Hailey-Hailey disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for any of the conditions associated with ATP2A2 mutations. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms and may include topical or oral medications, such as retinoids or antibiotics, or laser therapy. The prognosis for individuals with ATP2A2 mutations can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms. 

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available regarding drug response in individuals with ATP2A2 mutations.
