## Gene AKT2

### Genetic Position
AKT2 gene, also known as RAC-beta serine/threonine-protein kinase, is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

### Pathology
Genetic alterations in AKT2 and its subsequent overexpression are commonly observed in several cancers, including ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer. Mutations, amplification, and dysregulation of AKT2 gene expression are associated with cancer progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and poor prognosis.

### Function
AKT2 belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases, which play a crucial role in cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. It is responsible for the activation of several downstream molecules involved in cellular processes, such as glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression.

### Related Disease
AKT2 is associated with several diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. Overexpression of AKT2 in tumors has been linked to poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
AKT2 is a potential target in cancer treatment. Several drugs targeting AKT2 are under clinical trials, including MK-2206, ipatasertib, and AZD5363. However, the effectiveness of these drugs still needs to be validated in clinical settings.

### Drug Response
Variations in AKT2 gene influence drug response in cancer therapy. Studies have shown that targeting AKT2 can potentiate the effect of chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel and trastuzumab, in some cancer patients.
