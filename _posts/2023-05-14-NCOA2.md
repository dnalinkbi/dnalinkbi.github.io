# Genomic and Pathological Information of NCOA2 Gene

## Gene Function
NCOA2 (nuclear receptor coactivator 2) is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a role in regulating gene expression. It is known to interact with DNA-bound nuclear receptors to enhance their transcriptional activity. Additionally, it can interact with other transcription factors and modulate their function.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several non-synonymous variations identified in the NCOA2 gene which can lead to a change in the amino acid sequence. Some of the mutations are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| L215P | Missense | rs587777772 |
| L437Q | Missense | rs558361210 |
| Y515C | Missense | rs758250816 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels in the NCOA2 gene listed in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Some studies have linked NCOA2 mutations with endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and other malignancies. NCOA2 amplification has also been found in some cases of breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for NCOA2 mutations, and the treatment usually depends on the associated disease. The prognosis of NCOA2 mutations is uncertain as more research is needed to determine their clinical significance.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response to NCOA2 mutations.
