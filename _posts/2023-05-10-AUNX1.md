## Gene AUNX1

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chr. 1q21.3  
- **Pathology:** No significant association with any disease has been reported yet, but this gene is actively being studied.  
- **Function:** AUNX1 gene encodes for a protein called autophagy and beclin-1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1), which plays a crucial role in the autophagy process, cell proliferation, and differentiation, and also in neuronal differentiation.
