## Information about Gene SEPT6

### Genetic Position
Gene SEPT6 is located on chromosome 22q11.21. Its genomic coordinates are 17,399,576 - 17,432,985. 

### Pathology and Function
SEPT6 encodes for a septin protein, a member of a family of GTP-binding proteins involved in diverse cellular processes, including cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and membrane remodeling. It is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. 

Mutations in SEPT6 have been implicated in various diseases, including oncogenesis, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

### Related Disease
- Oncogenesis: SEPT6 has been implicated in promoting tumorigenic properties in several cancers, including breast, colon, and kidney cancer.
- Bipolar Disorder: Several studies have found that SEPT6 expression levels are altered in bipolar disorder patients compared to controls.
- Alzheimer's Disease: SEPT6 has been found to co-localize with tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment or prognosis associated with SEPT6 mutations or altered expression levels in disease.

### Drug Response
There is little known about drug response specific to SEPT6 mutations.
