### Gene: HOXB13

#### Information:

- **Genomic location:** Chromosome 17q21.32
- **Aliases:** HOX2, HOX2F, HOX2G

- **Function:** The HOXB13 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a vital role in the development of prostate cells by regulating the expression of various genes. It also plays a significant role in the development of the urogenital system, bone formation, and endothelial cell differentiation.

    - c.876G>A (rs786205148)

- **Related diseases:** Mutations in the HOXB13 gene are associated with susceptibility to **prostate cancer** and **hereditary breast cancer**.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** The treatment of cancer associated with HOXB13 mutation depends on the stage of cancer, age, and general health of the patient. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. The prognosis for prostate cancer patients with a HOXB13 mutation is usually poor compared to those without it.

- **Drug response:** There is no current information about drug response associated with HOXB13 mutations.
