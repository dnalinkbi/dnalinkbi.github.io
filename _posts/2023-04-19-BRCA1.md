### Gene Information

#### Gene Symbol: BRCA1 

#### Pathology: 
Mutations in BRCA1 can lead to an increased risk for developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and other types of cancer. 

#### Function: 
BRCA1 is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and maintenance of genomic stability. 

#### External IDs and Genomic Location: 
1. HGNC: 1101 
2. NCBI Entrez Gene: 672 
3. Ensembl: ENSG00000012048 
4. OMIM: 113705 
5. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P38398

Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q21.31

Aliases: BRCC1, BROVCA1, PNCA4, RNF53

|--------|--------|
|c.4956delA|rs80359130|

#### Related Disease: 
Breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and other types of cancer.

#### Treatment and Prognosis: 
Patients with BRCA1 mutations may opt for prophylactic surgery to reduce the risk of cancer, such as prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy. They may also undergo increased surveillance, such as annual breast MRI or transvaginal ultrasound. 

#### Drug Response: 
Patients with BRCA1 mutations may benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy, which has shown efficacy in treating breast and ovarian cancer.
