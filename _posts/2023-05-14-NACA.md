# Gene NACA

## Summary

Gene NACA is located on chromosome 12 at position q13.11. It encodes for the nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha subunit (NACA), involved in protein synthesis. The gene is associated with several diseases, including breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

## Function

The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of alpha and beta subunits. The NAC complex binds to nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from ribosomes and is involved in folding and stabilization of newly synthesized proteins. The NACA subunit plays a role in ribosome binding and is essential for the function of NAC.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no known amino acid (AA) mutations for NACA with dbSNP ID.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs or InDels for NACA with dbSNP ID.

## Related disease

NACA is associated with several diseases, including:

- Breast cancer: NACA is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and is considered a prognostic marker for this disease.
- Alzheimer's disease: NACA has been found to be downregulated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting it may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

## Treatment and prognosis

There are currently no specific treatments available for diseases associated with NACA. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and stage of diagnosis.

## Drug response

Currently, there are no known drugs that target NACA.
