## Information about Gene E2F5

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

Gene E2F5 is located on chromosome 8 (8p21.3) and it encodes for a transcription factor that is part of the E2F family. The E2F family of transcription factors play a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, DNA replication, and apoptosis. E2F5 has been shown to have a role in the repression of cell cycle genes, thereby controlling cell growth and differentiation. 

Mutations in the E2F5 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. 

### Function for Gene

The E2F5 protein functions as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and differentiation.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location

External IDs for the E2F5 gene include HGNC: 3239, NCBI Entrez: 1876, Ensembl: ENSG00000120810, OMIM: 601948, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15329. The genomic location of E2F5 is 8p21.3.

Aliases for the E2F5 gene include E2F-5, Rb-binding protein E2F5, retinoblastoma-associated protein E2F5, and transcription factor E2F5.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid mutations that have been reported for the E2F5 gene. These include:

- p.R411W (rs41290666) - missense mutation 
- p.A484V (rs774201063) - missense mutation 
- p.R184H (rs376798729) - missense mutation 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) and InDels (Insertion/Deletion) have been reported for the E2F5 gene. The dbSNP IDs for these variations are available in public mutation databases such as COSMIC, ClinVar, TCGA, and cBioPortal.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the E2F5 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including:

- Breast cancer 
- Lung cancer 
- Bladder cancer 

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for cancers associated with mutations in the E2F5 gene may vary depending on the specific cancer type and stage. Prognosis may also differ depending on the individual case.

### Drug Response

The literature on the drug response of cancers associated with E2F5 mutations is limited.
