## Information about Gene ERAP2

**Genetic Position:** ERAP2 gene is located on chromosome 5 at the position 5q15.

**Function for Gene:** The ERAP2 gene encodes an enzyme called endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 which processes antigenic peptides for presentation by MHC class I molecules.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000145335
- OMIM ID: 606832
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6P179
- Aliases: ARTS2, KIAA0525, LNPEP2

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- c.1546G>A (p.Arg516His) - rs26232
- c.2669G>A (p.Gly890Arg) - rs3734016
- c.2669G>T (p.Gly890Val) - rs3734017
