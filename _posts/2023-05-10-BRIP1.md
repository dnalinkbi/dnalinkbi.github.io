## Information on Gene BRIP1

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic position**: BRIP1 is located on chromosome 17q23.2.

- **Pathology**: Mutations in this gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.

- **Function**: BRIP1 (BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1) encodes a DNA helicase that functions in DNA repair and recombination. It interacts with the breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA1, and together they play a critical role in maintaining genome stability.

### External IDs, aliases & sites

- **External IDs**: This gene is also known as Fanconi anemia group J protein (FANCJ).

- **Aliases**: BRIP1, FANCJ, BACH1 (BRCA1-associated C-terminal helicase 1).

- **External sites**:
    - HGNC: 11006
    - NCBI Entrez: 83990
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000141510
    - OMIM: 605882
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BX63

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- **AA mutations**: A list of BRIP1 missense mutations and their amino acid changes is presented in Table 1:

| rs80357617 | Exon 5    | c.1167G>A | p.Arg389Gln        |

- **Mutation type**: Missense, stop-gain.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in BRIP1 at this time.

### Related Disease

- **Related Disease**: Mutations in BRIP1 have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.

### Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment**: Currently, there is no specific treatment for cancers associated with BRIP1 mutations. However, patients with these mutations may be eligible for clinical trials that target the DNA damage response pathway.

- **Prognosis**: The prognosis for patients with BRIP1 mutations and cancer may depend on various factors, including the type and stage of cancer, age, and overall health.

### Drug Response

- There is currently no information about drug responses specific to BRIP1 mutations.
