# Information about gene KLK1

## Genetic Position
The KLK1 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.3.

## Pathology and Function
The KLK1 gene encodes for the protein called kallikrein-related peptidase 1 (KLK1), which belongs to the kallikrein family of serine proteases. KLK1 is primarily expressed in the kidneys and plays a role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance by cleaving kininogen to produce the vasodilator peptide bradykinin. It also has additional functions in tissue repair, inflammation, and angiogenesis.

## Gene Information
- Function: Kallikrein-related peptidase 1, involved in blood pressure regulation and other physiological processes
- External IDs: HGNC:6324, NCBI Entrez Gene:3816, Ensembl:ENSG00000104567, OMIM:602380, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P06870
- Aliases: KLKR, KLK-L1, hGK2, Kalikrein-1, TPK, K1F, Klk1f

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported mutations on the KLK1 gene. Some of them are as follows:

- G189A (p.Gly63Arg) - rs28929476
- C218G (p.Ala73Gly) - rs7257275
- A429G (p.Asn143Ser) - rs28929477

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic variants on the KLK1 gene have not been reported yet.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the KLK1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension in some populations, as well as with diabetic nephropathy and preeclampsia. However, further studies are needed to confirm these associations.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Current treatments for diseases related to KLK1 mutations are focused on managing symptoms and reducing the risk of complications. It is important for patients with these mutations to monitor their blood pressure levels and kidney function regularly. Prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on how KLK1 mutations may affect drug response.
