## Gene: RHOA

### Overview

RHOA is a protein-coding gene involved in cell movement, actin cytoskeleton organization, and the second messenger system. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several diseases, including cancer, hypertension, and asthma. 

### Function

RHOA is a small GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and cytokinesis. It is also involved in the regulation of secondary messengers, including cAMP, MAP kinase, and NF-κB signaling pathways.

### Drug Response

- ROCK inhibitors (e.g., Fasudil, Y-27632, AT13148) 
- RhoA inhibitors (e.g., Rhosin)
- Statins (e.g., Atorvastatin)
