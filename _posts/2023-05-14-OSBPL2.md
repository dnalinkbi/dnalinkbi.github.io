# Information about gene OSBPL2

## Genetic Position
The OSBPL2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.33). 

## Pathology
Mutations in the OSBPL2 gene have been associated with several diseases, including osteoporosis, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. 

## Function
The OSBPL2 gene encodes a protein called oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 2 (ORP2), which plays a role in cholesterol metabolism and intracellular lipid transport.
