# Information about Gene TUBB4B

## Genetic Position and Pathology

The TUBB4B gene is located on chromosome 19q13.42, and it encodes a beta-tubulin protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with multiple neurological disorders, including congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3 (CFEOM3), polymicrogyria with seizures (PMGYS), and isolated dystonia.

## Function for Gene

The beta-tubulin protein encoded by TUBB4B plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics, which are necessary for cell division, intracellular trafficking, and the maintenance of neuronal structure and function.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the TUBB4B gene have been associated with multiple neurological disorders, including:
- Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3 (CFEOM3)
- Polymicrogyria with seizures (PMGYS)
- Isolated dystonia

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options for these neurological disorders vary depending on the specific diagnosis and severity of symptoms. Some patients may benefit from physical therapy, surgery, or medication. Prognosis also varies and can range from mild to severe disabilities, depending on the specific disorder and personal circumstances.

## Drug Response

There is currently limited information on drug response for patients with TUBB4B-associated neurological disorders.
