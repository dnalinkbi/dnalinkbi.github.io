# Information about Gene PLCD1

## Genetic Position:
The PLCD1 gene is located on chromosome 3q26.1.

## Pathology:
Mutations in the PLCD1 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB81) and a rare form of hereditary leukonychia (HL). 

## Function:
The PLCD1 gene encodes a protein named phospholipase C delta 1, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. This enzyme regulates the production of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by hydrolyzing the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).

## External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC ID: 9023
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 5331
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000175275
- OMIM ID: 608120
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q01970
- Aliases: NPHL3, PLCD, PLCD1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are various mutations reported in the PLCD1 gene. Some of them are as follows:
- p.Thr495Met (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs587776829
- p.Gln515* (nonsense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs387906892
- p.Cys460Arg (missense mutation) with dbSNP ID rs587776830

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There is no report of somatic SNVs/InDels in the PLCD1 gene available in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases:
- Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB81)
- Hereditary leukonychia (HL)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no known cure for DFNB81 and HL. However, hearing aids or cochlear implants can help people with hearing loss. Additionally, proper nail care can help manage HL.

## Drug Response:
There is no available information on drug response related to the PLCD1 gene.
