# Information about gene CHCHD7 

## Genetic Position 
The CHCHD7 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position 26.1.

## Pathology 
Mutations in the CHCHD7 gene are known to cause the autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder known as CHARGE syndrome.

## Function for gene
CHCHD7 gene encodes a protein that is involved in mitochondrial function and metabolism.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The following missense mutations have been identified in the CHCHD7 gene:
- c.215G>A (p.Gly72Ser) rs74315433
- c.896T>C (p.Phe299Leu) rs587784000

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no known somatic mutation reported in the CHCHD7 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CHCHD7 gene are associated with CHARGE syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organs and systems of the body. The characteristic features of CHARGE syndrome include coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for CHARGE syndrome. Treatment involves managing the symptoms and usually requires a team of specialists, including a pediatrician, ophthalmologist, audiologist, endocrinologist, and others.

## Drug Response
There is no information available regarding drug response for the CHCHD7 gene.
