# Gene Information for IL2

## Gene function
IL2 (Interleukin 2) gene codes for a cytokine that plays a crucial role in immune system regulation by stimulating the proliferation of T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. It is also involved in cytokine cascades that regulate the immune response.

## Gene and genomic location, Aliases
- Gene name: IL2
- Genomic location: Chromosome 4q26-q27
- Aliases: TCGF, Aldesleukin

## External IDs
- HGNC: 5979
- NCBI Entrez: 3558
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109471
- OMIM: 147680
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P60568

## AA mutation list and type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid mutations have been reported for the IL2 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the IL2 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related disease
- Mutations in the IL2 gene have not been reported in association with any disease. However, dysregulation of IL2 signaling has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

## Treatment and prognosis
- The administration of recombinant IL2 (aldesleukin) has been used as a cancer immunotherapy to stimulate the immune system to attack tumor cells. Almediade, a sustained-release formulation of aldesleukin, has also been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
- The prognosis for cancer patients treated with IL2 immunotherapy varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug response
- The response to IL2 immunotherapy varies among cancer patients and is influenced by factors such as age, gender, and immune status.
- IL2 immunotherapy has been shown to induce complete and durable responses in some melanoma and renal cell carcinoma patients.
