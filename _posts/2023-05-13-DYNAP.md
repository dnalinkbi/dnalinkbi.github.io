# Gene DYNAP

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 3, region q29
- **Pathology:** Mutations in DYNAP have been associated with intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia.
- **Function:** DYNAP encodes for the Dynein-associated protein, which has a role in the intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. It also plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cellular division.

## Identifiers and Aliases

- **Gene ID:** 8655
- **Genomic Location:** NC_000003.12 (35452960..35793547)
- **Aliases:** DYMAP, DAP-3, DNAP, DYNAP, P50/DAP50

- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations are the most common type of mutation in DYNAP.
- **dbSNP ID:** Some of the common dbSNP IDs associated with DYNAP mutations are rs1064791099, rs797045454, and rs756830660.

## Related Disease

Mutations in DYNAP have been associated with the following diseases:

- Intellectual disability
- Autism
- Schizophrenia

## Treatment and Prognosis 

There is currently no cure for intellectual disability, autism, or schizophrenia. Treatment usually involves a combination of medication, therapy, and support. The prognosis for individuals with mutations in DYNAP varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is currently no specific drug that targets mutations in DYNAP. However, medications used to treat intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia may improve symptoms in some individuals.
