# Gene KLLN
## Genetic position
KLLN (Killin, p15) is a gene located on chromosome 10q23.

## Pathology
KLLN is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. It functions as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Downregulation or loss of KLLN expression has been associated with various cancer types, including breast, lung, gastric, and ovarian cancer.

## Function
KLLN is involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. It interacts with several proteins involved in these processes, including p53, MDM2, and CDK2. KLLN also plays a role in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

## Related disease
Downregulation or loss of KLLN expression has been associated with various cancer types, including breast, lung, gastric, and ovarian cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
The downregulation of KLLN expression has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in some cancer types. However, more research is needed to establish the potential of KLLN as a therapeutic target.

## Drug response
No drugs have been reported to specifically target KLLN gene.
