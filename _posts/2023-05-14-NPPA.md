# Information about Gene NPPA

## Genetic Position
The NPPA gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.21.

## Pathology
Mutations in the NPPA gene have been associated with cardiovascular diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. 

## Function
The NPPA gene encodes for a cardiac hormone called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and volume by relaxing blood vessels and promoting the excretion of sodium and water.

- OMIM: 108780
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01160
- Aliases: ANP, ATRN, PND

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations reported in the NPPA gene. Some of them are:
- Gln25Leu (rs1800453)
- Ser103Ala (rs1800454)
- Thr223Asn (rs5065)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some examples of somatic SNVs/InDels in the NPPA gene are:
- c.309G>A (rs41275738)
- c.470C>T (rs77038813)
- c.847A>G (rs77856032)

## Related disease
Mutations in the NPPA gene have been associated with various cardiovascular diseases, including:
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OMIM: 192600)
- Atrial fibrillation (OMIM: 608583)
- Heart failure (OMIM: 142900)

## Treatment and prognosis
There are several treatments available for cardiovascular diseases associated with NPPA gene mutations, including medication, lifestyle changes, and surgery. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment.

## Drug response
Some drugs that target the ANP pathway, such as nesiritide, have been developed to treat heart failure. However, the response to these drugs varies among individuals and depends on the specific mutation in the NPPA gene.
