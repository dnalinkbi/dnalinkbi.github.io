# Information about Gene ATL1

### Genetic Position 
- Gene: ATL1 (Atlastin-1)
- Chromosome: 14
- Location: 14q22.1

### Pathology
- Mutations in the ATL1 gene are associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Type 3A (HSP3A).
- HSP3A is a neurological disorder that causes weakness and spasticity (stiffness) in the lower limbs.

### Function for Gene
- The ATL1 protein is involved in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is responsible for folding and transporting many proteins within the cell.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 19394
- NCBI Entrez: 274
- Ensembl: ENSG00000198626
- OMIM: 606439
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8WXF7
- Aliases: SPG3A, SPG3, KIAA0104

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.796G>A (p.Arg266Gln) rs121908283
- c.941C>T (p.Arg314Ter) rs387906645
- c.155C>T (p.Leu52Phe) rs121908284
- c.811G>T (p.Val271Phe) rs121908285

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations reported for ATL1 gene.

### Related Disease
- Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Type 3A (HSP3A)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for HSP3A aim at alleviating the symptoms of the disorder rather than curing it.
- Prognosis for HSP3A varies depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
- No specific drug response reported for HSP3A.
