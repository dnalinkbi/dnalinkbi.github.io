# Information about gene PROC

## Gene position
The PROC gene is located on chromosome 2 at the q13.1 region.

## Pathology
The deficiency of protein C, which is encoded by the PROC gene, is associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis, which can result in deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

## Function
The protein C is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. It acts as an anticoagulant by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa in the coagulation cascade.

## Related disease
- Thrombophilia due to protein C deficiency, autosomal dominant
- Thrombophilia due to protein C deficiency, autosomal recessive

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for protein C deficiency involves anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin. In severe cases, protein C concentrate can be given. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the deficiency and the presence of other risk factors.

## Drug response
There have been studies that show that certain genetic variations in the PROC gene can affect the response to warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant. Patients with these variations may require different doses of warfarin to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.
