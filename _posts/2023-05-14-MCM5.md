## Gene: MCM5

MCM5 is a gene located on chromosome 22 that encodes for a protein involved in the process of DNA replication. It is a member of the Minichromosome Maintenance (MCM) complex that is essential for the initiation of DNA synthesis and replication fork progression.

### Function:
The MCM complex has helicase activity that helps to unwind the DNA double helix, allowing other proteins to access the DNA strands, and to initiate DNA replication. MCM5 protein specifically plays a crucial role in DNA replication initiation and elongation.

- c.1234G>T (rs146310492)

### Related Disease:
Abnormality or mutations in MCM5 gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to some types of cancer, including breast, ovarian and bladder cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment and prognosis for cancer associated with mutations in MCM5 gene are not well studied. Different types of cancer that are associated with this gene may require individualized treatments.

### Drug Response:
There is no known drug that targets MCM5 directly. However, some drugs targeting DNA replication have been studied in cancer therapy.
