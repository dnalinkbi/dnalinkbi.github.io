# Gene: TTBK2

## Information

- Pathology: TTBK2 has been implicated in several neurological conditions, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia.

- Function: TTBK2 encodes tau-tubulin kinase 2, which is responsible for phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and plays critical roles in regulating microtubule dynamics and stability. Additionally, it also involved in ciliogenesis, cell migration, and cell division.

- Genomic location: Chromosome 11, q14.1

- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 28671 
    - NCBI Entrez: 146057 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000169045 
    - OMIM: 613885 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6BDS2

- Aliases: KIAA0478, TTBK3

## Mutations

- AA mutation list: A list of AA mutations is available on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: [Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6BDS2#mutations)
- Mutation type: Mostly missense mutations have been reported
- dbSNP ID: rs763612974

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- Somatic SNVs/InDels data are not available right now.

## Related Disease

- Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Schizophrenia

## Treatment and Prognosis

- No specific treatment or cure available for neurological diseases associated with TTBK2. 
- Management of symptoms is the only available option.

## Drug Response
