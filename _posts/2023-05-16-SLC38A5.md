# Genetic Information Analysis on Gene SLC38A5

## Gene Overview
SLC38A5 gene is located at the chromosomal position 2p13.3. This gene encodes a protein belonging to the SLC38 family of solute carriers, and it is also known as sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 5 (SNAT5). The protein is mainly expressed in the liver, kidney, and small intestine.

## Gene Function
SLC38A5 protein is a transport protein that is involved in the uptake of amino acids into cells. It specifically transports neutral amino acids such as alanine, serine, and cysteine into cells. Hence, the SLC38A5 gene is important for metabolism and cell growth.
