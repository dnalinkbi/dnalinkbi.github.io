## Gene Information

### Gene: DGCR6

DGCR6, which stands for DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 6, is a gene located on chromosome 22q11.2. This gene encodes a protein called the enteric neural crest-derived protein. It is also known by other names such as PSCDBP, PP14488, and JAM4.

## Function

The function of DGCR6 is not well understood. Research studies have suggested that this gene may play a role in the development of the enteric nervous system, which regulates the movement of food through the digestive system.

## External IDs and Genomic Location

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations associated with the DGCR6 gene. The most common mutation is the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which results in the loss of several genes, including DGCR6. Other mutations include:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M54L | Missense | rs7799342 |
| E70K | Missense | rs35407879 |
| T91M | Missense | rs147951386 |
| P100A | Missense | rs35309315 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for DGCR6.

## Related Disease

The loss of DGCR6 has been associated with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome. This is a genetic disorder that affects many systems of the body, including the heart, immune system, and facial features.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and associated health problems. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the specific health problems present.

## Drug Response

There is no information available on drug response specifically related to DGCR6 mutations.
