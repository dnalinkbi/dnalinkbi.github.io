# Information about Gene VMA21

## Genetic Position

The gene VMA21 is located on the short arm of the X chromosome at position Xp22.2.

## Pathology

Mutations in VMA21 are responsible for X-linked recessive spinal muscular atrophy, a neuromuscular disorder. This disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting due to the loss of spinal motor neurons.

## Function for Gene

The VMA21 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the assembly and regulation of a proton pump found in the membranes of cells. This pump is important for maintaining the acidic environment necessary for the proper functioning of cellular processes.

## Related Disease 

VMA21 mutations are responsible for X-linked recessive spinal muscular atrophy.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for X-linked recessive spinal muscular atrophy. Treatment involves managing the symptoms of the disease, such as physical therapy and respiratory support. The prognosis for individuals with this disease varies, depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is no specific drug treatment available for X-linked recessive spinal muscular atrophy. However, some drugs may help manage certain symptoms of the disease, such as muscle weakness.
