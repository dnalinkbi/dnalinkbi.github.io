# Information about gene MMP1

## Genetic position
MMP1 gene is located on chromosome 11q22.3.

## Pathology
MMP1 encodes a protein called matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) which is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. MMP-1 is mainly expressed in fibroblasts and plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes including tissue repair and remodeling, angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer metastasis.

## Function
The function of MMP1 is to degrade ECM proteins, particularly collagen type I, which is the main component of the connective tissue. This process is necessary for tissue repair and remodeling, but inappropriate activation of MMP1 can lead to tissue destruction and contribute to various pathological conditions.

## Related disease
MMP1 has been associated with various diseases including cancer, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular diseases.

## Treatment and prognosis
Several drugs targeting MMP1 activity have been developed for cancer treatment, however, their clinical efficacy is still limited. The prognosis of diseases associated with MMP1 depends on the extent and severity of ECM degradation and tissue destruction.

## Drug response
The response to MMP1 inhibitors varies among individuals and depends on the type and severity of the disease.
