## Gene ERCC1

### Information
The ERCC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in repairing damaged DNA. This gene provides the instructions for producing a protein called excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), which works in conjunction with a complex of proteins called ERCC4, XPF, and DNA ligase I to repair DNA.

- c.354T>C - Substitution - dbSNP ID: rs17867990
- c.424delC - Deletion - dbSNP ID: rs786201005
- c.285+2T>G - Splice donor - dbSNP ID: rs786201005

### Related Disease
Variants in ERCC1 have been associated with certain types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
ERCC1 mutations can affect a patient's response to certain types of chemotherapy, such as platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with ERCC1 mutations may have a worse prognosis in certain types of cancer.

### Drug Response
ERCC1 mutations can affect a patient's response to certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as platinum-based chemotherapy. It is important to accurately determine a patient's ERCC1 status to determine the most effective treatment plan.
