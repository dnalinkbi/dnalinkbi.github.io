# Gene: GMPS

## Information

- **Function**: GMPS (Guanine monophosphate synthase) is an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. It catalyzes the conversion of XMP to GMP, which is a crucial step in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location**: 
    - Gene ID: 2999
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 3q25.31
    - Aliases: C1orf45, HFRC1, IMPCHase 

- **External sites**: 
    - HGNC: 4399
    - NCBI Entrez: 2999
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000145088
    - OMIM: 601418
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49915

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - c.340G>A (p.Ala114Thr) rs7893736
    - c.472C>T (p.Leu158Phe) rs2229132
    - c.513T>G (p.Cys171Gly) rs36001488
    - c.549G>T (p.Glu183Ter) rs774706965

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
    - c.315A>C (p.Ser105Arg) rs80359540 

- **Related disease**: GMPS has been implicated in various human disorders, including:
    - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), autosomal recessive, type 2B1 (OMIM: 605589)
    - Deafness, autosomal recessive 15 (OMIM: 601071)
    - Combined immunodeficiency, X-linked (OMIM: 312863)

- **Treatment and prognosis**: The treatment and prognosis of GMPS-related diseases are largely dependent on the specific disorder and the severity of the symptoms. Treatment options may include medications, physical therapy, and/or surgical interventions. Prognosis can vary widely, depending on the disease and its progression.

- **Drug response**: There is currently no information on drug response specific to GMPS-related disorders.
