# Gene: P2RY4

## Genetic Position
The P2RY4 gene is located on chromosome 11q13.4 and spans a genomic region of about 4.8 kilobases.

## Pathology and Function
P2RY4 codes for the purinergic receptor P2Y4, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by extracellular nucleotides. This receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, bladder, and immune cells. Studies suggest that P2Y4 plays a role in inflammation, gastrointestinal motility, and tumorigenesis.

## Related Disease
Studies suggest that P2Y4 may be involved in the development and progression of various diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders, liver diseases, and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments available for targeting P2Y4 in disease conditions. The prognosis of diseases associated with P2Y4 may vary depending on the severity and stage of the condition.

## Drug Response
Studies suggest that P2Y4 may be a target for developing therapeutic agents for various diseases. Some compounds that have been shown to modulate P2Y4 activity include UDP-glucose, 2-Methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate, and diadenosine tetraphosphate.
