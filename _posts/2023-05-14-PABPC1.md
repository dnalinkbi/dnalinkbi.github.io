# Information on Gene PABPC1

## Genetic Position
The PABPC1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q22.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in the PABPC1 gene have been linked to numerous diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders.

## Function
The PABPC1 gene encodes for poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) which plays a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Specifically, PABP binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNA and facilitates translation initiation, mRNA stability, and 3' end processing.
