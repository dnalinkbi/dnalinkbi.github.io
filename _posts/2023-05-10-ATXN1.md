# Gene Information for ATXN1 

### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 6, long arm (6p23)
- **Pathology:** The ATXN1 gene is associated with several degenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). SCA1 is a rare, progressive neurological disorder that affects muscle coordination resulting in poor balance, unsteady gait, and difficulty with speech and swallowing.  
- **Function:** The ATXN1 gene encodes a protein called ataxin-1. This protein plays a role in the regulation of gene transcription, RNA processing, and protein turnover. 

### External IDs, Aliases, and Sites
- **External IDs:** ATXN1 gene has Entrez Gene ID: **6310**
- **Genomic Location:** The ATXN1 gene spans a region of approximately **200 kb** and includes nine exons. 
- **Aliases:** Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, ataxin 1

### AA Mutation List, Mutation Type, and dbSNP ID
- ATXN1 gene is known to undergo DNA repeat expansion, which leads to an abnormally long glutamine tract in the ataxin-1 protein. The expansion of the repeat unit occurs within exon 1 of the gene, and leads to mutations in the amino-acid sequence of ataxin-1.
- **Mutation Type:** Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion
- **AA Mutation List:**  The repeat expansion of CAG trinucleotides in ATXN1 leads to the formation of an elongated polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-1 protein. Individuals with SCA1 typically have  repeats ranging from **39-81 CAG**.
- **dbSNP ID:** rs115558091, rs28929474, rs28936670, rs28937296, rs28939600

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified in the ATXN1 gene till date.

### Related Diseases
- **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1):** SCA1 is a rare, progressive neurological disorder that affects muscle coordination resulting in poor balance, unsteady gait, and difficulty with speech and swallowing.
- **Occasional association with other diseases:** Some studies have reported occasional associations of ATXN1 with other disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for SCA1, and treatment options are limited. However, several therapies aimed at reducing the severity of symptoms are available. These treatments include physical therapy, speech therapy, and medication to control muscle spasms.
- The prognosis for SCA1 varies depending on the severity of the condition. Individuals with SCA1 typically experience a gradual decline in muscle function, and may eventually require assistance with daily activities.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no drug available that can reverse or halt the progression of SCA1. However, several studies are ongoing to explore the possibility of developing drugs to treat SCA1.
