# Gene: CYP26C1

## Genetic Position
- The gene CYP26C1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q23.33).

## Pathology
- CYP26C1 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of retinoic acid, a signaling molecule that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation.
- Mutations in the CYP26C1 gene can lead to an imbalance of retinoic acid levels, which has been associated with various developmental disorders and diseases, such as cancer.

## Function
- CYP26C1 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 family, which is involved in the breakdown of retinoic acid.
- Its function is to catalyze the metabolism of retinoic acid to inactive metabolites, thereby regulating the concentration of this molecule in cells.

## External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: CYP26C1, NCBI Gene: 148227, Ensembl: ENSG00000204393, OMIM: 609936, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q2PHI7
- Aliases: Retinoic acid 4-hydroxylase CYP26C1, cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily C member 1, P450RAI3

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several annotated mutations for CYP26C1 available in dbSNP database. Here are some of them:
    - p.Arg83Cys, missense mutation, rs36058443
    - p.Val124Met, missense mutation, rs730880617
    - p.Lys166Asn, missense mutation, rs56055415

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- The dbSNP database also contains somatic variations for CYP26C1. Here is an example:
    - c.518C>T, p.Thr173Ile, rs1064796972

## Related Disease
- The abnormal expression or activity of CYP26C1 has been linked to many human diseases, including:
    - Cancer (e.g., lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer)
    - Dermatologic disorders (e.g., psoriasis)
    - Craniofacial malformations (e.g., cleft lip and palate)
    - Cardiovascular disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Since retinoic acid plays a pivotal role in human development and homeostasis, modulating CYP26C1 activity may have therapeutic potential in treating related diseases.
- The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder, and more research is needed to determine the clinical significance of CYP26C1 for disease prognosis.

## Drug Response
- Some drugs have been shown to interact with CYP26C1 or its enzymatic activity, including all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and its derivatives. Therefore, these drugs may have the potential to modulate the retinoic acid pathway and treat related disorders.
