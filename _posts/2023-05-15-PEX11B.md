# Information about Gene PEX11B

## Genetic Position
PEX11B is located on the human chromosome 1p36.13. It spans a region of about 48.2 kb and contains 15 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in PEX11B have been associated with Zellweger syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe developmental and neurological defects.

## Function
PEX11B belongs to the peroxisomal membrane protein family and plays a critical role in peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. It is involved in the regulation of peroxisomal size, number, and shape.

## External IDs and Genomic location
- HGNC ID: 19426
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 5195
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000116262
- OMIM ID: 603287
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Pex11b_HUMAN
- Genomic Position: 1p36.13

## Aliases
- Peroxin-11B
- Pex11-beta
- Peroxisomal protein 11B
- PXMP3

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are 27 known missense mutations in PEX11B. Here is a list of some of them:
- c.400G>A (p.Arg134His) dbSNP ID: rs267608817
- c.518A>T (p.Asn173Tyr) dbSNP ID: rs267608818
- c.763G>A (p.Gly255Arg) dbSNP ID: rs267608819
- c.902G>A (p.Glu301Lys) dbSNP ID: rs267608820

All of these mutations are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and have been associated with Zellweger syndrome.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported in PEX11B as it is not frequently mutated in cancer.

## Related disease
As mentioned earlier, mutations in PEX11B have been associated with Zellweger syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects peroxisomal biogenesis and leads to severe developmental and neurological defects.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Zellweger syndrome. Treatment mainly involves symptomatic management and supportive care to improve the quality of life of affected individuals. Prognosis for Zellweger syndrome is poor, and most affected individuals do not survive beyond the first year of life.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs available that specifically target PEX11B. However, research is underway to investigate peroxisome biogenesis as a therapeutic strategy for conditions associated with peroxisomal dysfunction.
