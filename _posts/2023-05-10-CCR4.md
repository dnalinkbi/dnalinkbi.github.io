# Gene CCR4

## Gene Information

- **Function:** The CCR4 gene encodes a chemokine receptor that regulates the immune response by controlling the migration and activation of immune cells like T-cells, monocytes, and eosinophils.
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 1602; Ensembl: ENSG00000160791; NCBI Entrez: 1233; OMIM: 601268; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51679
- **Aliases:** CC-CKR-4, C-C chemokine receptor type 4, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 4

## Genetic Location and Pathology

- **Chromosome:** 3
- **Arm:** p
- **Band:** 21.31
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the CCR4 gene have been associated with various diseases like allergic diseases including asthma and atopic dermatitis, cancer, and viral infections.

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List:** Some of the amino acid mutations in the CCR4 gene with their mutation type and dbSNP IDs are:
  - Ala21Thr (Missense) - rs2228582
  - Arg18Trp (Missense) - rs11575833
  - Ser313Asn (Missense) - rs2228428
  - Ala203Thr (Missense) - rs12109167
- **Somatic SNVs/Indels:** Some of the somatic SNVs/Indels in the CCR4 gene with their dbSNP IDs are:

  - rs11575833

## Related Diseases

- Asthma
- Atopic Dermatitis
- Cancer
- Viral infections

## Treatment and Prognosis

- The treatment and prognosis for diseases related to CCR4 gene mutations depend on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation.

## Drug Response

- The CCR4 receptor is a target for several drugs used in various diseases. For example, mogamulizumab is a monoclonal antibody drug that targets CCR4 and is used to treat some types of blood cancers.
