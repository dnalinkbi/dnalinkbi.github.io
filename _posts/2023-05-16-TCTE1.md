# Gene TCTE1

## Genetic Position
The gene TCTE1 is located on chromosome 6 at position 6p21.31.

## Pathology and Function
TCTE1 (T-complex-associated-testis-expressed 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly of motile cilia. It plays a vital role in fertility, as it is specifically expressed in mature spermatozoa. TCTE1 protein is essential for the proper function of the axoneme, which is the main structural component of cilia and flagella.

## Gene and Genomic Location
- Entrez GeneID: 148072
- HGNC ID: 18511
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000164410
- OMIM ID: none
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BRK5
- Aliases: none

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations reported in the TCTE1 gene. Some of them are:
- p.Pro146Ser (rs150802413)
- p.Lys156Met (rs779803844)
- p.Arg59Cys (rs794729469)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations reported in TCTE1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in TCTE1 have been linked to male infertility. Defects in cilia/flagella function have been associated with asthenozoospermia, which is characterized by reduced sperm motility.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for infertility associated with TCTE1 mutations. However, Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) like Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) could help the affected males to achieve pregnancy.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response associated with TCTE1 mutations.
