## Gene: IFT172

- **Function:** IFT172 encodes a protein involved in the assembly of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a role in sensory perception, movement, and signal transduction. Specifically, IFT172 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, which transports proteins along the ciliary structure.

- **External IDs:**
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 2; NC_000002.12 [chr2:74,731,639-74,970,854]
    - HGNC: 30515

    - Ensembl: ENSG00000115887
    - OMIM: 607386
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q5T1S3

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Pro1736Leu (missense); rs138154676
    - p.Asp1045Asn (missense); rs587781065
    - p.Arg210Trp (missense); rs377299559
    - p.Lys1657Glu (missense); rs149345873

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

- **Related disease:** IFT172 mutations have been associated with a type of short-rib thoracic dysplasia known as Majewski syndrome. This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple abnormalities in the chest and long bones.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for Majewski syndrome, and treatment is largely symptomatic. Patients may require respiratory support and orthopedic interventions to correct bone deformities.

- **Drug response:** No known drug response related to mutations in IFT172.
