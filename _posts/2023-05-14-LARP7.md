# Gene Information: LARP7

## Gene Function
LARP7 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of 7SK snRNA mediated transcriptional regulation. This protein is also involved in the maturation of ribosomal RNA.

## Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
External IDs for LARP7 gene: HGNC:6678, NCBI Entrez:51520

Genomic Location: Chromosome X: 75,659,215-75,688,987

Aliases: 15.5 kDa ribonucleoprotein, Mei-P26, La-related protein 7, protein la-related protein 7 homolog, LARP-7, PIP7S

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations associated with LARP7 gene such as p.K175R, p.T228A, p.I180T, p.A57T, p.R239W and many more. These mutations are primarily missense mutations that affect the function of the protein.

dbSNP IDs: rs149161200, rs776541442, rs192763520, rs143329693

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the LARP7 gene. Some of the dbSNP IDs are rs267607585, rs2229578, rs575816031, rs587782032, and rs545826253.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the LARP7 gene have been associated with Alazami syndrome and pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 4B.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for LARP7 gene mutations. Management of symptoms and supportive care are the current standard of care. Prognosis is variable depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
