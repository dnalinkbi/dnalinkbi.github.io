# Information about gene GDF5

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Gene Position**: GDF5 gene is located on human chromosome 20 (20q12).
- **Pathology**: Genetic variations in GDF5 gene have been associated with the risk of developing osteoarthritis and other skeletal dysplasias.
- **Function**: GDF5 gene encodes a protein called growth differentiation factor 5, which is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in cartilage and bone development.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for skeletal dysplasias caused by GDF5 gene mutations. Management primarily involves physical therapy, orthopedic interventions, and pain management.

## Drug Response
Research suggests that GDF5 gene variations may be associated with the risk of developing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).
