## Gene TST

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 22
- Location: 22q13.2

### Pathology:
- TST does not have a known direct association with any pathology.

### Function:
- The TST gene encodes for an enzyme called thiosulfate sulfurtransferase. This enzyme is involved in the catabolism of cysteine and homocysteine, which are important amino acids for protein synthesis and metabolism.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location:
- HGNC: 12247
- NCBI Entrez: 7263
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100212
- OMIM: 604287
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49585
- Aliases: Rhodanese, TST1, MPST

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- TST gene has several missense, frameshift, and nonsynonymous mutations. Here are some examples:
1. c.515C>T (p.Pro172Leu) - rs121965142
2. c.117G>A (p.Gly39Asp) - rs199889884
3. c.47G>T (p.Glu16Ter) - rs104894509

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- There are no known somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or insertions/deletions (InDels) associated with the TST gene.

### Related disease:
- TST gene mutations can lead to thiosulfate sulfurtransferase deficiency. Symptoms of deficiency may include neurological abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, and seizures.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment may involve a special diet and supportive therapies to manage the symptoms of the disorder. The long-term prognosis for affected individuals is not well understood.

### Drug Response:
- There is no known drug response associated with the TST gene.
