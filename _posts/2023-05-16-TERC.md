## Gene: TERC 

### Information: 

TERC is a human gene that is located on chromosome 3 and encodes for the RNA component of telomerase. Telomerase is an enzyme that is essential for the replication of telomeres which are found on the ends of chromosomes. 

### Function:

TERC encodes for an RNA molecule that is used as a template by telomerase, an enzyme that is responsible for maintaining and extending telomeres. Telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation and prevent loss of genetic information during cell division. Therefore, TERC plays a crucial role in cell division and survival.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:

There are several mutations associated with TERC. The most common mutation is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) called rs12696304, which is located in the upstream region of the gene. This SNP has been associated with decreased telomere length and an increased risk of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Apart from that, various AA mutations have been reported in TERC, including c.215C>T/p.Ala72Val(rs569499955).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

The somatic mutations that have been reported in TERC are as follows:

- rs143877688, c.202+2T>G

### Related disease:

Mutations in TERC have been associated with several diseases, including dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. DC is a rare genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body, including the skin, nails, and bone marrow. Patients with DC have a high risk of developing several types of cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis:

Currently, there is no cure for mutations in TERC. Treatment options depend on the specific disease and symptoms that are present. In general, treatment for DC includes symptomatic treatment of the various features of the disorder, such as bone marrow transplant, blood transfusions, and hormone replacement therapy.

### Drug response:

Currently, there are no drugs that specifically target mutations in TERC. However, several drugs have been developed to target telomerase, including imetelstat. Imetelstat has shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of DC and other telomere-related diseases.
