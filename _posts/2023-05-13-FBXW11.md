## Information about Gene FBXW11

### Genetic Position & Pathology
- Gene: FBXW11
- Location: Chromosome 5q35.2
- Pathology: FBXW11 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast and prostate cancer.

### Function
- FBXW11 encodes a protein that functions as a component of the SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in the degradation of various proteins, including those involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
