## Gene: LGR5

### Genetic Position and Genomic Location
LGR5 gene is located on chromosome 12q22-q23 ([GRCh38]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8549)).) 

### Pathology and Function
LGR5 gene codes for leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 protein which is a marker of stem cells in different organs like small intestine, stomach, hair follicles, colon, and others. It plays a crucial role in self-renewal process and differentiation of adult stem cells.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in LGR5 gene are associated with different cancers including:
- Colorectal cancer
- Gastric cancer
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Basal cell carcinoma

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for LGR5 gene mutations yet. However, patients with LGR5 positive tumors might benefit from targeted therapies like Wnt pathway inhibitors. Prognosis and survival rates depend on cancer stage, metastasis, and treatment options.

### Drug Response
LGR5 positive tumors might respond to Wnt pathway inhibitors like ICG-001 which is in clinical trials for various cancers.
