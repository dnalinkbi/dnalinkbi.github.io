### Information about gene HPD

- **Genetic position**: The gene HPD is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p12.2).
- **Pathology**: Mutations in HPD have been found to cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder called tyrosinemia type III, also known as Richner-Hanhart syndrome. This disorder affects the breakdown and metabolism of the amino acid tyrosine, leading to elevated levels of tyrosine and its byproducts in the blood and tissues.
- **Function for gene**: HPD encodes for the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which is involved in the final step of tyrosine metabolism. It catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid.
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 3312
    - Genomic location: NC_000012.12 (6697582..6709510)
    - Aliases: HPPD, 4-HPD
- **External sites**:
    - HGNC: 5179
    - NCBI Entrez: 3243
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000164680
    - OMIM: 613349
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P32754
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
    - c.412C>T (p.Arg138Trp) - rs137853302
    - c.575T>C (p.Ile192Thr) - rs137853301
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.
- **Related disease**: Tyrosinemia type III (Richner-Hanhart syndrome)
- **Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for tyrosinemia type III involves a low-protein diet and supplementation with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to help replace the deficiency of homogentisic acid. Prognosis is generally good if the disease is diagnosed early and treatment is started promptly.
- **Drug response**: Nitisinone, a drug commonly used to treat tyrosinemia type I, may also be effective in treating tyrosinemia type III by inhibiting the production of tyrosine and its byproducts.
