# Gene NDRG1

## Genetic Position
The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is located on chromosome 8q24.22, from 120,735,071 to 120,779,730 base pairs.

## Pathology
NDRG1 is associated with the progression and metastasis of various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, colon, liver, and lung cancer.

## Function
The NDRG1 protein is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and stress response. It is also involved in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, all of which are related to cancer.

## Related Disease
NDRG1 has been associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
As NDRG1 is associated with cancer progression and metastasis, it is being studied as a potential therapeutic target. Inhibition of NDRG1 has been shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in preclinical studies.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that the expression level of NDRG1 can predict the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
