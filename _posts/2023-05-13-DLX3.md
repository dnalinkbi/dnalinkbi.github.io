# Gene DLX3
- Function for gene: The DLX3 gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the teeth and bones.

- Related disease: Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome (TDO) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the DLX3 gene. TDO affects the development of hair, teeth, and bones, leading to brittle hair, teeth with enamel defects, and osteosclerosis.
- Treatment and prognosis: There is currently no cure for TDO. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, focused on dental and orthopedic management. The prognosis for TDO varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.
- Drug response: There is currently no drug specifically targeted at TDO.
