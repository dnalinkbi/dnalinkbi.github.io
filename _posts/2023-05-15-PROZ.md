# Information about Gene PROZ

## Genetic Position
The PROZ gene is located on chromosome 1 in the genomic position of 1q23.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PROZ gene have been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Inactivating mutations or deficiencies in PROZ have also been linked to a bleeding disorder known as protein Z deficiency.

## Function
The PROZ gene provides instructions for producing the protein Z, a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that functions as a cofactor for the anticoagulant protein C. Together, protein C and protein Z help regulate the blood clotting process.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the PROZ gene listed in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases
- Protein Z deficiency
- Thrombosis
- Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
- Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for patients with protein Z deficiency typically involves anticoagulation therapy using heparin, warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants. The prognosis for patients with protein Z deficiency depends on the severity of their symptoms and their response to treatment.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that patients with certain genetic variants in the PROZ gene may exhibit different responses to anticoagulation therapy. For example, carriers of the rs3024718 variant may require higher warfarin doses to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.
