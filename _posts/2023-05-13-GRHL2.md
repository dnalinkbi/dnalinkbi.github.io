# Gene: GRHL2

## Genetic Position
GRHL2 is located on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8q22.3).

## Pathology
GRHL2 is associated with several diseases including melanoma, breast cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma.

## Function
The GRHL2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating epithelial cell differentiation. It is involved in various cellular processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and wound healing.

## Related Disease
Mutations in GRHL2 have been associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and other epithelial cancers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment or cure for diseases associated with GRHL2 mutations. Patients with GRHL2-related cancers typically receive standard treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

## Drug Response
There is limited evidence indicating that specific drugs could target GRHL2-related cancers.
