# APOC4

## Gene information
APOC4 (Apolipoprotein C4) is a gene located on chromosome 19q13.2. It encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 6.7 kDa.

## Function
APOC4 is involved in lipid metabolism and transport. It is a component of lipoprotein particles and plays a role in the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood.
