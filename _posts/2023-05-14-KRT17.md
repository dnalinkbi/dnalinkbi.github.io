# Gene: KRT17
## Information
- **Function:** This gene encodes a type I intermediate filament protein that is part of the keratin family. Keratins are the major structural proteins in epithelial cells, which provide resilience against mechanical stress. This gene is specifically expressed in the basal cells of complex epithelia and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of hair, skin, and nails.
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 6445, NCBI Entrez: 3872, Ensembl: ENSG00000141867, OMIM: 148069, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q04695.
- **Aliases:** CK-17, EBS4, K17.
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 17q21.2. 
- **AA Mutation:** c.A424C (p.Q142P), c.G465C (p.V155L), c.C602T (p.P201L) are some of the mutations found in KRT17. The mutation types are all missense variants.
- **dbSNP ID:** rs121912667, rs121912668, rs60419889 are some dbSNP IDs for the KRT17 gene mutations mentioned above.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** KRT17 mutations are mostly associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and precancerous skin lesions leading to SCC. The somatic SNVs reported in COSMIC database are c.C602T, c.C175T, c.778_779delGA, c.C679T, c.141_146delCGCGGC, and c.154G>A.
- **Related Disease:** KRT17 mutations are mainly associated with pachyonychia congenita, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thick nails, painful palmoplantar keratoderma, cysts, and oral leukokeratosis. In addition, KRT17 mutations have been found in various forms of cancer, such as head and neck SCC, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no known cure for pachyonychia congenita. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and includes regular trimming of nails, avoiding pressure or friction on affected areas, and using special shoes or insoles. For cancer patients with KRT17 mutations, the treatment and prognosis vary depending on the cancer type and stage.
- **Drug Response:** The effect of KRT17 mutations on drug response is still unclear, and further studies are required to determine the role of KRT17 mutations in drug response.
