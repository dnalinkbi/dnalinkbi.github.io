# Information about Gene LZTFL1

## Genetic Position 
The gene LZTFL1 is located on chromosome 3 at position 3p21.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in LZTFL1 have been associated with several diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function for Gene
LZTFL1 is involved in regulating the trafficking of membrane proteins to the cilium, a small cellular projection found on most eukaryotic cells.
