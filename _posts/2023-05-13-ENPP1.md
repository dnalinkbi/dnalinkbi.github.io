# Gene Information for ENPP1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position:** ENPP1, also known as Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1, is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q23.2).

**Pathology:** The ENPP1 gene is associated with several metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

**Function:** The ENPP1 gene codes for a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Specifically, the ENPP1 protein inhibits insulin receptor activation, leading to insulin resistance.
