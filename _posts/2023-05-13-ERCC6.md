## Gene ERCC6

### Genetic Position
The ERCC6 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 11.23 (10q11.23).

### Pathology
Mutations in the ERCC6 gene can lead to an inherited disorder called Cockayne syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by abnormal sensitivity to sunlight, short stature, and developmental delays. 

### Function
The ERCC6 gene encodes a protein called DNA excision repair protein ERCC-6. This protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA and plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known variants in the ERCC6 gene. Some of these variants include missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and nonsense mutations. Examples of these mutations include:

- p.R109H (rs148945237)
- p.R574W (rs137853702)
- p.R701W (rs104894517)
- p.R1099* (rs398123073)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are also somatic variants in the ERCC6 gene that have been identified in various cancers. Examples of these variants include:

- c.G1615A (rs16903713)
- c.G3438A (rs3789669)
- c.T3511C (rs11546318)

### Related Disease
Mutations in the ERCC6 gene have been linked to Cockayne syndrome, as mentioned previously.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Cockayne syndrome. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications.

### Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to ERCC6 mutations.
