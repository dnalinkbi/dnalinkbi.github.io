# Information about gene CNR1

## Genomic location, Aliases, and External IDs
- Gene symbol: **CNR1**
- Other Aliases: CB1, CB1A, CB1K5, cannabinoid receptor 1 (brain), cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNSACC1)
- Chromosomal location: chromosome 6q14-q15
- Genomic position: NC_000006.12:87228831-87444368
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 2159
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 1268
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000118432
    - OMIM: 114610
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P21554

## Function
- CNR1 gene encodes the cannabinoid receptor 1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates the psychoactive effects of cannabis.
- This receptor is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in neurotransmitter release, inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and modulation of ion channel activity.
- CNR1 plays a crucial role in multiple physiological and pathological processes, such as pain sensation, appetite regulation, immune response, and mood alteration.

## AA Mutation List, Mutation Type, and dbSNP ID
- There are several missense and synonymous mutations reported in the CNR1 gene. Some common ones are:
    - rs1049353 (p.Thr453Ile)
    - rs1049358 (p.Pro77Ser)
    - rs806369 (p.Ser489Pro)
    - rs2023239 (p.Asp200Asn)
- These are Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and their effect on protein function is usually mild or benign. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations in the CNR1 gene are rare and there is limited information available on their clinical significance. 
- One reported somatic mutation in the CNR1 gene is:
    - rs1801516 (p.Thr210Met)
- This mutation is a missense mutation and its clinical significance is not yet clear.

## Related Disease
- CNR1 gene mutations have been associated with several diseases, including:
    - Neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and Huntington's disease.
    - Psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety.
    - Metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes.
- However, the exact contribution of CNR1 gene mutations to these diseases is still a matter of debate.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatments targeting CNR1 receptor are under development for various disorders, such as pain management, epilepsy, and addiction.
- Prognosis related to CNR1 mutations is not well understood as there is limited information available on clinical significance of these mutations.

## Drug Response
- CNR1 is a target for several drugs, including endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., THC and CBD).
- Variations in CNR1 gene sequence may affect drug response and treatment efficacy in some individuals.
