# Information about Gene PSMD7

## Genetic Position
The PSMD7 gene is located on the chromosomal position 16q22.1.

## Pathology
The PSMD7 gene is associated with multiple pathological conditions such as several types of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and developmental disorders.

## Function
The PSMD7 gene encodes a protein known as Proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 7. The protein is part of a large protease complex, the 26S proteasome, which is involved in the degradation of intracellular proteins. Proteasomal degradation is one of the essential mechanisms for maintaining protein homeostasis, ensuring the correct regulation of protein levels and removing damaged or misfolded proteins.
