## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No reported AA mutations in CLDN16

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No reported somatic SNVs or InDels in CLDN16

## Related Disease
- Mutations in CLDN16 are associated with familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for FHHNC. Treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms, such as magnesium and calcium supplementation, and preventing complications.
