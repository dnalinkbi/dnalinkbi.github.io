# Information about Gene CDAN3

CDAN3 gene encodes a protein called codanin-3 which is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells and erythropoiesis. Mutations in this gene lead to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III (CDA III), a rare disorder characterized by anemia and iron overload.

## Function

The CDAN3 gene encodes a protein called codanin-3 which has a role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells and erythropoiesis.

There are no somatic mutations reported in CDAN3 gene.

## Related disease

Mutations in CDAN3 gene lead to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III (CDA III), a rare disorder characterized by anemia and iron overload.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no cure for CDA III. Treatment mostly involves lifelong blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy to manage symptoms associated with anemia and iron overload. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug response

There are no known drugs specifically targeted to treat CDA III.
