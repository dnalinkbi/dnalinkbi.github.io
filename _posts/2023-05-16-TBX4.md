# Information about gene TBX4

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 17q23.2

**Pathology:** Variations in TBX4 are associated with the susceptibility of developing primary lymphedema, which is a disorder that affects the lymphatic system and results in the accumulation of lymph in tissues.

**Function for gene:** TBX4 encodes for a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of forelimbs, hindlimbs, and lungs. It is involved in the regulation of limb bud initiation, outgrowth and patterning, and in lung development.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 11635
- NCBI Entrez: 6910
- Ensembl: ENSG00000153700
- OMIM: 601719
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95931

**Aliases:** None

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Related disease:** Primary lymphedema

**Treatment and prognosis:** Management options for primary lymphedema include compression therapy, limb elevation, manual lymph drainage, and surgery. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individualâ€™s response to treatment.

**Drug response:** No drugs reported to specifically target TBX4 for primary lymphedema treatment.
