## Gene Information

The USP9Y gene is located on the Y chromosome in the q11.23 region. It codes for the ubiquitin-specific protease 9 Y-linked protein, which is a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in regulating protein degradation and turnover.

### Function for Gene
The USP9Y protein plays a role in spermatogenesis. It is responsible for the deubiquitination and stabilization of several proteins involved in this process and thus, it is important for male fertility.

### External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases
- HGNC:12694
- NCBI Entrez Gene:8287
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169047
- OMIM: 400005
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O00507

Aliases for this gene include Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP9Y, Ubiquitin Carboxyl-terminal Hydrolase 9 Y-linked, Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 9 Y-linked 1, and DFFRY.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported mutations associated with the USP9Y gene. One example is the rs1155348 variant, which results in a missense mutation changing Asparagine to Threonine at amino acid position 227 (N227T).

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the USP9Y gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the USP9Y gene have been associated with azoospermia, which is the absence of sperm in the semen leading to male infertility.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for azoospermia associated with USP9Y mutations. However, assisted reproductive technology (ART) options such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with testicular sperm retrieval can aid in conception for some couples.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug therapy for azoospermia associated with USP9Y gene mutations.
