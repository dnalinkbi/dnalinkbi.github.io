## Gene: SLIT3

### Genetic Position:
SLIT3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q35.2). It spans 583,737 base pairs of DNA and contains 43 exons.

### Pathology:
SLIT3 gene is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, neural tube defects, and sepsis.

### Function:
SLIT3 gene encodes a protein called Slit homolog 3 (SLIT3). It is involved in cell migration, axonal guidance, and angiogenesis. SLIT3 interacts with Roundabout homolog 1 (ROBO1) and ROBO2 receptors to regulate developmental processes.

### Related Diseases:
- Neural tube defects
- Cancers (breast, colorectal cancer)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no specific treatment available for SLIT3-associated conditions. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and its severity.

### Drug Response:
SLIT3 is a potential target for the treatment of various cancers. However, there are no specific drugs targeting SLIT3 currently available in the market.
