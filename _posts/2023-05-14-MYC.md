# Information about Gene MYC 

## Gene Position 
* Chromosome: 8 
* Location: 128.61 - 128.68 Mb 

## Pathology 
The MYC gene has been implicated in the development of several types of cancer including Burkitt's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and breast cancer. 

## Function
The MYC gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. It activates genes involved in DNA replication and cellular growth, and also plays a role in protein synthesis and metabolism.

## Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment and prognosis for MYC-related cancers depends on the type and stage of cancer. Some treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies that inhibit MYC activity. MYC-targeting therapies are currently in clinical trials. The prognosis varies between cancers, but in general, a MYC overexpression is associated with poorer prognosis. 

## Drug Response 
Several drugs targeting MYC are being developed, including BET inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors. However, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs that specifically target MYC.
