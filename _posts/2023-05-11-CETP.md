## Information about gene CETP

### Genetic Position
The gene CETP, which stands for Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein, is located on chromosome 16 at the position q21.1.

### Function
The CETP gene encodes a protein that plays a role in lipid metabolism. Specifically, the CETP protein facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between lipoprotein particles, which is important for the regulation of plasma lipid levels.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 1839
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 1071
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000105899
- OMIM ID: 118470
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P11597
- Aliases: BPIFD1, CETP1, HDLCQ15, LTPB1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Below is a list of amino acid mutations associated with the CETP gene, along with their mutation type and corresponding dbSNP ID (when applicable):
- D442G: Missense variant, rs1800775
- I405V: Missense variant, rs5882
- A373P: Missense variant, rs2303790
- R451Q: Missense variant, rs1801706

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the CETP gene in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
CETP has been associated with several diseases related to lipid metabolism, including:
- Atherosclerosis
- Coronary heart disease
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Hypertension
- Metabolic syndrome

### Treatment and Prognosis
Research has shown that CETP inhibition may be a potential therapy for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. Several drugs that target CETP, including anacetrapib and evacetrapib, are currently in development.

### Drug Response
Individuals with the AA genotype at the I405V variant may show a better response to lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins.
