## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** PDE4D

**Function:** Phosphodiesterase 4D is a protein-coding gene that hydrolyzes cyclic AMP to regulate various physiological processes such as inflammation, immune response, memory, and behavior.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: HGNC:8765
- NCBI Entrez: 5144
- Ensembl: ENSG00000118515
- OMIM: 600129
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q08499

**Aliases:** DPDE4, HSPDE4A, PDEIV, PDE4A, PDE4, cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D

## Mutations

**AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

The PDE4D gene shows various somatic mutations in different types of cancer. Some commonly reported mutations are:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|p.Ala206Val|Missense|rs385230763|
|p.Gln345Arg|Missense|rs113012142|
|p.Glu459_Lys460insAlaGlu|Insertion|rs1553750230|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

The PDE4D gene has been reported to have somatic SNVs/InDels in different types of cancer. Some of the significant SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs are:

- rs113012142
- rs385230763
- rs1553750230
- rs1485306340

## Related Diseases

Several mutations in the PDE4D gene have been associated with different diseases such as:

- Ischemic stroke
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Schizophrenia
- Alzheimer's disease
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no FDA-approved drug available presently that specifically targets the PDE4D gene. Several PDE inhibitors are under clinical development to treat various diseases associated with PDE4D.

## Drug Response

Some studies suggest that mutations in the PDE4D gene could contribute to variable response to drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and bronchodilators.
