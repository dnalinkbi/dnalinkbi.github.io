# Gene: APEX1

## Information
APEX1 is a gene that is located on chromosome 14 at the position 14q11.2. It encodes for the protein AP endonuclease 1, which is involved in DNA repair. It is also known by the aliases APE, APE1, APEX, HAP1, and REF1.

## Function
The APEX1 gene encodes for the protein AP endonuclease 1, which is the major mammalian enzyme involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This pathway repairs DNA damage caused by oxidation, radiation, and chemical agents. AP endonuclease 1 also plays a role in transcriptional regulation and signaling.

## Mutation Information
- AA mutation list: There are several mutations reported in the APEX1 gene. Some of the common mutations are:
    - D148E (dbSNP ID: rs1130409)
    - G241R (dbSNP ID: rs1130408)
    - R237C (dbSNP ID: rs3136814)
- Mutation type: Missense mutations
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: There are multiple somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the APEX1 gene with dbSNP IDs.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in APEX1 have been associated with various diseases, including:
- Breast cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Lung cancer
- Gastric cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Alzheimer’s disease
- Parkinson’s disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with APEX1 mutations depend on the specific disease and its severity. However, some studies have suggested that APEX1 could be a potential target for cancer therapy.

## Drug Response
Some studies have suggested that the inhibition of APEX1 activity could enhance the cytotoxicity of some anticancer agents, suggesting that APEX1 could be used as a potential target for cancer therapy.
