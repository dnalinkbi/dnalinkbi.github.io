## Gene: RFXANK

### Genetic Position
The RFXANK gene is located on chromosome 19 at the position q13.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the RFXANK gene are associated with Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS) type II. BLS is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system, leading to frequent infections. 

### Function
The RFXANK gene encodes a protein called regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin-containing protein (RFXANK), which is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes.

### Related Disease
BLS type II, also known as MHC class II deficiency, is the disease associated with RFXANK mutations.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for BLS type II. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms, such as recurrent infections, with antibiotics and immunoglobulin therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease. 

### Drug Response
There is no information available on drug response for RFXANK mutations or BLS type II.
