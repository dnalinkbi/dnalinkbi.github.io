## Gene Information

### Gene Name

ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) 

### Function

ADAM17 is a member of the ADAM family of zinc metalloproteases and is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane proteins such as growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and adhesion molecules. Its major substrates include TNF-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, and Notch ligands. ADAM17 plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation, wound healing, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

### Related Disease

ADAM17 dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions including:

* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Inflammatory bowel disease 
* Psoriasis 
* Alzheimer's disease 
* Cardiovascular disease 
* Cancer 

### Treatment and Prognosis

There are currently no FDA approved drugs that target ADAM17 for the treatment of disease. However, some small molecule inhibitors and antibodies targeting ADAM17 are undergoing pre-clinical and clinical development for various indications like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial inflammation. The prognosis of ADAM17 related diseases depends on various factors like stage of disease, genetic profile, overall health, and response to treatment.

### Drug Response

Some of the drugs that have been shown to inhibit ADAM17 activity in vitro or in vivo include:

* TNF-alpha inhibitors (e.g., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) 
* ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enalapril) 
* HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., statins)
