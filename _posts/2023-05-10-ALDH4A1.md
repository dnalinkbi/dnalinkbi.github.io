## Information about gene ALDH4A1

### Genetic Position
The ALDH4A1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the ALDH4A1 gene have been associated with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE). PDE is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by seizures that are resistant to treatment with antiepileptic drugs.

### Function for gene
The ALDH4A1 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme Î”1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase, which is involved in the catabolism of proline.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations in the ALDH4A1 gene.

### Related disease
- Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE)

### Treatment and prognosis
The mainstay of treatment for PDE is high-dose pyridoxine supplementation. With early diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis for individuals with PDE can be good, with a significant improvement in seizure control.

### Drug response
Individuals with PDE typically have a good response to pyridoxine supplementation.
