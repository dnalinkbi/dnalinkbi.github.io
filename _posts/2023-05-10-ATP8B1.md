# Information about gene ATP8B1

## Genetic Position
The ATP8B1 gene is located on chromosome 18q21.1, from base pair position 47,982,890 to 48,004,602.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene are associated with several disorders including Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1), Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP), and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC).

## Function for gene
The ATP8B1 gene encodes a membrane transporter protein involved in the transport of phospholipids and bile acids, which is critical for the normal functioning of the liver and the secretion of bile.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations reported in the ATP8B1 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene are associated with several disorders including Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1), Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP), and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC).

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment of ATP8B1-associated disorders typically involves supportive care such as administration of ursodeoxycholic acid to relieve pruritus (ICP).

## Drug response
There is limited information on drug-response testing for ATP8B1 mutations.
