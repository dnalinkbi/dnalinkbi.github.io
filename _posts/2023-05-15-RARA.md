# Gene: RARA

## Genetic Position
RARA is located on chromosome 17 at the band q21.2.

## Pathology
RARA pathologies include acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

## Function
The RARA gene encodes a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcriptional regulator. It is involved in the differentiation of various cell types including hematopoietic cells.

## Related Disease
- Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL)
- Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
APL can be treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) which target the RARA protein.

## Drug Response
APL patients who are treated with ATRA and ATO show high remission rates and improved overall survival.
