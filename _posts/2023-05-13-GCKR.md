## Information about Gene GCKR

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** Gene GCKR is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2p23.3-p24.1.

- **Pathology:** Variations in the GCKR gene have been associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Function:** The protein encoded by GCKR gene is a negative regulator of the enzyme glucokinase (GCK) which is involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. GCKR modulates the activity of GCK and regulates glucose metabolism in the liver. It also plays a role in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism.
