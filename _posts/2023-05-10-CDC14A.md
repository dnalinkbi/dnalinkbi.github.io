# Gene CDC14A

CDC14A is a protein-coding gene located on the chromosome 1p36.31. It encodes a phosphatase that belongs to the CDC14 family of dual-specificity phosphatases. CDC14A is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression.

## Function

The protein encoded by CDC14A is a member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase family. It plays a critical role in the regulation of cell division by dephosphorylating and thereby inactivating cyclin-dependent kinases. It is also involved in mRNA splicing regulation and transcriptional regulation.
