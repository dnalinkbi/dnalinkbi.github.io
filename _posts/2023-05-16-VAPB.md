## Gene: VAPB
### Information
#### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Start position: 30,949,204 bp
- End position: 31,001,541 bp

#### Function
The VAMP-associated protein B and C-terminal sequences from the highly conserved VAMP-binding region are encoded by the VAPB gene. VAPB functions as an endoplasmic reticulum protein that plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking, Ca2+ homeostasis, and lipid metabolism.

#### Related Disease
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 8 (ALS8)

#### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no definitive cure or treatment available for ALS8. Treatment can involve medications and devices to manage symptoms, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy to maintain quality of life.
- Prognosis is generally poor, as the disease progresses quickly and ultimately leads to death.
- Research into potential treatments and therapies for ALS8 is ongoing.

#### Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug response or targeted therapy available for ALS8.
