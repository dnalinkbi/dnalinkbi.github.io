## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** TRIM37

**Function:** The TRIM37 gene provides instructions for making a protein that belongs to the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, including cell signaling, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage response.

**External IDs:**

- HGNC: 12372
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 51592
- Ensembl: ENSG00000147162
- OMIM: 605533
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UM42

**Aliases:** 
- RNF64
- HHCM1
- MID2CRX

## Mutations

**AA Mutation List:** The TRIM37 gene has a total of 23 exons that encode a protein of 902 amino acids. Some of the commonly reported mutations in the TRIM37 gene include:

- c.691_721del (p.Arg231Lysfs*4)
- c.698_704del (p.Ile233Hisfs*18)
- c.350_357dup (p.Thr120Asnfs*2)

**Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:**

- c.691_721del - Frameshift deletion, dbSNP ID: rs1554719033
- c.698_704del - Frameshift deletion, dbSNP ID: rs1554719037
- c.350_357dup - Frameshift insertion, dbSNP ID: rs1554719040

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the TRIM37 gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the TRIM37 gene have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called mulibrey nanism (MUL), which affects multiple organs and systems in the body, including brain, liver, skeletal system, and heart. People with MUL have distinctive physical features, growth deficiency, and may develop various complications such as heart disease, insulin resistance, and premature death.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for mulibrey nanism, and treatment is primarily supportive and symptomatic. This may include medications for cardiac and metabolic problems, hormone replacement therapy, and growth hormone therapy. The prognosis depends on the severity and progression of the disease and may vary widely among affected individuals.

## Drug Response

There is currently no known drug for the treatment of mulibrey nanism.
