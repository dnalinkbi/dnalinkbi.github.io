# Information about Gene CSNK2A2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

CSNK2A2 (Casein Kinase 2 Alpha 2) is a gene that is located on chromosome 16 in humans. It codes for a protein called Casein Kinase 2 Alpha 2, which is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Mutations in the CSNK2A2 gene have been associated with several diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.

## Function for Gene

The CSNK2A2 gene codes for the protein Casein Kinase 2 Alpha 2, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
