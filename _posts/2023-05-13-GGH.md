# Gene GGH

## Information

- **Gene Position**: Chromosome 8 (8q12.3)
- **Function**: The GGH gene encodes for the enzyme gamma-glutamyl hydrolase that catalyzes the breakdown of glutathione, an important antioxidant in the body.

    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95479
- **Aliases**: GGH, Gamma-GT, D22S672, GGL 

## Mutations

- **AA Mutation List**: There are different amino acid mutations reported in the GGH gene including:
    - V198M
    - D464E
    - A444T
    - H204R

## Related Diseases

- The GGH gene has been associated or implicated in several diseases such as:
    - Breast cancer
    - Prostate cancer
    - Colorectal cancer
    - Alzheimer's disease
    - Parkinson's disease
    
## Treatment and Prognosis

- The treatment and prognosis of GGH-related diseases are still being studied and there is currently no standardized treatment available.

## Drug Response

- There are some drugs that may affect the activity of GGH enzyme such as methotrexate and pemetrexed that are used in chemotherapy. However, further research is still needed.
