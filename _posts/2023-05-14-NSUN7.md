## Gene: NSUN7

### Information

- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 16:49,395,788-49,459,111
- **Aliases**: NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 7, NSUN7p
- **Function**: Catalyzes the methylation of 5-carboxymethyl uridine (cm5U) at the anticodon wobble position in tRNA via S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. NSUN7 plays a crucial role in modulating translation fidelity by ensuring proper tRNA codon recognition and preventing mistranslation.
- **External IDs**:
    - HGNC: 20620
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 80149
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000196352
    - OMIM: 615845
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H6T0
