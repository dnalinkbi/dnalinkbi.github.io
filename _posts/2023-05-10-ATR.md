# Gene: ATR

## Genetic position and pathway
- ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-Related Protein) is located on chromosome 3q22.1 and contains 80 exons. It belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. ATR is involved in the DNA damage response pathway, specifically in the detection and repair of single-stranded DNA breaks.

## Function for gene
- ATR is a kinase enzyme involved in the regulation of the checkpoint pathways that maintain the stability of the genome by preventing replication and cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage. Its main function is to activate checkpoint signaling in response to DNA damage, leading to cell cycle arrest and allowing time for DNA repair.
