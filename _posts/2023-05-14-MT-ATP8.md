# Gene MT-ATP8

## Genetic Position
MT-ATP8 is a mitochondrial gene located on the heavy strand of chromosome MT (mitochondrial) at position 8,271â€“8,366.

## Pathology and Function
MT-ATP8 encodes a protein involved in the formation of ATP synthase, a complex enzyme found in the inner mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Variants in MT-ATP8 have been linked to several mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome, NARP syndrome, and neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (NARP).

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some of the amino acid mutations observed in patients with variants in MT-ATP8 include:
- A6T (dbSNP ID: rs118192693)
- Lys21del (dbSNP ID: rs1057518823)
- Arg25Cys (dbSNP ID: rs759030692)

These mutations are associated with various mitochondrial diseases.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs or InDels in MT-ATP8.

## Related Disease
MT-ATP8 variants have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome, NARP syndrome, and neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (NARP).

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for mitochondrial diseases caused by variants in MT-ATP8. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and slow down disease progression. Prognosis varies depending on disease severity and the specific variant involved.

## Drug Response
Research is ongoing to identify potential treatments for mitochondrial diseases caused by MT-ATP8 variants. One promising approach involves the use of small molecules that can increase ATP production, such as bezafibrate.
