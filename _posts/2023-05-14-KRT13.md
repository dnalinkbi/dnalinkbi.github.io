## Gene: KRT13 

- **Function:** KRT13 encodes a protein that belongs to the intermediate filament family. It is found in the suprabasal layers of stratified epithelia and is involved in maintaining cell shape and integrity. Additionally, it plays a role in differentiation, proliferation, and migration of epithelial cells. 

- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 6427 
    - Entrez Gene: 3860 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000118520 
    - OMIM: 148065 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13646 
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 17q12-q21.2 

- **Aliases:** CK-13, EBS4, EBSB, KRT4 

- **AA mutation list:** 
    - p.Arg17Cys (rs121909347) 
    - p.Asn171Asp (rs61735078) 
    - p.Thr235Met (rs61732144) 

- **Mutation type:** Missense 

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** 
    - c.1395G>A (p.Arg465His) (rs755161623) 
    - c.1279C>G (p.Pro427Ala) (rs764035732) 

- **Related disease:** Mutations in KRT13 have been associated with autosomal dominant White Sponge Nevus of Cannon (WSN) (OMIM: 193900), an inherited disorder characterized by oral white plaques that may lead to pain, infection, and chewing difficulties. 

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for WSN, however, treatment may involve the use of antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents, or antibacterial mouthwashes to prevent or treat infections. Prognosis is generally good with proper care. 

- **Drug response:** No specific drug response information is available for KRT13 mutations.
