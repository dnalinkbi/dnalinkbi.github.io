# Information about Gene PEX5

## Genetic Position:
PEX5 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q23.3).

## Pathology:
Variants in the PEX5 gene are associated with various disorders, including neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZS), and peroxisome biogenesis disorder (PBD).

## Function: 
The PEX5 gene encodes a receptor protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisomal protein import. It recognizes peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1) in newly synthesized proteins and transports them to the peroxisome for their function.

## External IDs & Aliases:
- HGNC ID: 8841
- NCBI Entrez ID: 5830
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000139567
- OMIM ID: 600414
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P50542
- Aliases: PBD3B, PXR1, PTS1BP1

## AA Mutation List:
- Missense mutations: p.Arg49Trp, p.Arg49Cys, p.Arg146Trp, p.Gly332Ser, p.Arg377Cys, p.Arg377His
- Nonsense mutations: p.Glu379*

### Mutation Type & dbSNP ID:
- rs137852122
- rs754996291
- rs137852123
- rs983019025
- rs137852124
- rs761019921

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- No somatic mutations reported in dbSNP for PEX5

## Related Diseases:
Variants in the PEX5 gene are associated with the following diseases:
- Neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD)
- Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZS)
- Peroxisome biogenesis disorder (PBD)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no cure for peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including NALD, ZS, and PBD. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive.

## Drug Response:
There is no specific drug therapy for peroxisome biogenesis disorders. However, some treatments, such as Lorenzo's oil (a mixture of oleic acid and erucic acid), dietary interventions, and other therapies, may help manage the symptoms.
