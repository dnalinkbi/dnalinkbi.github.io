# Gene Information: TMLHE 

## 1. Genetic Position
- **Chromosome:** X  
- **Genetic Position:** Xq28
- **Genetic Coordinates (GRCh38):** NC_000023.11:g.151186258-151197958

## 2. Pathology and Function
- **Function:** This gene codes for an enzyme trimethyllysine hydroxylase epsilon which catalyzes the final step in the L-carnitine biosynthesis pathway. 
- **Pathology:** Mutations in TMLHE gene causes X-linked Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is characterized by social interaction and communication problems, and restricted and repetitive behaviors.
