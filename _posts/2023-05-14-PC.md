# Information about Gene PC

## Genetic Position
- Gene symbol: PC
- Genomic location: Chromosome 21q22.3
- Pathology: Mutations in PC gene are associated with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency

## Function
- The PC gene encodes for an enzyme called pyruvate carboxylase, which is involved in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis.
