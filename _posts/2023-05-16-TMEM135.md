# Gene Information for TMEM135

## Gene Position
**TMEM135** gene is located on the **chromosome 17q12**.

## Gene Function
The protein encoded by the *TMEM135* gene is a transmembrane protein that is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial function.

## External IDs
- HGNC ID: **28702**
- NCBI Entrez ID: **137078**
- Ensembl ID: **ENSG00000108451**
- OMIM ID: **615319**
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: **Q6NUK1**

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.D322N [rs201621447]: This is a missense variant, which substitutes the 322nd amino acid Aspartic acid with Asparagine.
- p.G331R [rs769865244]: This is another missense variant that affects the 331st amino acid Glycine, which is substituted with Arginine.
- p.E167* [rs201137449]: This variant results in a premature stop codon at position 167.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no information available on the somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for *TMEM135* gene.

## Related Disease
Research has determined that mutations in TMEM135 gene can lead to an autosomal recessive form of mitochondrial disease called *encephalopathy, respiratory failure, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes* (**MIM: 615453**).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no definitive cure for the mitochondrial diseases caused by TMEM135 mutations. However, patients may benefit from the intake of some dietary supplements, such as vitamins and cofactors. There is currently no available information about the prognosis.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug therapy available for this mitochondrial disease.
