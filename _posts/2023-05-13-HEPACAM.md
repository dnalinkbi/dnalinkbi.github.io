# Information about Gene HEPACAM

### Genetic Position

The HEPACAM gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q24.1). 

### Pathology

Mutations in HEPACAM are associated with several types of cancer, including breast, liver, and gastric cancer.

### Function for Gene 

HEPACAM encodes a protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. While the exact function of this protein is not yet fully understood, it is thought to be involved in cell adhesion and migration.
