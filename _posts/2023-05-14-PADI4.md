### Gene Information

**Gene:** PADI4

**Function:** PADI4 (Peptidyl arginine deiminase, type IV) is an enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational conversion of peptidylarginine to citrulline, a process known as citrullination. This process has been linked to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases.

**External IDs:** 

- HGNC: 8564 
- NCBI Entrez: 23569 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138772
- OMIM: 605746 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UM07

**Genomic location:** Chromosome 1q36.13

**Aliases:** PAD4, PADI5, PDI4

### Mutations

**AA mutation:** The missense mutation rs1748033 causes a substitution of arginine to histidine at position 281 (R281H) of the PADI4 protein.

**Mutation type:** Missense Mutation

**dbSNP ID:** rs1748033

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** There are no somatic mutations reported for PADI4 in COSMIC database as of August 2021.

### Related Disease

PADI4 has been associated with various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The R281H variant of the PADI4 gene has been found to be associated with the development of RA.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for PADI4 gene mutations. However, targeting citrullination pathways has been proposed as a possible approach to treat autoimmune diseases associated with PADI4.

### Drug Response

There is no evidence regarding drug response related to PADI4 gene mutations.
