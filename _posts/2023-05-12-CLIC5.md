## Gene: CLIC5
#### Genetic Position
The gene CLIC5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 between positions 21.31 and 22.1.

#### Pathology and Function
The CLIC5 gene encodes a chloride intracellular channel protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, playing a crucial role in the maintenance of ionic balance and cytoplasmic pH in various tissues. Mutations or dysregulated expression of CLIC5 can lead to pathological conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy and deafness.
