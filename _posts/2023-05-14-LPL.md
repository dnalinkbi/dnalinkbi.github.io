# Gene: LPL

## General Information
- Function: LPL encodes for the lipoprotein lipase enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in circulating chylomicrons and VLDLs. The enzyme is synthesized in myocytes and adipocytes and then transported to the luminal surface of the endothelium where it cleaves the triglycerides present in VLDL to provide energy to adipose tissue and muscle.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- The dbSNP database lists several variations in LPL, including missense and nonsense mutations. The most common variants are listed below:
    - rs1801177: A to C transition in exon 8, leading to a substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 9 (D9N).
    - rs13702: G to A transition in exon 5, leading to a substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 194 (I194V).
    - rs328: A to C transition in exon 2, leading to a substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at position 23 (E23K).
    - rs1608253: C to T transition in exon 6, leading to a substitution of alanine for valine at position 278 (V278A).
    - rs11227817: G to A transition in the intronic region.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic mutations listed in the COSMIC database for LPL.
- The most common ones are:
    - COSM979: G to A transition in exon 5, leading to a substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 194 (I194V).
    - COSM6149: T to C transition in exon 8, leading to a substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 9 (D9N).
    - COSM32202: G to A transition in exon 2, leading to a substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at position 23 (E23K).

## Related Disease
- Mutations in LPL have been associated with several disorders, including:
    - Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency
    - Hypertriglyceridemia
    - Type 2 diabetes
    - Metabolic syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment for disorders associated with LPL mutations includes a combination of lifestyle changes and drugs to control lipid levels.
- The prognosis depends on the severity of the disorder and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
- Several drugs have been used to manage disorders associated with LPL mutations, including fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and statins.
