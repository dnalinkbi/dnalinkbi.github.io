# Gene Information: ALG9

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11

**Pathology:** ALG9 mutations are associated with congential disorder of glycosylation type 1L (CDG1L) which is characterized by variable neurological involvement, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, skeletal dysplasia, and impaired vision. 

**Function:** ALG9 encodes for an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase enzyme which is responsible for adding the ninth mannose to the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide during N-linked protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 403
- NCBI Entrez: 79175
- Ensembl: ENSG00000110321
- OMIM: 606941
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6GQQ9

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg262Ter - nonsense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs137852816)
- p.Lys283Glu - missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs200873963)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for ALG9.

**Related Disease:** Congential disorder of glycosylation type 1L (CDG1L)

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no known cure for CDG1L, but treatment options focus on managing the symptoms of the disease such as physical therapy, hormone replacement therapy, and vision support. Prognosis varies based on the severity of the symptoms. 

**Drug Response:** Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeted towards treating ALG9 mutations.
