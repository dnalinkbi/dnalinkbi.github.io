## Gene LIPI

### Genetic Position
The LIPI gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position q25.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the LIPI gene have been linked to several diseases including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

### Function
The LIPI gene encodes a protein that plays a role in lipid metabolism and energy storage.
