## Gene GIP

### Genetic Position
Gene GIP is located on chromosome 17 at position 17q21.2. 

### Pathology
GIP is associated with several diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. 

### Function 
GIP encodes the human gastric inhibitory polypeptide, which is a hormone that stimulates insulin secretion in response to meals, hence regulating glucose homeostasis. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 4297
- NCBI Entrez: 2697
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109072
- OMIM: 137240
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09681
- Aliases: GIP, GIP1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide 

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- rs2291725: Val-Asp substitution (V42D) 
- rs1800437: Gln-Ala substitution (Q98H)
- rs2302382: Ser-Leu substitution (S102L) 
- rs1800436: Ala-Val substitution (A87V) 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No significant somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported so far.

### Related Disease
Abnormal levels of GIP have been reported to be associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for gastro inhibitory polypeptide deficiency. However, drugs that mimic the function of GIP by stimulating insulin secretion are in development.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response study associated with GIP.
