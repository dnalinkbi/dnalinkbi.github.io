## Information on PDHA1 gene

The PDHA1 gene is located on chromosome Xq13.1 and encodes pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 subunit, which is an essential component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC plays a vital role in converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a critical step in cellular energy production through the citric acid cycle.

### Function
PDHA1 is responsible for catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, which allows it to enter the citric acid cycle and produce ATP, the cellular energy source.

### Related disease
Mutations in the PDHA1 gene are associated with X-linked pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency, which is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by a buildup of lactic acid in the blood, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and other neurological symptoms. 

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for PDC deficiency, and treatment is focused on managing the symptoms. Treatments such as a ketogenic diet, antioxidant therapy, and cofactor supplementation can help in controlling some of the symptoms. The severity of the disease varies, but it is typically a lifelong condition that can affect the patient's daily life activities.

### Drug response
There have been some reports of thiamine supplementation and dichloroacetate therapy resulting in improvement of symptoms in some patients with PDHA1 deficiency. However, more research is required to determine the full extent of their efficacy.
