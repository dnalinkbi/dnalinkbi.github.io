# Genetic information analysis report for gene LRIG3

## Basic Information
- Gene Symbol: LRIG3
- Gene ID: 84887
- Chromosomal Location: 12q13.12
- Alias: LIG3, LIRG3, LHFP, LIG-3

## Function
The LRIG3 gene provides instructions for making a protein which is a member of the LRIG (Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains) family. The exact function of this protein is not completely understood, but it may play a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation.
