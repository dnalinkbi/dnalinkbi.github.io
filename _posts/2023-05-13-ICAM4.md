# Gene: ICAM4

## Genetic Position
ICAM4 gene (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 4) is located on chromosome 19 at position p13.3.

## Pathology
ICAM4 is associated with various pathological conditions such as sickle cell anemia, ischemic stroke, and acute chest syndrome.

## Function
ICAM4 encodes a member of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) family, which plays a crucial role in immune cell trafficking and adhesion. ICAM4 is specifically expressed on red blood cells (RBCs) and plays an important role in erythroblast enucleation (the process by which the nucleus of the erythroblast is removed to form mature RBCs).
