## Gene: FTO

### Function

The FTO gene encodes for a demethylase enzyme that plays a role in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and energy homeostasis in mammals. Several studies have linked FTO gene expression levels to obesity and metabolic syndrome.

### External IDs and Genomic location

The official gene symbol for FTO is FTO, and it is located on the chromosomal region 16q12.2. 
Other aliases for this gene include Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase FTO, Fat mass and obesity-associated protein, and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some of the non-synonymous mutations in the FTO gene along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID are listed below:

|Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|-------------|--------|
|p.Arg316Gln|Missense|rs17817449|
|p.Thr379Ala|Missense|rs1421085|
|p.Ala186Thr|Missense|rs1421080|
|p.Glu266Lys|Missense|rs1477196|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

There have been reports of somatic SNVs and InDels in the FTO gene associated with a few cancers. Here are some examples with their dbSNP IDs:

|Mutation|dbSNP ID|Cancer type|
|--------|--------|----------|
|p.Asp243Tyr|rs150592665|Breast cancer|
|p.Arg360Cys|rs373422126|Gastrointestinal stromal tumor|

### Related disease

Mutations and variations in the FTO gene have been associated with a predisposition to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Rare mutations in FTO gene have also been associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, particularly in females.

### Treatment and prognosis

At present, there are no specific treatments for FTO gene mutations or variations. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise and a balanced diet may help mitigate the impact of such genetic variations.

### Drug response

As of now, there are no drugs targeting the FTO gene directly. Some studies have suggested that variants in the FTO gene could influence the effectiveness of certain drugs used in the treatment of metabolic diseases.
