# Information about gene BMPR1A

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

**BMPR1A** is a gene located on chromosome 10q22.3. Mutations or alterations in this gene can lead to various disorders, including juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS), and colorectal cancer (CRC). 

**Function for gene**

BMPR1A encodes for a protein called bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A, which plays a crucial role in the signaling pathway of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). This pathway is involved in various cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**

One of the common BMPR1A mutations associated with JPS is a frameshift mutation caused by a 2-bp deletion in exon 11. This mutation leads to a premature stop codon and a truncated protein. 

More mutations in this gene can be found in the dbSNP database ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

The following somatic mutations have been reported in the dbSNP database:

- rs104893755 (c.1948C>T) - associated with CRC
- rs104893753 (c.1012C>G) - associated with gastric cancer
- rs794725436 (c.1519C>T) - associated with colorectal adenoma

**Related disease**

Mutations or alterations in BMPR1A have been linked to various disorders, including:

- Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)
- Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS)
- Colorectal cancer (CRC)
- Gastric cancer
- Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII)

**Treatment and prognosis**

Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disorder associated with the BMPR1A mutation. In general, treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, or targeted therapies. The prognosis can also vary greatly depending on the specific condition and stage of the disease at diagnosis. 

**Drug response**

There is limited information on drug response and BMPR1A mutations. However, some studies have suggested that targeting the BMP signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic approach for tumors associated with BMPR1A alterations.
