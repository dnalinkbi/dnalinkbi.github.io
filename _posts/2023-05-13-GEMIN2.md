# Information about Gene GEMIN2

## Genetic Position
GEMIN2 is located on chromosome 12q24.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GEMIN2 gene have been associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder that affects the control of muscle movement.

## Function
GEMIN2 encodes a protein called Gem-associated protein 2 (Gemin2), which is a component of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex that is essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA in the nucleus. Gemin2 plays a crucial role in the assembly of the snRNP complex and is required for the splicing of many genes, including those involved in motor neuron function.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations reported in the GEMIN2 gene with their corresponding mutation type and dbSNP ID. Some of them are mentioned below.

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| E97A | Missense | rs3735648 |
| R368W | Missense | rs121918216 |
| R368Q | Missense | rs786204380 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the GEMIN2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the GEMIN2 gene are associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. SMA is caused by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and is classified into several subtypes, depending on the age of onset and severity of symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for SMA, and treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. There are several drugs in development that aim to increase production of the SMN protein, which is deficient in SMA patients. Prognosis depends on the severity of the disease, subtype, and individual patient factors.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs currently known to specifically target GEMIN2, however, drugs targeting SMN protein are being developed, which could indirectly impact Gemin2 function.
