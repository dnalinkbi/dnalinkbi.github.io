## Gene Information

### Gene Name and Alias
NEIL2 (Nei Like DNA Glycosylase 2)

### Gene Function 
NEIL2 is a DNA glycosylase enzyme that is involved in the base excision repair pathway. It recognizes and removes oxidized bases, such as thymine glycol and 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine, from damaged DNA.

### Genomic Location and External IDs
- Genomic Position: Chromosome 8: 56,588,776-56,603,242
- HGNC ID: 17814
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 55557
- Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000120907
- OMIM ID: 608642
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q969P1

### AA Mutation List
| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L83F | Missense | rs121912807 |
| E181G | Missense | rs149574978 |
| K243E | Missense | rs41311150 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are several somatic variants reported for NEIL2 gene in COSMIC: 

- c.478C>T, p.Arg160Ter, COSM6236943
- c.328T>A, p.Ile90Ser, COSM8550557

### Related Disease
Recent studies have shown that NEIL2 may be associated with the development of certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments for NEIL2 related diseases. However, some studies have suggested that NEIL2 may be a potential prognostic marker for cancer patients.

### Drug Response
There is limited information regarding the drug response of NEIL2-related diseases.
