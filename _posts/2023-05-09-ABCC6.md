# Information about Gene ABCC6

## Gene Position
The gene ABCC6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at position 16p13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the ABCC6 gene have been associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an inherited disorder that affects the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system.

## Function
The ABCC6 gene encodes a transmembrane transporter protein that is primarily expressed in the liver. This protein is involved in the transport of compounds including vitamin K and ATP across the cell membrane.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 368
- Genomic Location: chr16:1,839,746-1,929,329
- HGNC: 60
- NCBI Entrez: 368
- Ensembl: ENSG00000125373
- OMIM: 603234
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95255

Aliases: PXE, ARC3, ABCC6D, ABCI11

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several missense mutations have been reported in ABCC6 gene. Some of them are:
- p.R1141X (rs61755330)
- p.R1268Q (rs150874126)
- p.R1314W (rs121908665)
- p.R1339C (rs121908666)
- p.G1321E (rs146715352)
- p.G1158D (rs149860387)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there is no record of somatic SNVs/InDels in the ABCC6 gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for PXE. Treatment involves managing symptoms and complications. Regular medical check-ups and eye exams are advised for patients with PXE.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically approved for treatment of PXE. However, several drugs such as bisphosphonates, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate and magnesium oxide have been tested to reduce progression of PXE.
