## Gene GK

### Genetic Position
Gene GK is located on chromosome 3 at position 3p21.31.

### Pathology and Function
The GK gene encodes for the enzyme glucokinase, which is responsible for catalyzing the first step in the utilization of glucose by the cell. Mutations in the GK gene have been associated with the development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 2.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the GK gene have been associated with the development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 2.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Patients with MODY type 2 are usually treated with sulfonylureas or insulin injections to regulate their blood glucose levels. Prognosis for patients with MODY type 2 is generally good with proper management of blood glucose levels.

### Drug Response
Sulfonylureas have been found to be an effective treatment option for patients with MODY type 2.
