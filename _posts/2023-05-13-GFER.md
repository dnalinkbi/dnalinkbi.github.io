# Information about Gene GFER

## Genetic Position
Gene GFER is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.3). It is approximately 29.12 Mb in size and contains 14 exons.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GFER gene have been implicated in several diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Friedreich ataxia, and Leigh syndrome.

## Function
The GFER gene encodes the protein 'glia maturation factor-beta' (GMFB), which is known to regulate the differentiation and maturation of glial cells in the nervous system. It has also been found to be important in mitochondrial biogenesis and function.

## External IDs and Aliases

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the GFER gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Here are some examples:
- p.Arg340Gln (rs121912699)
- p.Glu10Lys (rs150431487)
- p.Gly37Arg (rs137852757)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information on somatic mutations in the GFER gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the GFER gene have been associated with a variety of diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Friedreich ataxia, and Leigh syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for diseases caused by GFER gene mutations. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and complications associated with the disease.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response for diseases caused by GFER gene mutations.
