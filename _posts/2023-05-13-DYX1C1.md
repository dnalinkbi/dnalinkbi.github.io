## Gene: DYX1C1

### Genetic Position
DYX1C1 is located on chromosome 15q21.3.

### Pathology
DYX1C1 has been associated with developmental dyslexia, a highly heritable disorder characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and reading comprehension despite normal intelligence, motivation, and schooling.

### Function
The function of DYX1C1 is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in neuronal migration and differentiation in the developing brain.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for DYX1C1.

### Related Disease
DYX1C1 has been associated with developmental dyslexia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
As of now, there is no cure for developmental dyslexia. However, there are interventions that can improve reading ability and comprehension in those with the disorder.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug for the treatment of developmental dyslexia.
