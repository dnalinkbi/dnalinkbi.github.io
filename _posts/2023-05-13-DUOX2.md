## Gene DUOX2

- **Function for gene:** DUOX2 (Dual oxidase 2) is a gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for the production of hydrogen peroxide in the thyroid gland, which is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

   - **External IDs:** 
     - HGNC: 20964
     - NCBI Entrez: 53830
     - Ensembl: ENSG00000154739
     - OMIM: 606759
     - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NRD9

   - **Genomic location:** Chromosome 15q15.3-q21.1
   
   - **Aliases:** THOX2, DUOXA2, LNOX2, bA125A24.2, p1384

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

   - c.2533G>A (p.Glu845Lys) - rs61752412
   - c.2512T>C (p.Met838Thr) - rs72552282
   - c.2660A>G (p.Lys887Arg) - rs146686890
   
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

   - c.738_741delAACT (p.Asn247Thrfs*2) - rs398124364 
   - c.3572C>T (p.Arg1191*) - rs138718027

- **Related Diseases:** DUOX2 mutations have been associated with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and thyroid dyshormonogenesis.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Patients with DUOX2 mutations causing CH require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy to prevent intellectual disability and growth retardation.

- **Drug Response:** 

   - Sodium levothyroxine is the drug of choice for the management of CH due to DUOX2 mutations. 
   - Many studies have shown that the dose of levothyroxine required to maintain euthyroidism in patients with DUOX2 mutations is higher than that required in patients with thyroid dysgenesis.
