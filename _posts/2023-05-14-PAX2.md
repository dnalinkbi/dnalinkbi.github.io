# Gene Information for PAX2

## Gene Position
The PAX2 gene is located on chromosome 10 at position p11.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PAX2 gene have been associated with various disorders including:
- Optic nerve coloboma
- Renal hypoplasia/aplasia
- Vesicoureteral reflux
- Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)

## Function
The PAX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the kidneys, urinary tract, eyes, and central nervous system.
