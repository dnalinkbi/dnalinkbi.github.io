# Genetic Information of Gene BRCA2

## Gene Information
- Function: The BRCA2 gene is involved in DNA repair, particularly in homologous recombination mediated DNA repair.

- External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:
    - Gene ID: 675
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 13q13.1
    - Aliases: Breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein, FANCD1, FACD, XRCC11

## Mutation Information:
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.2808delA: frameshift (pathogenic), rs80359536
    - c.5454C>T: missense (likely pathogenic), rs804271002
    - c.1310_1313delTTAA: frameshift (pathogenic), rs80359527
    - c.8764_8765insGT: frameshift (pathogenic), rs80359574
    - c.3036_3039delTTAA: frameshift (likely pathogenic), rs398123010

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - Not available

## Related Disease:
- Breast cancer type 2 (BRCA2-related breast cancer)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment of BRCA2-related breast cancer involves surgery such as mastectomy or oophorectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
- Patients with BRCA2-related breast cancer usually have a higher survival rate than those with BRCA1-related breast cancer.

## Drug Response:
- Several PARP inhibitors (PARPi) such as Olaparib, Talazoparib, and Rucaparib are used to treat BRCA1/2-mutated advanced ovarian and breast cancers.
