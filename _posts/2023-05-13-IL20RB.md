## Gene: IL20RB

### Gene Function:

IL20RB (Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta) is a protein-coding gene. It encodes a subunit of the receptor for interleukin 20. The protein belongs to the type II cytokine receptor family and is involved in signaling pathways associated with cytokine and growth factor signaling.

### Gene Information:
- External IDs: HGNC: 14039, NCBI Entrez: 53834, Ensembl: ENSG00000100961, OMIM: 606379, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NEF4
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 3q27.1
- Aliases: CRF2-8, IL-20RB, PRO2909 

### AA Mutation List:
- No significant mutations reported

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- No significant somatic SNVs/InDels reported

### Related Disease:
- Psoriasis: IL20RB is a susceptibility gene for psoriasis. 

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- The exact treatment for psoriasis based on the genetics of IL20RB is not available. However, several medications, including topical corticosteroids and biologics, have been effective in treating psoriasis symptoms in most people.

### Drug Response:
- Infliximab: A study on the efficacy of infliximab in psoriasis patients suggested that patients with a specific variant in the IL20RB gene (rs1495965) have a better response to infliximab treatment.
