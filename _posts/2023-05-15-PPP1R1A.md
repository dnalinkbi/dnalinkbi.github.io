## Gene: PPP1R1A

### Information

#### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: 17q12

#### Pathology
PPP1R1A has been linked to various diseases including:
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar disorder
- Drug addiction
- Cocaine addiction
- Parkinson's disease
- Human cancers

#### Function
PPP1R1A encodes for a dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32). DARPP-32 is a central regulator of dopaminergic neurotransmission that affects the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease.
