# Information about Gene NDUFAF1

## Genetic Position
The gene NDUFAF1 is located on chromosome 2 at position 2p16.3.

## Pathology
Variations in NDUFAF1 gene have been related to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a rare genetic disease that affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain and leads to various clinical symptoms such as neuromuscular, developmental, and metabolic dysfunction.

## Function
The NDUFAF1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I. The protein is specifically responsible for the incorporation of subunits into the complex.
