## Gene DMD

### Basic Information
- **Function**: The DMD (dystrophin) gene provides instructions for making the protein dystrophin, which is primarily found in muscles used for movement (skeletal and cardiac muscles).
- **Aliases**: BMD, DXS142, DXS164, DXS206, DXS268, DXS269, DXS270, DXS272, DXS273, DXS7, MGC116817, MGC116818, MTM, MTM1, ATP1A3, EYS, RP11-485F22.1
- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome X: 31,441,990 - 33,311,968
- **External IDs**: HGNC:2928, NCBI Entrez:1756, Ensembl:ENSG00000198947, OMIM:300377, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P11532

### Mutations and Variations
- **AA Mutation List**: The DMD gene is large, consisting of 79 exons that span more than 2 million DNA base pairs. The gene is prone to mutations, resulting in a range of inherited muscle disorders, which are collectively called dystrophinopathies. There are numerous mutations that have been identified in this gene, causing various types of dystrophinopathies. A comprehensive list of mutations can be found in the Leiden Muscular Dystrophy pages ([Click](https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/DMD).)
- **Mutation Types with dbSNP ID**: DMD gene mutations can include frameshift deletions/insertions, nonsense mutations, splice-site mutations, and missense mutations, among others. dbSNP ([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)) provides RS numbers for known genetic variations within the DMD gene.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Somatic mutations in the DMD gene can cause certain cancers, such as breast cancer. dbSNP provides RS numbers for known genetic variations within the DMD gene that are associated with somatic mutations.
 
### Related Diseases
- **Related Diseases**: Mutations in the DMD gene are associated with a range of inherited muscle disorders, including Duchenne (DMD), Becker (BMD), and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM). DMD is the most severe form and usually appears in early childhood, while BMD is a less severe form and generally appears in adolescence or early adulthood. XLDCM affects the heart, leading to heart failure in males in their teenage years or early twenties.
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no cure for dystrophinopathies. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms and delaying disease progression. This may include physical therapy, assisted ventilation, and medication. Prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the dystrophinopathy.
- **Drug Response**: There are several potential therapies in development for dystrophinopathies, including gene therapy and exon skipping technology. Corticosteroids are often used to slow disease progression, but long-term use can lead to side effects such as osteoporosis, weight gain, and high blood pressure.
