# Information about gene LRTOMT

## Genetic Position
- Gene: LRTOMT (leucine rich transmembrane and O-methyltransferase)
- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11q13.4
- Strand: -
- Pathology: Mutations in LRTOMT can cause deafness.

## Function
LRTOMT gene codes for an O-methyltransferase enzyme that is involved in protein-protein interactions and regulates the function of various ion channels. It is specifically expressed in the cochlea of the inner ear, where it plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of hair cells responsible for hearing.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|----------|
| p.Ala104Ser | Missense | rs61737925 |
| p.Ala109Val | Missense | rs121908069 |
| p.Thr977Ala | Missense | rs374738466 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic mutations in LRTOMT gene.

## Related disease
Mutations in LRTOMT gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB63).

## Treatment and prognosis
At present, there is no definitive cure for hearing loss caused by LRTOMT mutations. However, hearing aids and cochlear implants can help improve communication ability and maintain the quality of life of affected individuals.

## Drug response
There is currently no established information on drug response related to LRTOMT gene mutations.
