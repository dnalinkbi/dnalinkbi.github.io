## Gene CAV1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7: 25,127,376 - 25,153,126 

**Function for Gene:** CAV1 belongs to the caveolin family of proteins that function as scaffolding proteins within caveolae plasma membrane invaginations. It also regulates various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cholesterol homeostasis, and endocytosis.

**Related Disease:** Caveolinopathies, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Schizophrenia

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis of CAV1-related diseases vary depending on the specific disorder. Some patients may have a mild phenotype, while others have a more severe clinical presentation.

**Drug Response:** Some studies have suggested that certain drugs such as statins may modulate the function of CAV1, while others have shown that the overexpression of CAV1 may enhance the uptake and activity of chemotherapeutic agents.
