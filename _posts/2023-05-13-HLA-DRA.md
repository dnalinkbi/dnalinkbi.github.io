# Gene Information

The HLA-DRA gene provides instructions for making a protein that combines with another protein to form a receptor complex on the surface of certain immune system cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This receptor complex helps the immune system recognize foreign substances and trigger an immune response.

## Function
The protein made by HLA-DRA gene is involved in presenting foreign substances (antigens) to immune cells, which in turn stimulates the immune response. It plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response.

## External IDs and Location
- Gene ID: 3122
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 6p21.32
- External IDs: HGNC:4947, NCBI Gene: 3122, Ensembl: ENSG00000196126, OMIM: 142860, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01903

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.His52Arg - rs3891514
- p.His55Tyr - rs9271058

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No significant somatic SNVs/InDels reported yet.

## Related Disease
Variations in the HLA-DRA gene are associated with autoimmune disease, including multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no particular treatment available for variations in the HLA-DRA gene. Treatment is focused on managing the specific symptoms and consequences of the related diseases.

## Drug Response
The HLA-DRA gene is involved in drug metabolism and response to certain drugs, including tacrolimus and cyclosporine. Variations in this gene can affect the efficacy of these drugs.
