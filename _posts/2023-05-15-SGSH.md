## Gene SGSH
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 17q25.3
- **Function:** Encodes for an enzyme called N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, which is involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in cells. 
- **External IDs and Aliases:**
     - HGNC: 10837
     - NCBI Entrez: 6449
     - Ensembl: ENSG00000108384
     - OMIM: 605270
     - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6TGC8
  
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
     - c.903C>T (missense mutation, rs1126809) 
     - c.1344+1G>A (splicing, rs121908832)
     - c.118_119delCT (frameshift mutation, rs786204705)
     
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
     - No known somatic mutations. 
     
- **Related disease:** Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A. This is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the SGSH gene, leading to the accumulation of heparan sulfate in cells. The disease affects the central nervous system and leads to severe neurological impairment, developmental delay, and early death.
     
- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for MPS IIIA, and treatment options are limited to supportive care and management of symptoms. Gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy have shown promise in preclinical studies and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Prognosis for affected individuals is generally poor, with a significantly shortened life expectancy. 

- **Drug response:** There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of MPS IIIA. Various small molecule compounds and gene therapy approaches are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies.
