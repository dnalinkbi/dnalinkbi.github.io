# Information about Gene KIF1B

## Gene Position
Gene KIF1B is located on chromosome 1 in the genomic position of 1p36.22-p36.21.

## Pathology
The loss of KIF1B function may lead to a higher risk of developing cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

## Function
The KIF1B gene encodes a protein called kinesin family member 1B (KIF1B). This protein is a motor protein that moves along microtubules in cells and helps transport molecules and organelles within the cell.

- OMIM: 605995
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60333

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported in the KIF1B gene. Some of which are:
- p.S67L, missense mutation, with dbSNP ID: rs77578723
- p.L98P, missense mutation, with dbSNP ID: rs74781916
- p.P162L, missense mutation, with dbSNP ID: rs145994184
- p.L205S, missense mutation, with dbSNP ID: rs1057520735

- c.1093G>A, with dbSNP ID: rs769596754
- c.1787A>G, with dbSNP ID: rs35615072
- c.556T>G, with dbSNP ID: rs140150796

## Related Disease
The mutations in the KIF1B gene are associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options and prognosis for KIF1B gene mutations depend on the related disease. Further research is needed to develop specific treatments for mutations in this gene.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response of mutations in KIF1B gene.
