# Information about gene IFRD1

## Genetic Position
The IFRD1 gene is located on chromosome 7 at the position q32.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the IFRD1 gene are not commonly associated with any specific genetic disorders or diseases. However, dysregulation of the gene has been linked to various pathological processes, such as cancer progression, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

## Function
The IFRD1 gene encodes for Interferon-Related Developmental Regulator 1 protein, which is involved in a wide range of cellular processes including chromosome organization, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. The protein has also been implicated in various signaling pathways, such as ERK/MAPK, p53, and TNF-Î±.

| rs3740323 | Val81Ile | Missense |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs and InDels that have been identified in the IFRD1 gene. Some of the common ones are:

| SNP ID | AA mutation | Mutation Type |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| rs26722 | c.-127C>G | 5' UTR |
| rs2069779 | c.-103A>G | 5' UTR |
| rs3729847 | c.-98C>T | 5' UTR |

## Related Diseases
Dysregulation of the IFRD1 gene has been associated with various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, asthma, and neurodegeneration.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment available for mutations in the IFRD1 gene. However, it can be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker for certain diseases.

## Drug Response
There is limited research on the drug response of mutations in the IFRD1 gene. However, it has been suggested that the protein could be targeted for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases.
