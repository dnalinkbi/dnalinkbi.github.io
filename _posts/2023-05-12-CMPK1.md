## Gene: CMPK1

### Genomic Position
- Chromosome:  CMPK1 is located in Chromosome 1
- Genomic coordinates: 153,826,955-153,874,221 
- Strand: Minus strand (1-)

### Pathology 
CMPK1 mutations are associated with Barrett Esophagus
(CMPK1 was identified as a putative tumor suppressor)

 ### Function 
CMPK1 (Cytidine/Deoxycytidine Monophosphate Kinase 1) is a protein-coding gene. CMPK1 plays a crucial role in synthesizing DNA by catalyzing the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of cytidine monophosphate (CMP) to form CDP (cytidine diphosphate) and CTP (cytidine triphosphate) to form dCTP (deoxycytidine triphosphate).

### Related Disease
- Barrett Esophagus 

### Treatment and Prognosis
The current treatment for Barrett Esophagus involves the use of medications to control acid reflux, which can help to prevent or treat the inflammation in the esophagus. In severe cases, surgery may be required. The prognosis for individuals with Barrett Esophagus is generally good, but it is important to continue monitoring the condition to prevent the development of esophageal cancer.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with CMPK1 mutations
