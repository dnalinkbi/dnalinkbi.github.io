# Gene information for ABCB4

## Gene Function

The ABCB4 gene encodes a protein called multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3), which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is involved in the transport of phosphatidylcholine from the hepatocytes (liver cells) to the bile canaliculi, which is crucial in the formation and secretion of bile.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

- No somatic mutations were found in the ABCB4 gene

## Related Disease

Mutations in the ABCB4 gene have been linked to several liver diseases, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), which is characterized by cholestasis, pruritus, and jaundice; and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), which is characterized by intermittent episodes of cholestasis. Mutations in ABCB4 have also been associated with gallbladder cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments for PFIC3 or BRIC1, and the prognosis for these diseases varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the individual patient. In some cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response related to ABCB4 mutations. However, studies have suggested that patients with ABCB4 mutations may be less responsive to traditional treatments for cholestasis, such as ursodeoxycholic acid.
