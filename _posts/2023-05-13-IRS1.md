## Information about Gene IRS1

### Genomic Position, Pathology and Function:
- **Gene**: IRS1 (Insulin Receptor Substrate 1)
- **Pathology**: Null Mutations associated with insulin resistance, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
- **Function**: IRS1 plays an essential role in insulin signaling pathway. It acts as an adaptor protein and upon phosphorylation gets activated and binds to several intracellular signaling molecules involved in insulin signaling cascade. It also plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, macrophage migration, inflammation, and cognitive functions.

### Gene ID, Genomic Location, and Aliases
- **Gene ID**: 3667
- **Genomic Location**: 2p36.1
- **Aliases**: IRS-1, pp185, IRS-1A

### External IDs
- **HGNC**: 6121
- **NCBI Entrez**: 3667
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000130827
- **OMIM**: 147545
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P35568

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ala513Thr (rs1805097)
- p.Gly319Ser (rs1805098)
- p.Gly972Arg (rs1801278)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not available as IRS1 mutation pattern is germline inheritable

### Related Disease
- Insulin resistance
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- Metabolic syndrome 
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Neurodegenerative disorders 

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment is based on insulin-sensitizing agents like metformin, pioglitazone, troglitazone, and rosiglitazone. Lifestyle modifications also help in reducing insulin resistance.
- Prognosis can be poor if insulin resistance remains untreated. It may lead to type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic abnormalities.

### Drug Response
- Pioglitazone has shown to be effective in reducing insulin resistance in many studies, reviews, and trials.
