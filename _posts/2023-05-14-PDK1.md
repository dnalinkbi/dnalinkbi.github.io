# Information about Gene PDK1

## Gene Position
The PDK1 gene is located on chromosome 16 at the position q22.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PDK1 gene have been associated with certain types of cancer.

## Function
The PDK1 gene encodes a protein called 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1. This protein plays an important role in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the PDK1 gene have been associated with various types of cancer including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of PDK1-associated cancer varies depending on the specific type and stage of the cancer.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting PDK1 available for clinical use.
