## Information about gene BMPER:

### Genetic Position:
- BMPER gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7, specifically in the region 7p21.1-p14.1.
- The gene spans a genomic region of about 142 kilobases.

### Pathology:
- Mutations in BMPER gene have been associated with different pathological conditions such as:
    - Diaphragmatic Hernia (DH).
    - Metastatic Osteosarcoma.
    - Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
    - Ovarian Cancer.

### Function:
- BMPER gene encodes for a protein called BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER).
- BMPER is a secreted protein that functions as a modulator of different signaling pathways.
- BMPER interacts with Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and regulates their activity, affecting different cellular processes such as angiogenesis and endothelial cell functions.

### External IDs:
- HGNC ID: 21745.
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 53859.
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000175203.
- OMIM ID: 608270.
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q7Z5Y6.
- Other aliases for BMPER gene include: CRIM1L, CV-2, Crossveinless-2, and MGC126567.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- c.364C>T (p.Arg122Ter) - rs4558610.
- c.648C>T (p.Ala216Val) - rs199947602.
- c.383G>A (p.Arg128Gln) - rs121917821.
- c.911A>G (p.Ser304Gly) - rs112693838.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.433G>A (p.Glu145Lys) - rs1428218027.
- c.556C>T (p.Arg186Ter) - rs1550071333.
- c.799C>T (p.Pro267Ser) - rs1412193292.

### Related Diseases:
- Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
- Metastatic Osteosarcoma.
- Ovarian Cancer.
- Diaphragmatic Hernia (DH).

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific disease associated with BMPER mutations.
- However, some studies suggest that targeting BMPER could be a potential therapeutic strategy for PAH, since BMPER plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

### Drug Response:
- There is no information available regarding drug response related to mutations in BMPER gene.
