## Information about Gene TCF3

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function:

Gene TCF3 is located on chromosome 19q13.1 and it encodes a transcription factor named Transcription Factor 3 (TCF3). This gene is known to be involved in various biological processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is also a key regulator of B-cell development in the immune system.

### Function for Gene:

TCF3 functions as a transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating gene expression. It plays a vital role in the development and maturation of B-cells in the bone marrow, by regulating the production of immunoglobulin. In addition, TCF3 is also involved in the development and maintenance of other cells such as neuronal cells, muscle cells, and hematopoietic stem cells.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:

There are several missense mutations reported in the TCF3 gene. Some of these are listed below with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

| AA Change | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R40C | Missense mutation | rs397514386 |
| I104T | Missense mutation | rs1057519922 |
| R256W | Missense mutation | rs1057519922 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

Several somatic SNVs and InDels have been observed in the TCF3 gene in different types of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some of these are listed in the table below with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

| SNV/InDel | Cancer Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.845C>T | ALL | rs1555224685 |
| c.1144A>G | ALL | rs76792747 |
| c.1255G>A | ALL | rs1553738671 |

### Related Disease:

Mutations in the TCF3 gene have been associated with various types of cancers such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Mutations in this gene have also been linked to several non-cancerous conditions such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

### Treatment and Prognosis:

The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with mutations in the TCF3 gene vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. In general, treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis depends on several factors such as the age of the patient, the stage of the disease, and the response to therapy.

### Drug Response:

Currently, there are no drugs available that specifically target TCF3. However, several drugs that target other molecules in the same pathway as TCF3, such as BTK inhibitors, are being investigated for their potential use in the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
