# Gene DDHD1

**Function:** The DDHD1 gene encodes a phospholipase which is involved in the metabolism of phospholipids.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**
- HGNC: 25891
- NCBI Entrez: 23129
- Ensembl: ENSG00000156970
- OMIM: 607608
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86V88

**Aliases:** C7orf23, C14orf3, CGI-62, KIAA0570, ZFYVE19.

**AA Mutation List:** The dbSNP database lists several missense mutations in the DDHD1 gene. These include:
- p.Pro495Ser (rs371952027)
- p.Arg37Cys (rs774435579)
- p.Arg669Trp (rs772970907)
- p.Thr458Met (rs766118125)

**Mutation Type:** Missense.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** The COSMIC database reports several somatic mutations in the DDHD1 gene. These include missense, synonymous, and frameshift mutations.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the DDHD1 gene have been associated with several diseases such as Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, Autosomal Recessive 28 (SPG28), and CMT2Q (Charcot Marie Tooth Disease).

**Treatment and Prognosis:** As of now, there is no specific treatment available for mutations in the DDHD1 gene. The prognosis of patients with these mutations varies depending on the extent of the disorder.

**Drug Response:** No information available.
