# DHDDS Gene Information

## Gene

DHDDS is a symbol for the 'dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase' gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.13). 

#### Aliases

* Decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 1
* Farnesyl-diphosphate synthase domain-containing protein 1
* Trans-prenyltransferase DHDDS

#### Function

The DHDDS gene encodes a trans-prenyltransferase enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the mevalonate pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of isoprenoid lipid carriers that are essential for protein glycosylation, cell signaling, and immune system function.

## External IDs

Some of the external IDs for the DHDDS gene and its genomic location are as follows:

* HGNC: 27182
* NCBI Entrez: 79947
* Ensembl: ENSG00000143036
* OMIM: 608716
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q53G23

## Mutations

DHDDS gene mutations have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of genetic disorders that affect the retina. Some of the mutations in DHDDS include:

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with DHDDS gene.

## Related Diseases

Some of the diseases related to DHDDS gene mutations include:

* Retinitis pigmentosa
* Cone-rod dystrophy

## Treatment and Prognosis

There are no specific treatments available for DHDDS gene mutations. However, there are some general treatments for retinitis pigmentosa such as vitamin A supplementation, gene therapy, and retinal implantation. The prognosis for individuals with DHDDS gene mutations varies depending on the extent of the mutations and the severity of the associated retinal degeneration.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug response associated with DHDDS gene mutations.
