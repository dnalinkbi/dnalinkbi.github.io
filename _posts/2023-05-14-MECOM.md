## Information about gene MECOM

### Genetic Position
The MECOM gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q26.2.

### Pathology
Alterations in the MECOM gene are associated with several types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

### Function
The MECOM gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle progression.

- c.1051G>C (rs1064796248)
- c.808C>A (rs1057519207)

### Related Disease
- Acute myeloid leukemia 
- Myelodysplastic syndrome 
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 

### Treatment and Prognosis
MECOM gene status is often used as a prognostic marker in leukemia. The treatment varies according to the type and stage of the cancer.

### Drug Response
Several drugs are used for the treatment of leukemia, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplantation.
