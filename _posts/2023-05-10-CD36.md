# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene CD36

## Basic Information
- **Gene:** CD36
- **Aliases:** FAT, GP3B, GP4, PAS IV, SCARB3
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 7: 76.28 - 76.31 Mb
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 1678
    - NCBI Entrez: 948

## Function
The CD36 gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that is primarily expressed on the surface of various cell types, including platelets, monocytes, and adipocytes. CD36 protein is involved in several processes, including lipid metabolism, angiogenesis, and inflammation. CD36 acts as a receptor for a variety of ligands, including thrombospondin-1, oxidized lipids, long-chain fatty acids, and advanced glycation end products.
