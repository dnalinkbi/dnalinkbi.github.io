## Gene Information

### Gene Name
TLR6 (Toll Like Receptor 6)

### Function 
TLR6 encodes a protein that is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. TLRs play a crucial role in innate immunity by recognizing and responding to microbial pathogens. TLR6 is involved in the recognition of bacterial lipoproteins and activation of immune response pathways. 

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: 11846
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 10333
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000118402
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 4q31.3

### Aliases
- CD286
- TLR7
- TIL 

## Genetic Variations and Diseases

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- rs5743810: Arg249Ser, missense mutation 
- rs5743812: Pro249Pro, synonymous mutation 

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic variations have been reported in TLR6.

### Related Diseases
Abnormal TLR6 function or mutations in TLR6 have been associated with various diseases, including:
- Increased susceptibility to tuberculosis 
- Increased susceptibility to Gram-positive bacterial infections 
- Atopic dermatitis
- Asthma

### Treatment and Prognosis
At present, there are no specific treatments available for TLR6-related diseases. Treatment options include antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, and vaccination strategies. Prognosis varies widely depending on the disease and its severity.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response of TLR6-related diseases.
