## Information about gene HLA-B

### Genetic position
HLA-B is a gene located on chromosome 6p21.3-p21.1.

### Pathology
Variations of HLA-B are associated with susceptibility or resistance to several autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancies.

### Function for gene
HLA-B is an essential component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which present antigenic peptides to CD8+ T cells, mediating the cytotoxic immune response.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported mutations in the HLA-B gene. Here are some examples: 

| AA mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID | 
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Lys-67-Asn | Missense | rs1142345 |
| Asn-97-Lys | Missense | rs4388265 |
| Asn-115-Ser | Missense | rs41545545 |
| Ser-116-Thr | Missense | rs28929474 |
| Gly-259-Asp | Missense | rs54373200 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are some reported somatic mutations in the HLA-B gene, but they are rare. Here is an example:

| Mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| c.31C>T | Missense | not available |

### Related disease
Variations of HLA-B are associated with susceptibility or resistance to several autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancies such as:
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- Psoriatic arthritis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- HIV/AIDS
- Hepatitis B and C
- Malaria
- Cancer

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no specific treatment for HLA-B variations. Treatment and prognosis depend on the associated disease or condition.

### Drug response
HLA-B variations can impact drug response, including hypersensitivity reactions to some medications, such as abacavir in HIV-infected individuals.
