## Gene: KRT6B

### Genetics Position:
KRT6B gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 at the position 12q13.13.

### Pathology:
KRT6B gene is associated with various skin disorders such as pachyonychia congenita, palmoplantar keratoderma, and epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Mutations in KRT6B gene have been reported to cause these disorders.

### Function:
KRT6B gene encodes a member of the keratin family, which is an intermediate filament protein. This protein is predominantly expressed in the basal cells of stratified epithelia and plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the skin.

- c.388A>G (p.Lys130Arg) - rs768364320
- c.422A>G (p.Thr141Ala) - rs786205425

### Related Disease:
KRT6B mutations have been associated with the following skin diseases:
- Pachyonychia Congenita
- Palmoplantar Keratoderma
- Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no cure for pachyonychia congenita, palmoplantar keratoderma, or epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, including managing pain, skin care, and preventing infections. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

### Drug Response:
There is no specific drug available for the treatment of pachyonychia congenita, palmoplantar keratoderma, or epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Treatment is mainly supportive.
