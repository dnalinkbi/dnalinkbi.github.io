# Gene: ADD1

## Genetic Position
The gene ADD1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in the ADD1 gene have been associated with essential hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infarction.

## Function of Gene
The ADD1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of adducin, a cytoskeletal protein that regulates the assembly of spectrin-actin network in erythrocytes and non-erythroid cells. Adducin plays a role in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, including the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no reported somatic mutation in the ADD1 gene so far in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
- Hypertension, essential (OMIM: 145500)
- Atrial fibrillation, familial, 7 (OMIM: 612240)
- Myocardial infarction, susceptibility to (OMIM: 608446)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for essential hypertension, but it can be managed with lifestyle modifications and medications. Treatment options for atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction vary depending on the severity and underlying cause of the disease.

## Drug Response
Polymorphisms in the ADD1 gene have been shown to affect the response to antihypertensive therapy, including diuretics and beta-blockers.
