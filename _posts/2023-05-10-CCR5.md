# CCR5 Gene

The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 3 at the band q21.31. It spans around 22 kilobases of genomic DNA and consists of three exons. 

## Function for gene

The CCR5 gene encodes the CCR5 protein, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in immune and inflammatory responses by binding to chemokines. Specifically, it is involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

The most well-known mutation in the CCR5 gene is a 32-base pair deletion in its coding region, often referred to as CCR5Delta32. This deletion causes the premature termination of the CCR5 protein, resulting in truncated or non-functional protein expression. This defect hinders the binding of the virus to the CCR5 protein, which is the co-receptor that assists in the entry of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) into target cells. The dbSNP ID for this mutation is rs333.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic variations or SNVs/InDels found in the CCR5 gene. For instance, the rs1053873 variation leads to the substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 251 in the CCR5 protein. This variant allele is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection and various related viral diseases.

## Related disease

Various studies have established a close association between the CCR5 gene and its protein expression with different conditions, including autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and even cancer. Mutations in the CCR5 gene, such as CCR5Delta32, are crucial in determining HIV-1 susceptibility and acquisition.

## Treatment and prognosis

CCR5 gene and its protein expression have shown potential targets for various treatments, including HIV-1 and cancer therapy. Specifically, individuals with a homozygous CCR5Delta32 mutation exhibit resistance to the HIV-1 virus as an outcome of the lack of CCR5 protein expression.

## Drug response

Various drugs targeting CCR5 protein expression have been developed and researched, primarily in HIV-1 therapy. For instance, Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist that interferes with its function of binding with the HIV-1 virus. Other candidates are in development and clinical trials as potential curative treatments for HIV-1.
