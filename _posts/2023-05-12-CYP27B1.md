## Gene Information: CYP27B1

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: 12q13.1

### Pathology:
- CYP27B1 is associated with Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 (VDDR1)

### Function:
- CYP27B1 encodes an enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), which is the biologically active form of Vitamin D

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 2633
- NCBI Entrez: 1594
- Ensembl: ENSG00000174059
- OMIM: 609506
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15528

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- No AA mutations found in dbSNP

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- No somatic SNVs/InDels found in dbSNP

### Related Disease:
- Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 (VDDR1)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment options include supplementation with active Vitamin D, calcitriol and high doses of calcium and phosphate
- Prognosis is usually good with appropriate treatment

### Drug Response:
- Calcitriol is the most effective form of Vitamin D and is used as a therapeutic agent in patients with VDDR1
