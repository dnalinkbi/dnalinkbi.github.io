# Gene CD79A
### Basic Information
CD79A is the symbol of the gene encoding a protein that plays a critical role in the development and activation of B lymphocytes. It is located on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.2).
- External IDs: HGNC:1400, NCBI Entrez: 973, Ensembl: ENSG00000008311, OMIM: 112205, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11912.
- Aliases: B29, IGB, MB-1.

### Function
CD79A gene is involved in encoding for a protein called B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein beta chain (CD79a). This protein forms a heterodimeric complex with CD79b called B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and is critical for BCR-mediated signal transduction, leading to cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation. CD79A is expressed exclusively on the surface of B cells, making it an important biomarker for B-cell malignancies such as B-cell lymphomas.

### AA Mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several germline and somatic mutations reported in the CD79A gene. Here are some examples of missense mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

|AA mutation|Mutation Type |dbSNP ID |
|:---|:---|:---|
|L8R|Germline|rs121918071|
|C11R|Germline|rs3135388|
|T48N|Germline|rs149890727|
|D102N|Germline|rs765296601|
|D102G|Germline|rs753413284|
|L155P|Somatic|rs74315420|
|V205F|Somatic|rs786201631|
|C211S|Somatic|rs148784981|
|C211Y|Somatic|rs767569370|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in the CD79A gene have been identified in various types of B-cell neoplasms, such as Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma. Here are some examples of somatic mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

|Mutation Type |AA mutation|dbSNP ID |Disease|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Somatic|L145R|rs74315419|DLBCL|
|Somatic|C211S|rs148784981|DLBCL|
|Somatic|C211Y|rs767569370|Follicular lymphoma|
|Somatic|T232P|rs371125772|Burkitt lymphoma|

### Related disease
Dysfunction of the CD79A gene has been associated with numerous B cell-related diseases, especially B-cell lymphomas. Specifically, somatic mutations in the CD79A gene have been found in about 10% of DLBCL cases and 20-30% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) cases.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no specific treatment regimen available for CD79A gene-related diseases. However, B-cell lymphoma patients with CD79A mutations generally respond well to immunochemotherapy regimens such as R-CHOP and DA-R-EPOCH. Studies also suggest that CD79A mutation may confer a favorable prognosis in DLBCL patients.

### Drug response
There is currently no targeted therapy approved for CD79A mutations. However, some ongoing clinical trials are exploring the efficacy of targeting BCR-related signaling pathways in B-cell malignancies.
