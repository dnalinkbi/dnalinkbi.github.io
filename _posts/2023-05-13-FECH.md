# Gene FECH: Ferrochelatase

## Genetic Position
FECH gene is located on chromosome 18q21.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FECH gene can cause erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), an inherited disorder that affects heme synthesis. People with EPP experience skin sensitivity and pain when exposed to sunlight due to accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in the skin.

## Function
FECH gene encodes ferrochelatase, which is a key enzyme in heme biosynthesis pathway. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme, which is a critical component of hemoglobin.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels 
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for FECH gene.

## Related Disease 
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for EPP. Treatment is focused on avoiding exposure to sunlight and managing symptoms such as pain and itching when exposed to sunlight. It is important for patients to use protective clothing and sunscreen.

## Drug response
Afamelanotide has been approved by FDA for EPP. It increases skin pigmentation and reduces skin sensitivities to sunlight in EPP patients.
