# Gene AFDN

## Genetic Position

AFDN gene locates on Chromosome 16 ranging from base pair 5,835,478 to 5,957,901 (GRCh38/hg38).

## Pathology and Function

The AFDN gene encodes afadin, which is an intracellular scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in tight junction formation and maintenance. Afadin also regulates cell migration, proliferation, and signaling pathways. Pathogenic variants in this gene are associated with hereditary sensorineural hearing loss and autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability.

## Gene Information

- **Function:** intracellular scaffold protein

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels associated with AFDN gene.

## Related Disease

- hereditary sensorineural hearing loss
- autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for hereditary sensorineural hearing loss and autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability. Management strategies involve hearing aids, cochlear implants, communication therapies, and educational support.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug targeting AFDN gene for the treatment of related diseases.
