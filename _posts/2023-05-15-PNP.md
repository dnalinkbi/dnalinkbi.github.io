# Gene PNP

## Genetic position
Gene PNP is located at position 14q13.1 on the long arm of chromosome 14.

## Pathology
Mutations in gene PNP can cause an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

## Function for gene
The PNP enzyme is involved in purine metabolism, specifically the breakdown of inosine and guanosine to their respective bases.

## Related disease
Mutations in PNP are associated with an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

## Treatment and prognosis
The standard treatment for PNP deficiency-induced SCID is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the prognosis for this disease is poor, with a high mortality rate.

## Drug response
There is currently no specific drug therapy for PNP deficiency-induced SCID.
