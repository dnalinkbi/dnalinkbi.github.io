# Information about Gene EPHA2

## Gene Position
Gene EPHA2 is located on chromosome 1 in the genomic position 1p36.21.

## Gene Pathology
The EPHA2 gene plays a crucial role in cellular signal transduction and is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell migration, angiogenesis, and development. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, which regulates various biological activities, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.

## Gene Function
The main function of EPHA2 is the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. This gene is involved in several signaling pathways such as those related to the Wnt, Notch, and FGF signaling pathways. Furthermore, EPHA2 is known to be essential in embryonic development, tissue repair, and wound healing.
