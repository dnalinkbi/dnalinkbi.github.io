## Gene Information

### SIRT1

- Function: SIRT1 encodes a protein that belongs to the sirtuin family of proteins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases that regulate cellular processes such as metabolism, aging, and stress resistance.
- External IDs: HGNC: 19219, Entrez Gene: 23411, Ensembl: ENSG00000104231, OMIM: 601040, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96EB6
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10: 70,010,801 - 70,131,416
- Aliases: SIR2L1, SIR2alpha
