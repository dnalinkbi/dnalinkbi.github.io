# Gene Information

## Gene: SLC17A5

### Function:
The SLC17A5 gene encodes a protein known as sialin, which acts as a transporter for sialic acid and related compounds. Mutations in this gene can lead to the development of sialic acid storage diseases, which are a group of inherited disorders characterized by the accumulation of sialic acid in various tissues.

### External IDs and Genomic Location:

- HGNC: 11006
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 10728
- Ensembl: ENSG00000132253
- OMIM: 604322
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NQD5

SLC17A5 is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q15.

### Aliases:

- AST
- SIASD
- SPG73
- SPG73A

### AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:

Multiple non-synonymous mutations have been reported in SLC17A5, some of which are listed below:

|AA Change | Mutation type | dbSNP ID|
|----------|---------------|---------|
| R39C | Missense | rs121908029 |
| R39G | Missense | rs373041888 |
| R39L | Missense | rs121908031 |
| P163L | Missense | rs121908030 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for SLC17A5 gene.

### Related Disease:

Mutations in SLC17A5 gene can lead to the development of different types of sialic storage diseases including:

- Salla disease (SD)
- Infantile Sialic Acid Storage Disease (ISSD)
- Intermediate Severe Sialic Acid Storage Disease (ISSD)

### Treatment and Prognosis:

There is no cure for sialic storage disorders and treatment is mainly symptomatic. In severe cases, bone marrow transplantation may be used. The prognosis is highly variable and depends on multiple factors including the type of disease, age at onset, and disease severity.

### Drug Response:

There is no known drug response associated with SLC17A5.
