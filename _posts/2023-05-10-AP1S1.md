## Gene: AP1S1

**Function:** The AP1S1 gene encodes a protein subunit of the adaptin protein complex that functions in protein trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes.

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 609
- NCBI Entrez: 8905
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138332
- OMIM: 603530
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96CW1

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2q36.1

**Aliases:** CLAPS1, H(beta)AP1, HAPE

**AA mutation list:**
- p.Arg102Cys (rs137853191)
- p.Thr84Met (rs118204221)

**Mutation type:** Missense

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
- c.536C>T (rs759188254)
- c.518A>G (rs759188248)

**Related disease:** 
- Defects in AP1S1 have been associated with MEDNIK syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, enteropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and craniofacial abnormalities.

**Treatment and prognosis:**
- There is currently no cure for MEDNIK syndrome, and treatment is mainly supportive and tailored to manage the symptoms of the disease.

**Drug response:**
- There is no known drug or targeted therapy for AP1S1-related disorders at this time.
