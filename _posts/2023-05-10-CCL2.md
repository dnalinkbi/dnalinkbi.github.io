# Gene: CCL2

## Gene Function
CCL2 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2) is a protein-coding gene that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. It acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes, memory T cells, and natural killer cells, and is critical for the recruitment of these cells during inflammation.
