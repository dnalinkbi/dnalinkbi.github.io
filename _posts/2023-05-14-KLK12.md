# Gene KLK12

**Function:** The KLK12 gene encodes for kallikrein-related peptidase 12, a member of the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases. KLK12 has been linked to various biological processes, including tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cancer progression.

**External IDs:**
- Gene ID: 11016
- Genomic location: Chromosome 19q13.41
- Aliases: KLK-L12, TLSP, KLK14

**External Sites:**
- HGNC: 6374
- NCBI Entrez: 11016
- Ensembl: ENSG00000105310
- OMIM: 602799
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9P0L0

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
There are several missense mutations reported in the KLK12 gene, listed below:
- c.311C>T (p.Arg104Cys) rs111187850
- c.347T>C (p.Ile116Thr) - 
- c.413G>A (p.Asp138Asn) rs45480595

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
Currently, there is no well-established somatic mutation reported in the KLK12 gene.

**Related Disease:**
Recent GWAS studies have established an association between KLK12 variants and cancer susceptibility, including breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
Currently, there are no specific targeted therapies available for KLK12-associated diseases. Further research is warranted to determine its clinical relevance and develop potential therapeutic targets.

**Drug Response:**
Currently, there is no available information regarding the response of KLK12 variants to specific drug treatment.
