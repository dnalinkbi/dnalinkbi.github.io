# Information about BRCA2 gene

## Genetic Position and Pathology

The BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13 at 13q12.3. Mutations in this gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

## Function

The BRCA2 gene is involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination. It codes for a protein that interacts with RAD51, a recombinase enzyme that plays a crucial role in DNA repair.

## External IDs and Location, Aliases

- HGNC: 1101
- NCBI Entrez: 675
- Ensembl: ENSG00000139618
- OMIM: 600185
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51587

## AA Mutation List and Types with dbSNP ID

BRCA2 gene mutations can be classified as: missense, nonsense, frameshift, inframe, and splice-site mutations. The following are examples of AA mutations with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs:

- p.Asn991Serfs*12 (frameshift mutation; rs80359310)
- p.Gly2502Val (missense mutation; rs28897727)
- p.Ala3268Thr (missense mutation; rs555607782)
- p.Thr3384Profs*20 (frameshift mutation; rs754045492)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

The following are examples of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) with their dbSNP IDs:

- c.6275_6276insC (rs369729444)
- c.7959G>A (rs80358904)
- c.9500C>T (rs80359174)
- c.7528T>A (rs80359139)

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the BRCA2 gene are associated with a higher risk of several types of cancer, including:

- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Pancreatic cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

Individuals with BRCA2 mutations may undergo increased surveillance and/or prophylactic surgeries to decrease their risk of developing cancer. Targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, may also be used to treat certain types of cancer associated with BRCA2 mutations.

## Drug Response

Individuals with BRCA2 mutations may have an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, which are drugs that specifically target DNA repair pathways.
