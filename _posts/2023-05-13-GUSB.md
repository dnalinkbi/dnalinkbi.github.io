# Gene information for GUSB

## Gene Position
* Chromosome: 7
* Location: 7q11.21
* Start position: 69,070,087 bp
* End position: 69,093,324 bp

## Gene Function
The GUSB gene encodes an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase, which helps in the breakdown and recycling of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the body.

## External IDs and Aliases
* Gene ID: 2990
* Aliases: MPS7, beta-D-glucuronidase

## External Sites
* HGNC: 4656
* NCBI Entrez: 2990
* Ensembl: ENSG00000120885
* OMIM: 611499

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for the GUSB gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the GUSB gene can lead to a rare genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), also known as Sly syndrome. This condition results in the buildup of GAGs in the body's tissues and organs, leading to various health problems, including skeletal abnormalities, hearing loss, developmental delays, and progressive neurodegeneration.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MPS VII, but treatment options such as enzyme replacement therapy and stem cell transplantation can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

## Drug Response
Enzyme replacement therapy with guselkumab has shown promising results in improving the clinical outcomes and biomarkers of MPS VII in clinical trials.
