# Information about Gene HCN1

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Gene Name**: HCN1 (Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1)
- **Chromosome Location**: 5p13
- **Function**: The HCN1 gene encodes for a subunit of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family. These channels play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal excitability and pacemaker activity. HCN1 channels are primarily expressed in the brain and are involved in the control of heart rate, neuronal rhythmogenesis, regulation of cortical excitability, and epilepsy. 
- **Aliases**: BCNG-1, HGNC:4832
- **External IDs**: [HGNC]([Click](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:4832),) [NCBI Entrez]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/348980),) [Ensembl]([Click](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000171540;r=5:37333474-37602155),) [OMIM]([Click](https://www.omim.org/entry/602780),) [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot]([Click](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9P1Z3))

## Genetic Variation
- **AA Mutation List**: There are several missense mutations reported in the HCN1 gene that result in amino acid changes. Some of the commonly reported mutations are:
    - *p.Pro674Leu* (rs121918559)
    - *p.Gly482Ser* (rs121918560)
    - *p.Leu273Val* (rs79704498)
- **Mutation Type**:
    - Missense mutations
    - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
- **dbSNP ID**: rs121918559, rs121918560, rs79704498
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**: No somatic mutations have been reported yet in the HCN1 gene.

## Related Diseases
- HCN1 mutations have been associated with several neurological disorders, including:
    - Epilepsy: Mutations in HCN1 channel subunit have been identified as a cause of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).
    - Autism: Rare variants of HCN1 has been identified as a predisposing factor for autism spectrum disorder.
    - Major depression disorder: A study has reported the contribution of HCN1 variants in the susceptibility of developing depression disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for genetic disorders associated with HCN1 mutations. However, symptomatic treatment methods like antiepileptic drugs, vagus nerve stimulation and ketogenic diet have been found to be effective in treating the symptoms of the disease.
- The prognosis of patients with HCN1 gene mutations depends on the type and severity of the disorder.

## Drug Response
- A study has reported that the antiepileptic drug retigabine activates HCN1 channels and enhances their activity, which in turn reduces seizures.
