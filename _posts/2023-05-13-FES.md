# Gene: FES

## Overview
FES (Feline sarcoma oncogene) is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 15q22.31. The protein encoded by this gene is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation.

## Function
The FES protein plays a role in intracellular signaling pathways through the regulation of phosphorylation cascades. It is involved in the modulation of cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation. It also plays a crucial role in immune cell function and development.
