# Gene: KPNA1

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 22q13.2  
- **Pathology:** KPNA1 gene mutations are associated with multiple diseases, including various malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and developmental disorders.
- **Function:** The KPNA1 gene encodes karyopherin alpha-1, which is a member of the importin family of proteins. It plays a vital role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and regulates the trafficking of protein and other molecules across the nuclear envelope.
- **Aliases:** IPOA5, SRP1alpha

## External IDs
- **HGNC ID:** 6355
- **NCBI Entrez:** 3836
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000100152
- **OMIM ID:** 602738
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q importin subunit alpha-1

## Related Diseases
- Autoimmune diseases: Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Developmental disorders: Autosomal dominant intellectual disability
- Malignancies: Leukemia, Prostate cancer, Breast cancer, Lung cancer, etc. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment is dependent on the associated disease.
- There is no conclusive prognosis for KPNA1 mutations as it varies with the associated disease and mutation type.

## Drug Response
- There are no known drugs that target KPNA1 directly.
- However, several chemotherapeutic agents target the nuclear transport system, making KPNA1 a potential target for drug development.
