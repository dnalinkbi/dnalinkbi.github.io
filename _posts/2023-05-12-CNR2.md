## Information about Gene CNR2

- **Genetic Position:** The CNR2 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.11.

- **Pathology:**The CNR2 gene is associated with various pathological conditions, including inflammation, chronic pain, and cancer.

- **Function for Gene:** The CNR2 gene encodes the cannabinoid receptor 2, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by cannabinoids. The cannabinoid receptor 2 is widely expressed in the immune system and is involved in immune response modulation.

- **External IDs:**

    - Ensembl: ENSG00000164578
    - OMIM: 605051
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P34972

- **Aliases:** CB2, CNR2A, CX5

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

    - p.Asp8Asn (rs237872)
    - p.Pro96Ser (rs35761398)
    - p.Trp258Arg (rs149696631)
    - p.Glu319Gly (rs72827718)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

    - rs7574866
    - rs1801292
    - rs2229579
    
- **Related Disease:** 

    - Chronic pain
    - Cancer
    - Inflammation
    - Autoimmune diseases
    
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The drugs targeting the CNR2 gene could be a potential treatment for chronic pain and inflammation-related diseases. 

- **Drug Response:** Drug response varies among individuals and different drugs target different mutations, therefore individual response to treatment may vary.
