# Information about Gene MSX2

## Genetic Position
MSX2 gene is located on chromosome 5q34-q35.

## Pathology
Mutations in the MSX2 gene are associated with several cranial abnormalities, such as craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the skull bones), a condition which can cause an abnormally shaped skull.

## Function 
MSX2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in multiple developmental processes. This protein plays a crucial role in the development of bones, specifically in the formation of the craniofacial bones and skull.

- No known SNVs/InDels reported.

## Related disease
Mutations in the MSX2 gene are associated with Boston-type craniosynostosis, Craniosynostosis, metopic, and craniofacial dysostosis.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment of craniosynostosis depends on the severity of the condition. In some cases, surgery is required to relieve the pressure on the brain and correct the skull abnormalities. The prognosis for individuals with MSX2-related craniosynostosis depends on the extent of the fusion and the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug response
There is no known drug response related to the MSX2 gene.
