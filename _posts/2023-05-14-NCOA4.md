# Gene Information for NCOA4

## Genetic Position
NCOA4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q21.2). The gene spans around 98,203 bases of DNA on the forward strand.

## Pathology and Function
Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) plays an essential role in the regulation of autophagy. It acts as a selective autophagy receptor that targets ferritin for degradation. The degradation of ferritin releases iron, which is used for various metabolic processes in the cell. Mutations in the NCOA4 gene have been linked to various diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and iron metabolism disorders.
