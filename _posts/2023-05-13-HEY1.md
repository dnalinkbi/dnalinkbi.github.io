# Gene Information: HEY1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 8
- Location: 8q21.2

## Pathology
HEY1 is associated with several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and developmental disorders.

## Function
HEY1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family. It plays a critical role in several developmental processes, including heart development, neurogenesis, and hematopoiesis.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 15164
- NCBI Entrez: 23462
- Ensembl: ENSG00000164395
- OMIM: 602768
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5J3
- Aliases: BHLHB32, CHF2, HESR1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid mutations have been reported for HEY1.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- rs1581766
- rs121908345
- rs782047424

## Related Disease
HEY1 is associated with several diseases, including:
- Cardiovascular diseases (e.g., congenital heart diseases)
- Cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer, breast cancer)
- Developmental disorders (e.g., Alagille syndrome, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease associated with HEY1.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeting HEY1. However, some drugs targeting related molecules (e.g., Notch signaling pathway inhibitors) may indirectly affect HEY1 function.
