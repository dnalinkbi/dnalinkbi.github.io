# Gene C2 

### Genetic Position
Gene C2 is located on chromosome 6 in the q21.33-q22.1 region. It spans 26,930 base pairs. 

### Pathology 
Mutations in gene C2 lead to a deficiency in the complement system, specifically the C2 protein. This deficiency is associated with an increased risk for autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other immune complex-mediated diseases. 

### Function 
Gene C2 encodes the complement component C2 protein, which is part of the classical complement pathway. C2 is activated by C1 and then cleaves complement component C4 to form C4b2a, which leads to the formation of C3 convertase and eventual opsonization and lysis of pathogens.

### Related Disease
C2 deficiency is associated with an increased risk for autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other immune complex-mediated diseases. 

### Treatment and Prognosis 
There is currently no cure for C2 deficiency, but treatment options include replacing the deficient protein with human plasma-derived C2 concentrate or recombinant C2 protein. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the deficiency and associated autoimmune disorders. 

### Drug Response 
There is no known drug response specifically for C2 deficiency.
