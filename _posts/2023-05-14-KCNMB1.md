# KCNMB1 Gene

## Pathology and Function

KCNMB1 encodes for the β1 subunit of the potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, which plays a role in calcium signaling pathways and neuronal excitability. Mutations in KCNMB1 are associated with genetic susceptibility to epilepsy, and have also been linked to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels for KCNMB1.

## Related Diseases

- Epilepsy
- Bipolar Disorder
- Schizophrenia

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no known cure for genetic susceptibility to epilepsy. Treatment typically involves anti-seizure medications and management of any associated symptoms. The prognosis may vary depending on severity of symptoms and response to treatment.

## Drug Response

There is currently no known drug specifically targeting KCNMB1 mutations. However, anti-seizure medications may be used to control seizures associated with genetic susceptibility to epilepsy.
