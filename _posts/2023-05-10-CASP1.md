# Gene: CASP1

## Genetic Position:
CASP1 is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q22.3.

## Pathology:
CASP1 has been associated with various diseases including inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

## Function:
CASP1 encodes a cysteine protease that is involved in the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² and IL-18. It also plays a key role in the innate immune response against pathogens.

## Related Disease:
CASP1 has been associated with various diseases such as:
- Familial Mediterranean fever
- Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Alzheimer's Disease
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is limited information available on the treatment and prognosis of conditions related to CASP1. However, studies have shown that targeting CASP1 may have therapeutic potential in certain diseases such as cancer.

## Drug Response:
Several drugs targeting CASP1 have been developed and tested in preclinical studies. These include VX-765, a selective inhibitor of CASP1, which has shown promising results in phase II clinical trials for treating epilepsy.
