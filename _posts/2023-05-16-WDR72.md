# Information about Gene WDR72

## Basic Information
- **Gene Symbol:** WDR72
- **Gene Name:** WD repeat domain 72
- **Genomic Position:** Chr15: 56,684,094-56,708,222
- **Aliases:** FLJ22667, DKFZp686J16204

## Function of Gene
The function of the WDR72 gene is currently not well understood. It is predicted to encode a protein that contains numerous WD40 repeats, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, RNA processing, and cytoskeleton assembly.

## External IDs
- **HGNC:** 28730
- **NCBI Entrez Gene:** 284625
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000184554
- **OMIM:** 615812
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q6UX03

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No clinically significant mutations have been reported for the WDR72 gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the WDR72 gene.

## Related Disease
- Mutations in the WDR72 gene have been associated with Galloway-Mowat Syndrome (GAMOS), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and nephrotic syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for Galloway-Mowat Syndrome. Treatment usually involves managing symptoms and providing supportive care.
- Prognosis for individuals with GAMOS varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
- No information is available regarding drug response specific to WDR72 mutations.
