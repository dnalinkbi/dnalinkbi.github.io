# Information about gene DDB2

## Gene Position
The DDB2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p12-p11.2). 

## Pathology
DDB2 is associated with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E (XPE), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to UV radiation and an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

## Function
DDB2 encodes a protein that is part of the DDB1-CUL4A-RBX1 complex, which plays a role in DNA repair by removing DNA lesions caused by UV radiation.

## Related Disease
Mutations in DDB2 have been linked to the development of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E. Patients with XPE have a significantly increased risk of developing skin cancer due to their sensitivity to UV radiation.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E. Treatment typically involves avoiding sunlight as much as possible and using protective measures, such as hats and sunscreen, when in the sun. The prognosis for individuals with XPE depends on the severity of their condition and their risk of developing skin cancer.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that certain cancer drugs, such as cisplatin and mitomycin C, are less effective in cells with DDB2 mutations.
