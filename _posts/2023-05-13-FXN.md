## Gene FXN

FXN is the symbol for the Frataxin gene. This gene is located on chromosome 9q21.11 and encodes for a protein called frataxin. The frataxin protein is essential for the normal development and function of mitochondria, the organelles responsible for energy production within cells. 

### Function
The frataxin protein plays an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are required for the function of many proteins involved in cellular respiration. The protein is predominantly expressed in the mitochondria of cells and is crucial for maintaining proper mitochondrial function. 

### External IDs and aliases
Some of the external IDs or databases that could be used to access FXN gene related information are:
- HGNC: 3971
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 2395
- Ensembl: ENSG00000165060
- OMIM: 606829 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16595

Aliases for the gene can usually be identified using the HGNC database. Some of the known aliases for FXN include: FRDA, MLRQ, and X25.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The FXN gene is associated with a genetic disorder called Friedreich's ataxia, which is caused by mutations in the gene. More than a hundred pathogenic variants have been identified in the FXN gene. The majority of these mutations are expansions of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 resulting in reduced levels of functional frataxin protein. A list of amino acid (AA) mutations with the pathogenic type and the respective dbSNP ID is not applicable for this gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels identified for the FXN gene.

### Related disease
Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in the FXN gene. Patients with this disorder present with progressive muscle weakness, coordination difficulties, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and loss of sensation in the extremities. 

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for Friedreich’s ataxia. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications, and may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and medications for heart abnormalities, diabetes, or other symptoms. Prognosis for individuals with this disorder varies, but generally includes progressive disability and early mortality.

### Drug response
Currently there are no drugs approved to treat Friedreich’s ataxia, however experimental treatments including gene therapy, pharmacological agents and mithochondrial agents are under investigation.
