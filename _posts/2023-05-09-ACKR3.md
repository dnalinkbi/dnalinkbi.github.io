# Gene: ACKR3

## Genetic Position

ACKR3, also known as the Atypical Chemokine Receptor 3, is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q37.3. It spans a length of 15,819 base pairs.

## Pathology

ACKR3 is associated with various diseases such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, and infections.

## Function

ACKR3 functions as a chemokine receptor and plays a crucial role in immune responses. It regulates the trafficking of immune cells by specifically binding chemokines, and modulates the inflammatory response.

## Related Disease

ACKR3 is associated with various diseases such as cancer (breast, prostate, liver), inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, asthma), and infections (HIV, Hepatitis C).

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment options for ACKR3-related diseases vary according to the specific disease. However, targeting ACKR3 may be a potential therapy for some diseases. The prognosis also varies depending on the disease.

## Drug Response

ACKR3 is a potential target for various drugs. For instance, a small molecule antagonist of ACKR3 called BL5923 was found to significantly attenuate the inflammatory response in mice.
