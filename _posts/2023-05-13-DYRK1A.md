# Gene: DYRK1A

## Information
DYRK1A (Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) is a gene located on chromosome 21q22.13 that encodes a protein kinase involved in multiple cellular processes, including neuronal development and function, cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis. It has been associated with various diseases, including developmental disorders, intellectual disability, and cancer.

## Function
The protein encoded by DYRK1A acts as a kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues of target proteins. It plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, especially in the regulation of dendritic spines and synapses, and in the generation and maintenance of neural stem cells. It is also involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for DYRK1A-related disorders. Treatments are generally supportive and focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
DYRK1A inhibitors have been studied for their potential therapeutic use in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Down syndrome. These include harmine, INDY, and AZ191.
