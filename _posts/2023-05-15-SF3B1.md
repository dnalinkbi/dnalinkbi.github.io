## Information about gene SF3B1

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 2: 20,231,083 - 20,498,178
- **Pathology:** SF3B1 is a spliceosomal subunit protein that is involved in the processing of pre-mRNA. Mutations in SF3B1 have been implicated in the development of various hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and other types of leukemia.
- **Function for gene:** The protein encoded by SF3B1 is a subunit of the spliceosome complex, which is involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA to produce mature mRNA. Specifically, SF3B1 is a component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which binds to the branch point sequence in the pre-mRNA and is necessary for the recognition of the 3' splice site.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location:** HGNC: 10654; NCBI Entrez: 23451; Ensembl: ENSG00000175198; OMIM: 605590; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15750
- **Aliases:** MDS-RS, MDS5q, SAP155, retinitis pigmentosa 11 (RP11)
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
  - K700E (rs387906411)
  - K666T (rs115541439)
  - K700R (rs193636786)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - c.2143A>G (rs786202104)
  - c.2144C>T (rs786205292)
  - c.2143A>C (rs558636657)
- **Related disease:** SF3B1 mutations have been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and other types of leukemia.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for SF3B1-mutated MDS typically involves supportive care, such as transfusions and antibiotics, as well as disease-modifying therapies, such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, lenalidomide, and hypomethylating agents. In CLL, SF3B1 mutations have been associated with a favorable prognosis and may predict response to treatment with the drug fludarabine.
- **Drug response:** SF3B1 mutations have been associated with sensitivity to the splicing inhibitor drug, spliceostatin A, in preclinical models.
