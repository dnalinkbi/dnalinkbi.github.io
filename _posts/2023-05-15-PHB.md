## Gene Information

Gene: **PHB**

### Genetic Position

Chromosome: 17

Location: 17q21.33

### Pathology

The PHB gene has been associated with different diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and mitochondrial myopathies.

### Function for Gene

The PHB gene codes for a protein called prohibitin. Prohibitin protein is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular aging, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis.
