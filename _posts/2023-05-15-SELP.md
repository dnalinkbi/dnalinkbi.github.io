# Gene Information for SELP

## Gene Function
SELP stands for selectin P, which is a protein-coding gene. It encodes P-selectin or CD62P, which is a cell adhesion molecule found in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells. P-selectin is important in mediating the attachment and rolling of leukocytes during inflammation and thrombosis.

## Related Disease
SELP mutations have been associated with a variety of diseases, including acute lung injury, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and stroke.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for SELP-associated diseases depends on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. There are currently no specific treatments targeting SELP mutations. Prognosis depends on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited information about drug response related to SELP mutations.
