## Gene: TAPBP
#### Genomic Location: 6p21.3
#### Pathology: Associated with various autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. 

### Function
TAP-binding protein (TAPBP) is involved in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing and presentation pathway. It functions as a chaperone for peptide binding to MHC class I molecules and facilitates the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum where they can be presented to CD8+ T cells.
