# Information about Gene HEPH

## Genetic Position
The gene HEPH (Hephaestin) is located on chromosome 14q32.13.

## Pathology and Function
The HEPH gene encodes for a protein called Hephaestin, which is involved in iron metabolism and transport. This protein acts as a ferroxidase enzyme that oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+ and plays a role in the absorption, storage, and distribution of iron in the body. Mutations in the HEPH gene have been associated with iron metabolism disorders such as hemochromatosis.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the HEPH gene have been associated with hemochromatosis type 2B, which is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects iron metabolism in the body.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for hemochromatosis type 2B may involve phlebotomy, which is a procedure where blood is removed from the body to reduce iron levels. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug responses related to mutations in the HEPH gene.
