## Gene: NDUFA12

### Genetic Position
NDUFA12 is located on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.3)


### Pathology
Mutations in NDUFA12 have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a genetic disorder that affects the function of the mitochondria, leading to a variety of symptoms including muscle weakness, lactic acidosis, and developmental delay.


### Function
NDUFA12 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in cellular respiration. It plays a role in electron transfer from NADH to the respiratory chain.
