# Gene Information for GRPR

## Gene and Genomic Location
- Gene: gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 22q13.1

## Pathology
GRPR is reported to be involved in various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, pruritus, and asthma. 

## Function
GRPR encodes for the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to gastrin-releasing peptide and mediates various physiological functions such as gastric acid secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and control of thermoregulation.

## Aliases 
- BRS3
- BN-1
- NMB-R
- BB4
