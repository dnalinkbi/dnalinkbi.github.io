## Gene Information for SRCAP

### Genetic Position
SRCAP gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q23.3)

### Pathology
Mutations in SRCAP gene are associated with Floating-Harbor syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial anomalies, delayed bone age, and intellectual disability.

### Function
SRCAP gene encodes the Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein (SRCAP) which is a chromatin remodeling enzyme. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression through the modification of chromatin structure.
