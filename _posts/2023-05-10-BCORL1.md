## Information about gene BCORL1

### Genetic Position
BCORL1 is a gene located on chromosome Xq26.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in BCORL1 have been associated with oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome and X-linked intellectual disability.

### Function
The BCORL1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which is important for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during development.

- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q5VWG9
- Aliases: KIAA1575, BCL6 corepressor-like protein 1

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several missense mutations have been reported in the BCORL1 gene. These include:
- p.Arg168Cys (rs786205081)
- p.Arg168His (rs752305698)
- p.Arg168Ser (rs786205080)
- p.Arg168Trp (rs786205082)

All of these mutations are associated with OFCD syndrome.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic mutations reported in BCORL1 gene in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
Mutations in BCORL1 are associated with oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome, which is a rare X-linked developmental disorder characterized by eye abnormalities, facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects, and dental anomalies.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for OFCD syndrome. Treatment is generally supportive and based on the individual's specific symptoms.

### Drug Response
No drug response information available for BCORL1 gene.
