## Gene PDP1

- ### Function for gene  
  Gene PDP1 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Phosphatase Catalytic Subunit 1) is responsible for catalyzing the dephosphorylation of the E1 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex. This activity allows the complex to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, which is then used in the citric acid cycle.

- ### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID  
  There are several amino acid mutations that have been identified in the PDP1 gene. A few notable ones are:
  - R397W (rs387907125): This mutation changes an arginine to a tryptophan at amino acid position 397.
  - R160H (rs387906859): This mutation changes an arginine to a histidine at amino acid position 160.
  - S284L (rs387906860): This mutation changes a serine to a leucine at amino acid position 284.

- ### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID  
  There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the PDP1 gene.

- ### Related disease  
  It has been suggested that mutations in the PDP1 gene may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Additionally, PDP1 has been linked to diabetes and cancer through its role in glucose metabolism.

- ### Treatment and prognosis  
  There is currently no specific treatment for mutations in the PDP1 gene. However, targeting the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has been suggested as a potential treatment strategy for diseases involving PDP1 dysfunction.

- ### Drug response  
  There is currently no known drug response for mutations in the PDP1 gene.
