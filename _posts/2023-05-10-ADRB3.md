# Information about Gene ADRB3

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

The ADRB3 gene is located on chromosome 8p12 and encodes for the beta-3 adrenergic receptor. This protein is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipose tissue and has also been linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 

## Function for gene

The ADRB3 gene encodes for a G protein-coupled receptor that is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue. It plays a role in regulating lipolysis by promoting the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. Additionally, activation of ADRB3 stimulates thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, which helps to dissipate excess energy and maintain energy balance.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the ADRB3 gene.

## Related disease

Variants in the ADRB3 gene have been associated with a variety of conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma.

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there are no approved treatments that target ADRB3 directly. However, drugs that target other components of the adrenergic signaling pathway, such as beta-blockers and beta-agonists, are commonly used to treat conditions such as hypertension and asthma. Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the specific condition and individual patient factors.

## Drug response

Variants in the ADRB3 gene have been shown to affect response to certain drugs, such as beta-agonists used to treat asthma. For example, the p.Trp64Arg variant has been associated with decreased response to beta-agonist drugs.
