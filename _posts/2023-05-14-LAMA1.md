# Gene LAMA1

**Genetic position**

LAMA1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 at position 12.3 [18q12.3].

**Pathology**

Mutations in the LAMA1 gene have been associated with different pathological conditions including, cerebellar ataxia, congenital muscular dystrophy, and malignant neoplasms. 

**Function**

LAMA1 gene encodes for the alpha-1 subunit of laminin, which is a glycoprotein present in the extracellular matrix. Laminin is involved in various biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling.

**Related Disease**

Mutations in LAMA1 gene have been associated with different diseases such as:

- Congenital muscular dystrophy 
- Cerebellar ataxia 
- Laminin alpha 1-related muscular dystrophy 
- Generalized muscular dystrophy 

**Treatment and Prognosis**

There are no specific treatments for diseases associated with LAMA1 mutations. Management is mainly supportive and symptom-based. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the age of onset.

**Drug response**

There is limited information about drug response in diseases associated with LAMA1 gene mutations.
