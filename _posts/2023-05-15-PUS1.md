## Gene Information
**Gene Name:** PUS1

**Function:** Pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) is an enzyme that is involved in post-transcriptional modification of RNA. It catalyzes the isomerization of specific uridines in RNA to pseudouridine, which is important for RNA stability and function.

**External IDs:**
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 12q24.33
- HGNC: 31133
- NCBI Entrez: 80334
- Ensembl: ENSG00000110911
- OMIM: 608109
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BPU6

**Aliases:** DKFZP434L2135, bA526O7.2, C12orf51, dJ857C13.1

**Related Diseases:** PUS1 deficiency has been associated with mitochondrial myopathy. Patients with PUS1 mutations have been reported to have a broad range of clinical manifestations, including early-onset hearing loss, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and lactic acidosis.

**AA Mutation List:**
- c.605C>T (p.Arg202Cys), rs113994151
- c.683G>A (p.Gly228Asp), rs113994150
- c.1045C>T (p.Arg349Cys), rs869320704

All three mutations are missense mutations that result in the substitution of one amino acid for another.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
No somatic mutations have been reported in PUS1.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
Currently, there is no cure for PUS1 deficiency. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms, such as physical therapy for muscle weakness and hearing aids for hearing loss. The prognosis for patients with PUS1 mutations is highly variable, as the severity of symptoms can vary widely.

**Drug Response:**
No specific drug treatments are currently available for PUS1 deficiency.
