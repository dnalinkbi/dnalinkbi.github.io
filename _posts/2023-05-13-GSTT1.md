##Gene: GSTT1

###Pathology
The GSTT1 gene is involved in the metabolism of various xenobiotics. GSTT1 is a key enzyme in the detoxification of reactive intermediates formed by drugs, alcohol, and environmental carcinogens. GSTT1 is known to play a pro-carcinogenic role and to increase the risk of prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and other cancer types.

###Function
The GSTT1 gene encodes the glutathione S-transferase theta 1 protein. This protein is involved in the detoxification process of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to electrophilic centers on a wide range of substrates, including toxic compounds formed from normal metabolic processes or exposure to environmental chemicals.

###AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the GSTT1 gene, including insertion, deletion, and non-synonymous mutations. Among them, the most common SNP in the GSTT1 gene is a null allele (GSTT1*0), which results from a deletion of the entire gene sequence. The dbSNP ID for the GSTT1*0 mutation is rs71748309.

###Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations identified in the GSTT1 gene, including SNVs and InDels. One of the notable somatic mutations is rs2074410, which is a non-synonymous SNP (missense) that results in the change of arginine to histidine at position 139. This somatic mutation has been associated with the risk of bladder cancer.

###Related Disease
The GSTT1 gene has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Null variants in the GSTT1 gene have been observed to be a risk factor for prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and lymphoma.

###Treatment and Prognosis
There are no specific treatments for GSTT1-related diseases. However, patients with null variants in the GSTT1 gene should take appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to environmental toxins, such as avoiding cigarette smoke, alcohol, and other environmental toxins.

###Drug Response
Several studies have investigated the relationship between GSTT1 polymorphisms and drug response. Polymorphisms in the GSTT1 gene have been associated with altered drug metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity.
