# Information on Gene RFX2

### Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

- Gene: RFX2 (regulatory factor X2)
- Location: Chromosome 19q13.3
- Pathology: There is limited information on the pathology associated with RFX2. However, some studies have found that RFX2 expression is downregulated in certain cancers such as glioma and breast cancer, and that it may function as a tumor suppressor gene.
- Function: The RFX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of genes related to the immune and inflammatory responses, as well as genes associated with ciliary function, intracellular protein transport and autophagy.

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000105212
- OMIM ID: 601690
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P48382
- Aliases: RFXB, RFXDC2

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is limited information on the somatic SNVs/InDels associated with RFX2. However, some studies have identified SNVs in the RFX2 gene in certain cancers such as glioblastoma and prostate cancer. Below are some examples of somatic SNVs with their dbSNP ID:

| SNV | dbSNP ID |
| --- | -------- |
| Gln82Arg | rs61747700 |
| Thr268Met | rs572969561 |
| Gln296His | rs113169021 |

### Related Disease

Some studies have suggested that RFX2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, including:

- Neurological disorders: RFX2 has been implicated in the development of cilia-related neurological disorders such as Joubert syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
- Cancer: RFX2 expression is downregulated in certain cancers such as glioblastoma and breast cancer, and may function as a tumor suppressor gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There are no specific treatments or prognostic information available for RFX2-related disorders.

### Drug Response

There is no known drug response associated with RFX2.
