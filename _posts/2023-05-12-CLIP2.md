# Gene: CLIP2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: 7q36.1

## Pathology
CLIP2 gene is associated with various diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and mental retardation.

## Function
The CLIP2 gene encodes for a protein that plays a role in microtubule dynamics and regulation of cytoskeleton organization. It interacts with other proteins and is involved in axon guidance, neuron migration and neurite outgrowth.
