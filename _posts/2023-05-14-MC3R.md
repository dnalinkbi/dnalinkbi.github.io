# Gene: MC3R

## Information

### Pathology
The MC3R (melanocortin 3 receptor) gene is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Mutations in this gene can lead to increased weight gain and higher body fat mass.

### Function
MC3R encodes for a G protein-coupled receptor that binds with melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and regulates energy homeostasis, including food intake and energy expenditure.

### Genomic Location and Aliases
- Gene ID: 4158
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 20: 30008040-30011643

### Related Disease
- Obesity

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for obesity caused by MC3R mutations. Treatment options include lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) and possible pharmacotherapy.

### Drug Response
Some studies have suggested that treatment with MC3R agonists may be effective in treating obesity caused by MC3R mutations.
