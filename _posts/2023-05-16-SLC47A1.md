## Gene Information: SLC47A1

### Genetic Position
SLC47A1 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at position 11.2-q12.

### Pathology
Mutations in SLC47A1 have been associated with drug resistance and toxicity. The gene plays a significant role in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination in the body. 

### Function
SLC47A1 encodes for a protein that acts as an organic cation transporter. The protein is primarily found in the liver and kidneys and helps to eliminate drugs and toxins from the body.

### Related Disease
SLC47A1 mutations and drug response have been associated with multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for drug resistance and toxicity caused by SLC47A1 mutations involves medication adjustment and monitoring of drug levels in the body. The prognosis for individuals with SLC47A1 mutations depends on the specific mutation, drug response, and associated medical conditions.

### Drug Response
SLC47A1 mutations have been associated with altered drug response, including resistance or toxicity to drugs such as metformin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin.
