# Information about gene CTSB

## Genetic Position
Gene: CTSB\
Chromosome: 8\
Start position: 25,819,764 bp\
End position: 25,896,127 bp

## Pathology and Function
Function: This gene encodes for Cathepsin B, a member of the papain-like family of cysteine proteases. This enzyme is involved in intracellular protein degradation and is implicated in several pathological conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and arthritis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The specific inhibitor of CTSB has been shown to have therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease. There is ongoing research to investigate CTSB inhibitor's therapeutic potential in other conditions such as cancer and arthritis.

## Drug response
The CTSB-specific inhibitor, CA-074, has been shown to have potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cancer.
