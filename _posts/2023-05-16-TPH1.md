## **Gene TPH1**

The TPH1 gene (tryptophan hydroxylase 1) is located on chromosome 11p15.3 and encodes the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of serotonin, namely the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan. 

### Function
The TPH1 gene plays a crucial role in serotonin synthesis in the periphery, mostly in enterochromaffin cells of the gut. Serotonin produced in these cells is stored in platelets and later released into the circulation, where it plays a vital role in mood regulation, gastrointestinal function, and cardiovascular homeostasis.

### Related Diseases
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TPH1 gene have been associated with various psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and gastrointestinal disorders. Some of the diseases associated with the TPH1 gene are:
- Major depressive disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Schizophrenia
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Parkinson's disease
- Irritable bowel syndrome

### Treatment and Prognosis
No specific targeted treatment is available for TPH1-related disorders. However, drugs that target the serotonergic system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are beneficial in treating psychiatric conditions associated with TPH1 gene mutations. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and the type of disorder.

### Drug response
The TPH1 gene mutations have been associated with altered drug metabolism of certain medications, such as SSRIs.
