# Gene G6PD Information

## Genetic Position
G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) gene is located on the X chromosome at Xq28.

## Pathology
G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the G6PD gene that leads to reduced levels or complete absence of the G6PD enzyme.

## Function
The G6PD enzyme plays an important role in protecting red blood cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. It provides NADPH, which the red blood cells need to maintain the protective antioxidant glutathione in a reduced state.

None reported.

## Related Disease
G6PD deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia, particularly after exposure to certain triggers such as infection, drugs, or fava beans.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for G6PD deficiency, but avoiding triggers and managing symptoms can help prevent hemolytic anemia.

## Drug Response
Individuals with G6PD deficiency may have adverse reactions to certain medications, including antimalarials, sulfonamides, and some antibiotics.
