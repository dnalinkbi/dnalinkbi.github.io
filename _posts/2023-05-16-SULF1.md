# Gene SULF1
**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 8q13.2

**Pathology:** SULF1 gene is associated with various diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and developmental disorders.

**Function:** SULF1 encodes for a sulfatase enzyme that modifies the extracellular matrix by cleaving 6-O sulfate groups on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, affecting signaling pathways mediated by growth factors and cytokines.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC ID: 20438
- NCBI Entrez ID:  sulfatase 1 (NM_001031739)
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000147437
- OMIM ID: 605370
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8IWU5

**AA Mutation List and dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg493Cys (rs192644771)
- p.Cys43Arg (rs200434731)
- p.Ile30Thr (rs371183747)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.1198G>A (rs193547251)
- c.157G>A (rs193267368)
- c.310A>T (rs150091842)

**Related Diseases:**
- Colorectal Cancer
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Glioblastoma
- Neuroblastoma
- Breast cancer

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
- Various studies have suggested that SULF1 plays a role in cancer progression and metastasis.
- Targeting SULF1 enzyme activity may provide a potential therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.
- The prognosis of diseases associated with SULF1 gene varies depending on the disease and individual case.

**Drug Response:**
- The response to drugs targeting SULF1 is still under investigation.
