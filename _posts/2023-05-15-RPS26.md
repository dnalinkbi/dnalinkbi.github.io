### Information on Gene RPS26

**Genetic Position**: RPS26 gene is located on chromosome Xq28 position 28.

**Pathology**: Mutations in RPS26 gene have been linked to the development of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), which is a rare blood disorder that usually presents in the first year of life and is characterized by a failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells leading to anemia.

**Function of Gene**: The RPS26 gene encodes the ribosomal protein S26, which is a component of the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for the translation of mRNA into protein.

**External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location**:

- HGNC ID: HGNC:10475
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 6235
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000147256
- OMIM ID: 180480
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P46783
- Aliases: DBA13, HLC10

The genomic location of RPS26 gene is at the coordinates X:153,457,253-153,463,271.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 

Some of the known AA mutations in RPS26 gene associated with DBA are:

|AA Change|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|Pro29Thr|Missense|rs267607090|
|Arg87Pro|Missense|rs758084840|
|Ile73Leu|Missense|rs781571866|
|Leu64Phe|Missense|rs142035041|
|Leu60Pro|Missense|rs139972964|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 

There is no information available about somatic SNVs/InDels in RPS26 gene.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in RPS26 gene is associated with the development of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA).

**Treatment and Prognosis**: The treatment of DBA is mainly supportive and includes blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and stem cell transplantation in some cases. The prognosis of DBA varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms and the response to treatment. In some cases, the condition can be life-threatening.

**Drug Response**: There is no specific drug for the treatment of DBA, and the response to treatment varies depending on the severity of the disease.
