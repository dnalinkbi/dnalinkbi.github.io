# Gene FLAD1

## Genomic Position
The gene FLAD1 is located on the chromosomal locus 1p36.22.

## Function
FLAD1 encodes for Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of flavin cofactors that can serve as electron carriers in various cellular redox reactions.

## Related Diseases
- Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MADD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MADD, but certain treatments such as riboflavin supplementation and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet can help manage the symptoms of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is limited research on the drug response of FLAD1 mutations.
