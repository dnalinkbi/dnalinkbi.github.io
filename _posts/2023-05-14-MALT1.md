# Gene MALT1

## Genetic Position

- MALT1 gene is located on chromosome 18q21.3.
- The gene spans about 22.9 kb and contains 19 exons.

## Pathology and Function

- The MALT1 gene encodes for a protein called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1).
- The protein is primarily expressed in immune cells such as B and T lymphocytes.
- MALT1 plays a crucial role in the activation of immune cells and the regulation of various signaling pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation.
- Mutations or dysregulation of MALT1 have been implicated in several diseases, including lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and autoimmune disorders.

## Related Diseases

- Mutations and dysregulation of the MALT1 gene have been linked to several diseases, including:
  - Lymphoma
  - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
  - Autoimmune disorders
  - Immunodeficiency syndromes

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for MALT1-associated diseases vary depending on the specific disease and the extent of the disease.
- Prognosis for MALT1-associated diseases also depends on the specific disease and the stage at which it is diagnosed.

## Drug Response

- The dysregulation of MALT1 has been targeted for the treatment of lymphoma and other diseases using various drugs such as MALT1 inhibitors.
- Some of the drugs targeting MALT1 include INCB-024360, CRA-024781, and MALT1 selective inhibitors.
