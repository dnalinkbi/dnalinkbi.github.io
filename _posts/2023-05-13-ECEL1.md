## Related Disease
- Disease: Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly (CCA) or Beals Syndrome
- Pathology: Caused by mutations in FBN2 and ECEL1 resulting in altered connective tissue, skeletal abnormalities, and joint contractures.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment: Physical therapy, orthopedic interventions, and pain management for joint contractures and dislocations.
- Prognosis: Variable, but typically a non-life-threatening condition with good prognosis in managing symptoms and function.

## Drug Response
- No specific drug response information available at this time.
