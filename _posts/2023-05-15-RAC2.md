# Gene Information: RAC2

## Genetic Position
*RAC2* gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the *RAC2* gene have been associated with susceptibility to several infectious and inflammatory diseases, including neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome, recurrent bacterial infections, and chronic granulomatous disease.

## Function
The *RAC2* gene encodes a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which play an important role in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cellular functions such as cell motility, phagocytosis, and the respiratory burst in neutrophils.
