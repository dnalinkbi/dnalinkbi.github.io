# Information about Gene GSC

## Gene Position and Pathology
- Chromosome: 12
- Gene location: 12q13.3
- Pathology: The GSC gene is associated with several diseases such as cancer, developmental disorders, birth defects, and reproductive issues.

## Gene Function
The GSC gene encodes a protein that is involved in early embryonic development. It plays a critical role in the formation of the central nervous system and the midline of the developing embryo.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 4617

## AA Mutation and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- There are 38 AA mutations listed for GSC on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
- Mutation types include Missense, Frameshift, and Stop gained.
- dbSNP IDs are available for several of the mutations including rs746912664, rs786205592, rs374123198, and rs587784833.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Several somatic SNVs and InDels have been reported in GSC on the COSMIC database.
- dbSNP IDs are available for some of the reported SNVs/InDels.

## Related Diseases
- Holoprosencephaly: GSC mutations have been associated with holoprosencephaly, a developmental disorder that affects the brain and face.
- Breast Cancer: GSC has been found to be overexpressed in breast cancer and may play a role in tumorigenesis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for GSC-related disorders, and treatment is generally supportive.
- Prognosis depends on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There are no drugs specifically targeting GSC, but some drugs targeting related pathways may be useful in GSC-related disorders.
