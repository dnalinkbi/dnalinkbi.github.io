# Information about gene PRCC

## Genetic position:

PRCC gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p21). It ranges from 14,815,593 to 14,985,880 base pairs on the minus strand of chromosome 1.

## Pathology:

PRCC gene encodes a protein called proline-rich protein PRCC, which is involved in the development of the kidney. PRCC gene mutations or abnormalities are associated with the development of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) - a malignant tumor of the kidney. 

## Function:

The proline-rich protein PRCC is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, and apoptosis. It plays a crucial role in the differentiation of renal tubular cells during kidney development and in maintaining the normal function of the kidney.

- Aliases: papillary renal cell carcinoma (translocation-associated), RCCP1, TPRC

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

- Missense mutation: V70A (rs371953768), T74A (rs745349240), T74M (rs137853456), P96S (rs104894501), G106R (rs104894502), H128D (rs2034603).
- Nonsense mutation: Q157* (rs387906859).
- Frameshift deletion: p.K45del (rs863224570), p.L91fs (rs879253806).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

- c.251T>G (rs763915115)
- c.107C>A (rs372067646)
- c.35G>C (rs540983863)

## Related disease:

Mutations or abnormalities in PRCC gene are closely related to the development of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) - a malignant tumor of the kidney.

## Treatment and Prognosis:

The prognosis of pRCC varies depending on the stage and grade of the tumor. Generally, pRCC is more responsive to immunotherapy and targeted therapy than traditional chemotherapy, and prognosis can be improved with the removal of the tumor through surgery.

## Drug response:

PRCC gene mutations are known to be associated with sensitivity or resistance to specific drugs, particularly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sunitinib and pazopanib. However, much is still unknown about the significance of PRCC mutations with regard to drug response.
