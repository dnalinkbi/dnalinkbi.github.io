# Information about Gene EPHB6

## Genetic Position
The EPHB6 gene is located on chromosome 7q33.3.

## Function
The EPHB6 gene encodes a member of the ephrin receptor subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases. It plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 3393
- NCBI Entrez: 2048 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000157606
- OMIM: 600100
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15197

Aliases:
- EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase 6
- Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor EPH-6

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations identified in the EPHB6 gene, including:
- S276N (rs3739316)
- R340H (rs35424281)
- R365C (rs200138771)
- R403H (rs74515453)

These mutations are missense mutations and have been associated with the development of certain cancers.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the EPHB6 gene that have been identified in various cancers. For example:
- c.932C>T (p.R311C) (rs200000600)
- c.1127C>T (p.P376L) (rs150312248)
- c.770C>T (p.R257W) (rs876657591)

## Related Disease
The EPHB6 gene has been implicated in several different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for cancer patients with EPHB6 mutations is not yet clear and more research is needed to determine the best course of action.

## Drug Response
No specific drugs have been developed that target EPHB6 mutations.
