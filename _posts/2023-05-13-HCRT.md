### Information about gene HCRT

**Genetic Position:** The HCRT (Hypocretin) gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2, from base pair 41,661,131 to 41,663,295.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the HCRT gene have been associated with a rare neurological disorder called narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), and abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

**Function:** The HCRT gene encodes two neuropeptides (orexin A and B) that play a crucial role in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and feeding behavior. Orexins bind to receptors in the brain that control the release of various neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, and acetylcholine, which are involved in arousal, attention, and reward pathways. The loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus leads to narcoleptic symptoms.

- Aliases: HCRTR1, OX1R, OX2R

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the HCRT gene, some of which are associated with narcolepsy susceptibility. The following are some of the SNPs with their corresponding amino acid (AA) changes and dbSNP IDs:
- rs2271933 (p.Ala402Thr)
- rs2653349 (p.Leu104Phe)
- rs3781637 (p.Ala408Val)
- rs3771943 (p.Thr408Met)
- rs1049337 (p.His424Tyr)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There is no evidence of somatic mutations in the HCRT gene in cancer or other diseases.

**Related Disease:** Narcolepsy is the main disease associated with mutations in the HCRT gene.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for narcolepsy, but there are treatments available to manage its symptoms, including stimulants, antidepressants, and sodium oxybate. These treatments can improve wakefulness and reduce cataplexy episodes. However, some patients may not respond well to medication, and the effects of treatment may vary depending on the severity and subtype of narcolepsy.

**Drug Response:** The HCRT system is a potential target for the development of new drugs for sleep disorders and other conditions. Several drugs that modulate orexin receptors are being tested in clinical trials, such as suvorexant, lemborexant, filorexant, and TAK-925.
