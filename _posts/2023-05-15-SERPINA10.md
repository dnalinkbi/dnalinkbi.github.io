# **Gene Information on SERPINA10** 

## Genetic Position 

SERPINA10 is located on chromosome 14q32.13. It spans roughly 21 kb and contains 5 protein-coding exons.

## Pathology and Function 

SERPINA10 codes for the protein called angiotensinogen (AGT), which is an important component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). AGT is known to be synthesized and secreted mainly by the liver and secreted also by adipose tissue. It is converted to its active form by the enzyme renin, which is produced in the kidneys. The active AGT molecule then undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions to ultimately produce the hormone angiotensin II which is a potent vasoconstrictor.
 
Variants in SERPINA10 have been associated with many physiological and pathological conditions such as hypertension, kidney failure, preeclampsia, and cardiovascular diseases.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are no somatic variants in SERPINA10 present in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases

Variants in SERPINA10 have been associated with many physiological and pathological conditions such as hypertension, kidney failure, preeclampsia, and cardiovascular diseases. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Targeting the RAAS system, and in particular, angiotensin II, has been a widely used and successful strategy for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Drugs targeting renin, ACE, and angiotensin recepffwtors have been developed and used clinically.

## Drug Response 

In hypertensive patients, several studies have shown that AGT gene variants are associated with different outcomes, including hypertension severity, age of onset, and treatment resistance. Additionally, AGT variants have been shown to impact the response to antihypertensive drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
