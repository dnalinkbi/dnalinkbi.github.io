## Gene: CELSR1

### Position
- Chromosome: 22
- Start Position: 43018018
- End Position: 43128105

### Pathology and Function 
- The CELSR1 gene encodes for the protein Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, which is involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP pathway plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including embryonic development, neural tube formation, and cell motility. 
- In humans, genetic variations in CELSR1 have been associated with several diseases, including cognitive dysfunction, neural tube defects, and cancer.
