# Information about gene FOXO3

## Genetic Position
The FOXO3 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 at position 21.1. It spans a length of 76.84 kb.

## Pathology and Function
The FOXO3 gene encodes a member of the forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors. This protein is involved in various cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and oxidative stress response. Studies have shown that FOXO3 plays a significant role in ageing and longevity and is associated with several age-related diseases.

## Related Disease
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women. Studies have suggested that FOXO3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment targeting FOXO3 gene. However, lifestyle interventions such as exercise and calorie restriction have been shown to increase FOXO3 expression and promote longevity.

## Drug Response
Variations in FOXO3 have been associated with drug response. For example, a study has shown that the rs479744 polymorphism is associated with response to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin.
