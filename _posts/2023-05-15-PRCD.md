## Information about Gene PRCD

### Genetic Position
The gene PRCD is located on chromosome 17, specifically at position 17q21.2.


### Pathology
PRCD stands for progressive rod-cone degeneration, which is a form of retinal degeneration causing progressive vision loss in both dogs and humans. Mutations in this gene are known to cause the condition in dogs and can also be associated with retinitis pigmentosa in humans.


### Function
The PRCD gene encodes for a protein involved in the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. It plays a crucial role in the visual transduction process by regulating the activity of deactivation enzymes that halt the phototransduction cascade.

Note: These variants are not commonly found in populations and may be pathogenic. However, further investigation is needed.


### Related Disease
- Progressive rod-cone degeneration in dogs
- Retinitis pigmentosa in humans


### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for progressive rod-cone degeneration caused by PRCD mutations. Treatment options are limited and mainly focus on improving quality of life, such as providing supportive care and modifying living conditions to accommodate the individual's visual impairment. The prognosis heavily depends on the severity of the disease and how early it is diagnosed.


### Drug Response
Currently, there is no specific drug or treatment available that targets PRCD-related retinal degeneration directly.
