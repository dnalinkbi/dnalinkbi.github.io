## Gene: PRX 
- **Function:** This gene encodes for periaxin protein which is specific to the myelin sheath in the nervous system. It is involved in the formation of the paranodal junction, which plays an important role in nerve conduction. 
- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC: 9368
    - NCBI Entrez: 5801
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000124664
    - OMIM: 606346
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16588
    - Genomic Location: Chr19:11,466,778-11,533,680
- **Aliases:** Myelin Protein Zero-Like 2 (MPZL2), Schwann Cell-Myelin Protein (SCP)
- **AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:**
    - c.109G>A, p.Ala37Thr, rs121908700
    - c.191C>A, p.Thr64Asn, rs113169202
    - c.215A>G, p.Lys72Arg, rs149913968
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.797G>A, p.Arg266His, rs113322996
    - c.776C>T, p.Arg259Cys, rs201066197
    - c.467G>A, p.Val156Met, rs76722246
- **Related Disease:** This gene is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F (CMT4F), a hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy that affects the peripheral nerves leading to muscle weakness and sensory loss.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for CMT4F, but symptomatic treatments such as physical therapy and orthopedic devices can improve the quality of life of affected individuals. The prognosis for CMT4F varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.
- **Drug Response:** There is currently no specific drug for the treatment of CMT4F, but some drugs such as vitamin C and erythropoietin have been found to have a positive effect on the symptoms of the disease in some individuals.
