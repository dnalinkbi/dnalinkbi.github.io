## Gene: MTHFD1  

### Genetic Position  
The MTHFD1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at position 14q24.3.  

### Pathology  
MTHFD1 gene is involved in various biological pathways, including one-carbon metabolism, methylation, and purine synthesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases, including neural tube defects, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.  
 
### Function  
MTHFD1 encodes a trifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in one-carbon metabolism. It is responsible for the interconversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. Additionally, the enzyme has a regulatory function in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway.

### Related Disease  
MTHFD1 variants are associated with neural tube defects, homocysteine levels, schizophrenia, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for MTHFD1-related disorders, but supplementation with folic acid may help to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Prognosis depends on the specific disease association. 

### Drug Response  
No clear evidence indicating differential drug response according to MTHFD1 status has been reported.
