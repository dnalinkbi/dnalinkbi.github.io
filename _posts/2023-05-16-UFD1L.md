# Gene Information: UFD1L

**Genetic Position:** 22q11.23

**Pathology:** UFD1L gene is associated with several diseases such as Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and some cancers.

**Function:** The UFD1L gene encodes a protein that functions as a cofactor for p97, a member of the ATPase family of proteins. The p97/UFD1L complex is involved in several cellular processes such as protein degradation, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, and DNA damage repair.

- HGNC: 12568
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 7354
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100211
- OMIM: 191342
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O94876

**Aliases:** UFD1, UFD1H, UFD1-H, Ubiquitin recognition factor in ER-associated degradation 1 homolog

**AA Mutation List (dbSNP ID)**
- p.Glu200Lys (rs137853249)
- p.Pro391Leu (rs137853250)
- p.Asn474His (rs760341282)
- p.Pro525Leu (rs762780785)

**Mutation Type:** Missense

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported

**Related Disease:** Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and some cancers.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis depend on the type and severity of the associated disease.

**Drug Response:** The UFD1L gene has not been linked to any known drug response.
