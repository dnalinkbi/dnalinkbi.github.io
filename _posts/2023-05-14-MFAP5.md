# Information about gene MFAP5

## Genetic Position
The gene MFAP5, also known as MAGP2 (microfibrillar-associated glycoprotein 2), is located on chromosome 12q21.33.

## Pathology
Mutations in the MFAP5 gene have been associated with microfibrillar-associated proteinosis, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder involving the accumulation of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix.

## Function
The MFAP5 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the assembly and maintenance of elastic fibers and microfibrils in connective tissue. It may also play a role in cell migration and adhesion.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 6945
- Entrez Gene: 79167
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000150788
- OMIM ID: 608667
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9HCB6
- Aliases: Magp2, MP20, MFAP4L, dJ191F10.3

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known AA (amino acid) mutations in the MFAP5 gene, including:
- p.Ala39Val (rs61758222)
- p.Arg110Trp (rs61751097)
- p.Arg110Gln (rs181151342)
- p.Gly138Arg (rs61751096)
- p.Ile156Met (rs61754463)

These mutations are all missense mutations, which means that they result in a single amino acid change in the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several known somatic SNVs (single nucleotide variants) and InDels (insertions or deletions) in the MFAP5 gene, including:
- rs763621712
- rs751223475
- rs765944611
- rs759147140

## Related Disease
Mutations in the MFAP5 gene have been associated with microfibrillar-associated proteinosis, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder involving the accumulation of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for microfibrillar-associated proteinosis. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and addressing complications as they arise.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specifically for mutations in the MFAP5 gene.
