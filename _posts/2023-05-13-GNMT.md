# Information about Gene GNMT

**Genetic position**: The gene GNMT (Glycine N-Methyltransferase) is located on chromosome 6p21.3.

**Pathology**: Mutations in the GNMT gene have been associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

**Function**: GNMT is involved in the regulation of methyl group metabolism, specifically in the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in the liver.

**External IDs and Aliases**: GNMT is also known as GAMT, GNMT1, and MTAase. External IDs include:
- HGNC: 4408
- NCBI Entrez: 84707
- Ensembl: ENSG00000118777
- OMIM: 606628
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14749

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 

Currently, there is one missense mutation reported in the GNMT gene:
- p.Arg197Gln (rs138616701)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 

There are various somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the GNMT gene with their respective dbSNP IDs:
- rs115098093
- rs756708097
- rs267607228
- rs764776781

**Related diseases**: 

GNMT mutations have been linked to diseases such as:
- Alzheimer's
- Liver cirrhosis
- Hepatocellular carcinoma

**Treatment and prognosis**: 

There is no current treatment for GNMT gene mutations. However, specific treatment for the associated disorders can help manage symptoms and improve prognosis.

**Drug response**: 

No drugs have been specifically reported to target GNMT mutations.
