## Information about gene SPG23

### Genetic Position
The SPG23 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1p36.32.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SPG23 gene have been linked to Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), an inherited neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. 

### Function
The SPG23 gene encodes a protein known as SPG23/L1AP that is involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It is thought to play a role in the extension and guidance of motor axons during neuronal development.

### AA Mutation List 
The following is a list of known missense mutations in the SPG23 gene:
- p.Leu813Arg (rs144445619)
- p.Leu906Pro
- p.Arg881Trp

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
dbSNP contains many SNVs and InDels for SPG23 gene. Some of them are:
- rs10937144
- rs13316996
- rs13326485

### Related Disease
Mutations in the SPG23 gene are associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), which is a rare neurological disorder affecting the lower limbs.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for HSP, but treatments such as physical therapy, medications for spasticity, and assistive devices can help improve the quality of life of affected individuals.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug treatment available for HSP, but medications for spasticity can help alleviate symptoms.
