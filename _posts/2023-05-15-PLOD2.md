## Gene: PLOD2 

### Information

#### Pathology

PLOD2 (procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2) is a gene that encodes a protein called lysyl hydroxylase 2. This protein is involved in the modification of collagen, an important component of connective tissue. Mutations in PLOD2 have been associated with several human pathologies including Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (KEDS), which is characterized by severe musculoskeletal and vascular complications.

#### Function

The PLOD2 protein is an enzyme involved in the process of post-translational modification of collagen. It is responsible for hydroxylating specific lysine residues in the collagen molecule, which is essential for the proper functioning of the connective tissue.

#### Related Disease

- Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (KEDS)

#### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for KEDS and treatment options are limited to supportive care for the associated symptoms such as pain, joint instability, and fragile skin. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and associated complications.

#### Drug Response

There is no known specific drug treatment for KEDS.
