# Gene GCDH

## Genetic Position
The gene GCDH is located on chromosome 19 at the position 19p13.2-p13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GCDH gene are associated with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GDD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism characterized by accumulation of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid in the brain and other tissues. This leads to neurological symptoms such as dystonia, hypotonia, and seizures, as well as developmental delay and intellectual disability.

## Function
The GCDH gene encodes the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonoyl-CoA in the catabolic pathway of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan.

## AA Mutation List
| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Glu318Lys | Missense | rs137853875 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the GCDH gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
- Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GDD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment involves a low-lysine diet, carnitine supplementation, and intensive neurological management. The long-term prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease, with some patients experiencing only minor symptoms while others may suffer severe neurological impairment.

## Drug Response
No drugs have yet been developed specifically for the treatment of GDD. However, some medications have been used to help manage symptoms of the disease, such as anticonvulsants to control seizures and botulinum toxin injections to address dystonia.
