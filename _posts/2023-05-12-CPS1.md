## Gene CPS1

**Function:** The CPS1 (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1) gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the urea cycle, which eliminates toxic ammonia from the body by converting it to urea. The CPS1 enzyme is mostly synthesized in the liver and is involved in the metabolism of amino acids.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC ID: HGNC:2437
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 1373
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000170478
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 2: 209,804,384-209,844,400
- Aliases: CT, CPS1D, NAGS2

**AA mutation list and mutation type:**

- p.Arg459His - Missense Variant - rs5030868
- p.Arg353Trp - Missense Variant - rs137853219
- p.Gln27* - Nonsense Variant - rs387906677

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the CPS1 gene present in various cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. Here are some of them:

- c.895G>A - Missense Variant - rs147778267
- c.2134A>G - Missense Variant - rs139333941
- c.2873T>C - Missense Variant - rs151233594

**Related Diseases:**

Mutations in CPS1 have been associated with hyperammonemia due to urea cycle disorder, which is a rare inherited disease. Some of the other diseases reported to be associated with CPS1 are Alzheimer's disease and hepatic encephalopathy.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

The treatment of hyperammonemia due to urea cycle disorder includes protein restriction, supplementation with essential amino acids, and medications such as ammonia scavengers, which lower ammonia levels. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be required.

**Drug Response:**

There is no known drug response related to CPS1.
