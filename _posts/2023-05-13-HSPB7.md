# Gene Information for HSPB7

### Pathology

HSPB7 gene encodes heat shock 27kDa protein 7 (HSPB7), which is a small heat shock protein. Studies have shown that variants in HSPB7 have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). 

### Function

HSPB7 is thought to be involved in the response to stress. It has also been suggested that it plays a role in the regulation of the contractile apparatus. The protein may regulate myocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of proapoptotic proteins.

### External IDs

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for this gene.

### Related Disease

Variants in HSPB7 have been associated with the development of familial DCM. DCM is a cardiac disease where the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently, leading to heart failure.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for DCM involves medication to manage symptoms and prevent further damage to the heart. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be necessary. The prognosis for DCM varies and depends on the extent of the damage to the heart and how well it responds to treatment.

### Drug Response

There is no reported drug response associated with variants in this gene.
