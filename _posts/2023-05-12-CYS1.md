# Gene CYS1 

## Genetic Position
The gene CYS1 is located on chromosome 8 at position 8q24.3. 

## Pathology 
Research has shown that mutations in the CYS1 gene can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and other types of cancer. 

## Function 
The CYS1 gene encodes for cystathionine gamma-lyase, which is involved in the transsulfuration pathway of methionine metabolism.

## Related Disease
Polymorphisms in the CYS1 gene have been associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer. 

## Treatment and Prognosis 
Research is ongoing to determine if targeting the transsulfuration pathway, which includes the CYS1 gene, can be an effective treatment for cancer. Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and individual factors. 

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the CYS1 gene.
