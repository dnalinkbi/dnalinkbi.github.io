# Information about gene EGFR

## Genetic Position
EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 at position 7p11.2.

## Pathology
EGFR is involved in regulating cell growth and division. Mutations in the EGFR gene can cause the protein to be overexpressed or constitutively activated, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.

## Function for gene
EGFR is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding to ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). It is involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival.

## Related Disease

EGFR mutations are commonly found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with increased tumor growth and survival. EGFR mutations have also been identified in other cancer types, including breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib have been developed to treat EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, not all patients respond to these treatments, and resistance can develop over time.

## Drug Response

EGFR inhibitors have been shown to improve overall survival in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, response rates vary between individuals, and resistance can develop over time.
