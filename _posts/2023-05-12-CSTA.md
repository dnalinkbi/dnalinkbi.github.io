## Gene CSTA

- ### Function
  The gene CSTA (cystatin A) encodes for a protease inhibitor involved in regulating proteolysis. It mainly functions in the skin, where it plays a role in epithelial development, differentiation, and maintenance. It has been suggested that CSTA may also have a role in immune responses and tumorigenesis.
