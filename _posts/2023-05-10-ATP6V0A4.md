## Gene: ATP6V0A4

### Genetic Position
The ATP6V0A4 gene is located on chromosome 7, specifically at 7q34.

### Pathology
Mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene have been associated with several renal disorders, including distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) and a rare autosomal recessive disorder called familial distal renal tubular acidosis with deafness (FRTAD).

### Function 
The ATP6V0A4 gene encodes a protein called vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) which is involved in acidifying intracellular compartments in various tissues, including the renal tubules. It is particularly important in the alpha-intercalated cells of the collecting ducts of the kidney, where it is responsible for the secretion of acid into the urine.

### Related Disease
- Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA)
- Familial Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis with Deafness (FRTAD)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for dRTA aims at treating the underlying causes and symptoms. This includes the use of bicarbonate replacement therapy to restore the blood pH level. For FRTAD, hearing aids are commonly used to manage hearing loss, and alkaline therapy can improve bone disease.

### Drug Response
Thiazide diuretics have been shown to be effective in treating dRTA by reducing the levels of calcium and potassium in the urine.
