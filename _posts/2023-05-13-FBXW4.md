## Gene FBXW4

### Genetic Position

FBXW4, also known as F-box and WD repeat domain containing 4, is located in chromosome 10q24.32.

### Pathology

Research has shown that FBXW4 could play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Dysregulation of FBXW4 has been associated with various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and others.

### Function

FBXW4 encodes an F-box protein, which is a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that selectively targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. The protein is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation.
