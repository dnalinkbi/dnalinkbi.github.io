# Information about gene ARID1A 

## Genetic position
- ARID1A (AT-Rich Interaction Domain 1A) is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.11 (1p36.11).

## Pathology
- ARID1A is a tumor suppressor gene that helps regulate the expression of other genes that control cell growth and division. Mutations in ARID1A have been found in various types of cancer, including ovarian, endometrial, gastric, and colorectal cancers.

## Function
- ARID1A encodes a protein that is a component of a complex involved in gene expression regulation. The protein interacts with several other proteins in the complex to help control chromatin structure and gene expression. 

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 8289
- HGNC ID: HGNC:15825
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000117713
- OMIM ID: 603024
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8NFD5
- Other aliases: BAF250A, OSA1, P270

## Related diseases
- Ovarian cancer
- Endometrial cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Gastric cancer

## Treatment and prognosis
- The prognosis for patients with ARID1A-mutated cancer varies depending on the type and stage of the cancer. There is currently no specific treatment for cancers with ARID1A mutations, but research is ongoing to develop targeted therapies.

## Drug response
- There is limited information available on drug response specifically related to ARID1A mutations.
