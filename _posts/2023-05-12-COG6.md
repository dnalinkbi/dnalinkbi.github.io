## Gene: COG6

### Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 13
- Start Position: 26093248 bp
- End Position: 26131205 bp

### Pathology

COG6 gene mutations have been associated with multiple disorders such as Congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIIC, Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, and Myopathy.

### Function

The COG6 gene encodes for a protein, Golgi complex subunit 6 (COG6), which is a component of the COG complex essential for the function of the Golgi complex and vesicular trafficking.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic mutations were found in COSMIC database.

### Related disease

- Congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIIC
- Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy
- Myopathy

### Treatment and prognosis

There is no cure for congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIIC. The treatment is symptomatic and includes occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. The prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms, but the disease can be life-threatening.

For muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy and myopathy, there is no cure, but the treatment is symptomatic, and physical therapy can help in maintaining muscle strength.

### Drug response

No specific drug treatment is available for COG6 gene mutations.
