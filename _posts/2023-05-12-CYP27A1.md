# Information about gene CYP27A1

## Genetic Position
CYP27A1 is a gene located on chromosome 2q35, from base pair 211,051,130 to 211,065,701 (GRCh38.p13).

## Pathology
Mutations in the CYP27A1 gene are associated with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). This is a rare genetic disorder that affects lipid metabolism and is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in different tissues, primarily the brain and tendons.

## Function
CYP27A1 encodes the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme, which catalyzes the first step in the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis, and is involved in cholesterol homeostasis in the body.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations for CYP27A1 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for CTX, but treatments are available to manage the symptoms of the disease. These include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and bile acid sequestrants, which can reduce the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in the body.

## Drug Response
There are no reported drug responses for CYP27A1 in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB).
