## **Gene NDUFV1**
* **Genetic position**: Chromosome 2, region 2q33.3
* **Pathology**: Mutations in NDUFV1 have been found to cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the way cells produce energy leading to lactic acidosis and neurological problems.
* **Function**: NDUFV1 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I which is involved in electron transport and ATP production in cellular respiration.
* **External IDs**: 
    * Gene ID: 4723
    * Genomic Location: NC_000002.12 (170,411,582 - 170,482,958)
    * Aliases: CI-75K, NDUFV, NUEM, B16.6
* **External Sites**:
    * HGNC: 7695
    * NCBI Entrez: 4723
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000163914
    * OMIM: 157655
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49821
* **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**
    * c.485G>A (p.Gly162Arg) - rs104894175
    * c.884T>C (p.Met295Thr) - rs150407359
* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: No somatic mutations reported in dbSNP.
* **Related disease**: Mitochondrial complex I deficiency, Leigh Syndrome, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy
* **Treatment and prognosis**: There is no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Treatment typically involves symptom management such as controlling lactic acidosis and seizure medications. Prognosis can vary widely depending on the severity of the disease and individual cases.
* **Drug response**: There is no specific drug approved for mitochondrial complex I deficiency but some treatments may have positive effects on certain symptoms.
