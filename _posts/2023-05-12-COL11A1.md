# Gene: COL11A1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1 (1p21.1)
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the COL11A1 gene have been associated with Stickler Syndrome, Marshall Syndrome, and Fibrochondrogenesis 2.
- **Function:** The COL11A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 chain of type XI collagen, which is found in cartilage and other connective tissues. This protein helps to give strength and support to these tissues.
