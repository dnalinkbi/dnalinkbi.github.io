# Information about gene RPL11

## Genetic Position
The RPL11 gene is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.11.

## Pathology and Function
The RPL11 gene encodes for the ribosomal protein L11, a component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome. Ribosomal proteins are essential for protein synthesis. Mutations in the RPL11 gene have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells, causing anemia.

## Related Disease
Diamond-Blackfan anemia 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for DBA includes corticosteroid therapy, blood transfusions, and stem-cell transplantation. Prognosis for patients with DBA varies based on the severity of their condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response for DBA patients. However, recent studies have shown that some patients respond to treatment with lenalidomide, a drug that stimulates erythropoiesis.
