# Information for Gene GDAP1

## Genetic Position
- **Gene Name:** Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1)
- **Chromosome:** 8
- **Locus:** 8q13.3
- **Genetic Variation:** NG_009004.1:g.32888G>A
- **Mutations:** various

## Pathology and Function

### Pathology
Mutations in the GDAP1 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. CMT is a hereditary disorder that affects the nerves in the arms and legs.

### Function
GDAP1 encodes a mitochondrial protein that has been shown to be involved in the maintenance of the mitochondrial network and dynamics. It appears to be important in ensuring normal mitochondrial function in nervous tissue.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are a number of amino acid (AA) mutations in GDAP1 that are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Some of these mutations, along with their mutation types and corresponding dbSNP IDs, are listed below:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Arg120Trp | Missense | rs80338927 |
| Arg120Gln | Missense | rs80338928 |
| Thr157Asn | Missense | rs80338929 |
| Tyr142* | Nonsense | rs80338930 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels of GDAP1 with dbSNP ID currently known.

## Related Disease
The mutations in GDAP1 have been implicated causally in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). CMT is a hereditary neurological disorder.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CMT, and treatment is mainly symptomatic, focusing on pain management and physical therapy to maintain remaining muscle strength and range of motion. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the specific mutation involved.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that can cure or halt the progression of CMT.
