## Gene Information

**Gene symbol:** UBA1  
**Gene name:** Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1  
**Chromosome location:** Xp11.23  
**Aliases:** UBE1, A1S9T, X-ALD, SMAX2H, UKL1, AMPYL1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)  

## Function for Gene

UBA1 encodes a member of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme family. The enzyme plays a key role in regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for targeted protein degradation. UBA1 catalyzes the first step in the ubiquitination process, covalently binding ubiquitin to target proteins. Dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for UBA1.

## Related Disease

Mutations in UBA1 have been associated with X-linked recessive disorders, including X-linked Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) and X-linked Infantile Spinal Muscular Atrophy (XSMA) type 2.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for SMA-PME and XSMA type 2. Treatment options are generally supportive and symptomatic, with a focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.
