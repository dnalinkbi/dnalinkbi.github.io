# Gene: SLC6A8

## Information about gene
SLC6A8 is a gene that encodes a protein called creatine transporter 1 (CRT), which is primarily found in the brain and muscles. The CRT protein is responsible for the transport of creatine into cells, where it is used for energy production.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for SLC6A8 in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mutations in SLC6A8 have been associated with creatine deficiency syndrome (CDS), which is characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for creatine deficiency syndrome. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms and may include speech therapy, physical therapy, and medications to control seizures. The long-term prognosis for individuals with CDS varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response specific to SLC6A8 mutations.
