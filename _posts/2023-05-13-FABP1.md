## Gene Information

**Gene:** FABP1

**Function:** FABP1 encodes for the liver fatty acid-binding protein, which is involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC ID: 3501
- NCBI Entrez ID: 2167
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000113522
- OMIM ID: 134650
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P07148
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 2q35

**Aliases:** L-FABP, FABPL

**AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

- p.Ala54Thr (rs2241883)
- p.Leu94Val (rs140141965)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- c.308T>C (rs2071422)
- c.487C>T (rs2071423)

**Related Disease:**

- Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Cardiovascular diseases

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Currently, there are no specific treatments for FABP1-related disorders. However, lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and improving diet, are recommended to manage NAFLD. The prognosis and treatment of HCC and cardiovascular diseases are managed based on individual patient needs and severity.

**Drug Response:**

Studies have suggested that drugs targeting FABP1 may have potential therapeutic benefits in NAFLD and HCC treatment.
