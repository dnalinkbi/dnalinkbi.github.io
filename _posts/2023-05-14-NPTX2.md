## Gene NPTX2 information

### Genetic position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic position:** Gene NPTX2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31.1).

**Pathology:** NPTX2 has been associated with Alzheimer's disease, as well as other cognitive disorders. Some studies have suggested that the gene may play a role in the development of synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation, which are important for learning and memory.

**Function for gene:** NPTX2 encodes a neuronal protein called Neuronal Pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), which is a member of the pentraxin protein family. NPTX2 is expressed in the brain, where it is thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity, and may be involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses.
