## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** ST6GALNAC2

**Function:** The ST6GALNAC2 gene encodes for a sialyltransferase enzyme that adds a specific sugar residue to glycoproteins and glycolipids known as N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). This sugar residue addition is called sialylation and plays a role in cell-to-cell interactions and cell signaling pathways.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**
- HGNC ID: 11425
- NCBI Entrez ID: 98
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000114251
- OMIM ID: 606863
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8IXQ2
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q25.1

**Aliases:** 
- SIATNA2
- SIAT4E
- ST6GalNAc-II

## Related Disease, Treatment, and Prognosis

**Related Disease:** ST6GALNAC2 mutations have been associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment options for cancer associated with ST6GALNAC2 mutations vary depending on the type and stage of cancer. Prognosis is also dependent on these factors, as well as the individual's response to treatment.

**Drug Response:** The ST6GALNAC2 gene has been found to play a role in the response of certain cancer types to chemotherapy, specifically in breast cancer. However, more research is needed in this area.
