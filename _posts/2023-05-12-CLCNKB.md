# Gene: CLCNKB

### Gene Function:
The CLCNKB gene encodes a voltage-gated chloride channel protein that regulates chloride reabsorption in the kidneys, specifically in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. The protein is involved in maintaining the acid-base and electrolyte balance in the body.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for this gene.

### Related Disease:
Mutations in the CLCNKB gene are associated with a rare genetic disorder called familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC). FHHNC is characterized by a combination of low magnesium levels in the blood, high levels of calcium in the urine, and kidney stones.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment for FHHNC is mainly supportive and focuses on controlling the symptoms. Patients may require supplementation with magnesium and a low-calcium diet to prevent further kidney stone formation. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the presence of complications such as chronic renal failure.

### Drug Response:
There is no specific drug therapy for FHHNC. Treatment is primarily aimed at symptom control, such as reducing calcium levels in the urine and preventing kidney stone formation.
