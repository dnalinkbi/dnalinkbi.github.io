# Information about Gene A4GALT

## Genetic Position and Pathology

A4GALT gene is located on chromosome 22 at the location q13.2. It encodes the enzyme alpha-1,4-galactosyltransferase which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as the i (inverted) phenotype, which is characterized by the absence of the I antigen on the surface of red blood cells and the presence of a precursor substance.

## Function for Gene

The protein encoded by A4GALT gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 6 family and catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) sequence. This protein is responsible for the biosynthesis of Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R, a type 1 chain blood group antigen found on erythrocytes and the basement membranes of epithelial cells.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

A number of mutations have been identified in the A4GALT gene, including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and splice site mutations. Some of the missense mutations include p.Tyr229Cys, p.Tyr261Cys, and p.Gly313Ser. The dbSNP IDs for these mutations are rs121908710, rs121908709, and rs121908707, respectively.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the A4GALT gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the A4GALT gene have been associated with the rare autosomal recessive disorder known as the i (inverted) phenotype, which is characterized by the absence of the I antigen on the surface of red blood cells. This condition is usually benign, but can sometimes cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no current cure for the i phenotype or any specific treatment for A4GALT gene mutations. Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis for individuals with this condition is usually good.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available on drug response and A4GALT gene mutations.
