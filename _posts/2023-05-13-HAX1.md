# Information about Gene HAX1

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

**Genetic position:** HAX1 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.22.

**Pathology:** Mutations in HAX1 gene have been associated with various diseases including neutropenia, which is a rare blood disorder characterized by a decrease in the number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell).

**Function:** The HAX1 gene encodes the protein HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1), which is involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell migration, proliferation, and survival.

## Gene information

**Function for gene:** The HAX1 gene encodes the protein HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1), which plays a role in various cellular processes including cell migration, proliferation, and survival.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

There are various AA mutations reported in the HAX1 gene. Some of them are:

- **p.Arg36Gly:** This mutation is associated with autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia (ARCN).
- **p.Pro22Leu:** This mutation is associated with cyclic neutropenia.
- **p.Tyr18Ter:** This mutation is associated with Kostmann disease.

These mutations are reported in dbSNP with the following IDs:

- rs137854339
- rs746074666
- rs137854280

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the HAX1 gene in various cancer types. Some of them are:

- **rs1221387897:** This somatic mutation is reported in liver cancer.
- **rs767896309:** This somatic mutation is reported in breast cancer.

**Related disease:**

Mutations in the HAX1 gene have been associated with various diseases including:

- Neutropenia
- Kostmann disease
- Cyclic neutropenia
- Severe congenital neutropenia

**Treatment and prognosis:**

Treatment options for neutropenia vary depending on the severity and cause of the condition. Patients may receive antibiotics to prevent infections and sometimes bone marrow transplants are necessary. The prognosis for patients with neutropenia varies depending on the severity and cause of the condition.

**Drug response:**

There is limited information available regarding drug response related to mutations in the HAX1 gene.
