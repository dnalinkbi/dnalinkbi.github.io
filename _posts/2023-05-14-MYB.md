## Gene: MYB

### Genomic location:
Chromosome 6: 135,299,778-135,385,947

### Function:
The MYB gene encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is also involved in the regulation of several cellular processes such as development, differentiation, hematopoiesis, and immune function.
