# Gene PRSS1

**Function:** The PRSS1 gene codes for a digestive enzyme known as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. It is primarily involved in the digestion and metabolism of proteins in the small intestine.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 9449
- NCBI Entrez: 5644
- Ensembl: ENSG00000153885
- OMIM: 276000
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07477

**Aliases:** 

- TRY1
- TRYP1
- Trypsin-1

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

- R122H (rs11209026) - Missense mutation
- N29I (rs587776861) - Missense mutation
- A16V (rs758697152) - Missense mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- Not applicable

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the PRSS1 gene have been linked to hereditary pancreatitis, a condition which causes inflammation and damage to the pancreas.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment of hereditary pancreatitis generally involves managing symptoms, such as pain and digestive problems. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. The prognosis is dependent on the severity of the disease and response to treatment.

**Drug Response:** Not applicable
