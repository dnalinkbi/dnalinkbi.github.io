# Gene HLCS

## Genetic position
The HLCS (holocarboxylase synthetase) gene is located on chromosome 21q22.11, specifically from base pair 34,189,146 to base pair 34,227,321.

## Pathology
HLCS mutations have been identified as the cause of multiple carboxylase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder. This disorder involves the impaired activity of biotin-dependent enzymes and can result in symptoms such as seizures, respiratory distress, lethargy, vomiting, and coma. Additionally, a link between mutations in the HLCS gene and an increased risk of several cancers has been identified.

## Function
The HLCS gene encodes the enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase, which is responsible for the activation of biotin-dependent enzymes. This activation occurs through the covalent attachment of biotin to the proteins, allowing them to function properly.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- c.1010G>A, p.G337R (dbSNP: rs1805321)
- c.842C>T, p.R281W (dbSNP: rs1805311)
- c.940G>A, p.G314D (dbSNP: rs1805352)

All listed mutations are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the HLCS gene.

## Related disease
As mentioned, mutations in the HLCS gene can cause multiple carboxylase deficiency. The severity of this disorder varies widely, with some individuals experiencing a mild and intermittent course, while others suffer from severe and life-threatening symptoms.

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment of multiple carboxylase deficiency generally involves the administration of biotin, either orally or intravenously. In some cases, the supplementation of other vitamins and restriction of specific amino acids may be advised. Treatment typically results in the resolution of symptoms, but long-term outcomes remain highly variable.

## Drug response
There is limited research on the drug response of patients with HLCS mutations, but it is generally believed that biotin therapy is a cornerstone of treatment.
