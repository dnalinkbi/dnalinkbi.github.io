## Information on Gene HOXD10

### Position, Pathology and Function

HOXD10 is a gene that is located on chromosome 2 at the genetic position 2q31-q32. It is involved in the development of various tissues and organs, including the limbs, reproductive system, and central nervous system. It plays a crucial role in the development of the thoracic cage, vertebral column, and limbs.

There are several pathologies associated with HOXD10, including developmental defects like synpolydactyly and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. HOXD10 has also been implicated in various types of cancer, including lung and breast cancer.

### Function

HOXD10 is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. It functions as a transcription factor, which means that it binds to DNA and controls the activity of other genes. It is particularly important in the early stages of embryonic development, where it helps to establish the body plan of the developing embryo.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several AA mutations associated with HOXD10 in various diseases. Here are a few examples:

- Lys38Asn (dbSNP ID: rs147752532): This mutation is associated with synpolydactyly, a congenital disorder that affects the fingers and toes. It is thought to disrupt the DNA binding ability of HOXD10.
- Ile54Asn (dbSNP ID: rs267606992): This mutation is also associated with synpolydactyly. It is thought to affect the stability of the HOXD10 protein, leading to a loss of function.
- Arg320Gln (dbSNP ID: rs373826244): This mutation is associated with breast cancer. It is thought to disrupt the normal function of HOXD10 in regulating gene expression.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations associated with HOXD10 in various types of cancer. Examples include:

- SNP rs373826244: This mutation has been identified in breast cancer and is thought to affect the function of HOXD10 in tumor suppression.
- InDel rs1057519404: This indel has been identified in lung adenocarcinoma and is thought to disrupt the DNA binding ability of HOXD10.

### Related Diseases

There are several diseases associated with mutations in HOXD10. These include:

- Synpolydactyly
- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
- Breast cancer
- Lung cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for mutations in HOXD10 depend on the specific disease. For developmental defects like synpolydactyly and congenital diaphragmatic hernia, treatment may involve surgery to correct the defect. In cancer, treatment may involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, depending on the stage and type of cancer.

### Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response in patients with mutations in HOXD10. However, some studies have suggested that targeting HOXD10 in cancer may be a promising therapeutic approach.
