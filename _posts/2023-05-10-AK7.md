# Gene: AK7

## Genetic Position
- AK7 gene is located on chromosome 10 at the position 10q26.11.

## Pathology and Function
- The exact function of the AK7 gene is not yet known, but it is believed that it plays a role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
- Studies suggest that mutations in the AK7 gene can cause mitochondrial defects and lead to neurodegenerative disorders.
