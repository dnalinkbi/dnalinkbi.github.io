# Gene: OCA2

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 15: 28,016,766-28,209,987 
- **Pathology:** OCA2 mutations can lead to a reduced or absent production of melanin, causing oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2)
- **Function:** OCA2 encodes a protein that regulates melanin synthesis and is involved in the formation and maturation of melanosomes in melanocytes. 

## IDs and Aliases
- **Gene ID:** 4948 
- **Genomic location:** NC_000015.10 
- **Aliases:** P, OA2, OCA type 2 protein, P 
- **External IDs:** 
  - HGNC: 7946 
  - NCBI Entrez: 4948 
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000164378 
  - OMIM: 611409 
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q04671 

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list:** A list of amino acid changes can be found on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot page for OCA2 
- **Mutation type:** Missense, nonsense, frameshift 
- **dbSNP ID:** rs1800401, rs1800407, rs74653330 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- Currently no somatic SNVs/InDels are recorded in COSMIC or cBioPortal for OCA2

## Related Diseases
- **Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2):** A rare genetic condition where individuals have little or no melanin pigment in their hair, skin, and eyes. It is caused by mutations in the OCA2 gene. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for OCA2, but treatment can include vision correction, sunscreen use, and avoiding excessive exposure to sunlight. 
- Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition, but OCA2 is typically a lifelong condition. 

## Drug Response
- Currently, there are no drugs specifically developed for the treatment of OCA2.
