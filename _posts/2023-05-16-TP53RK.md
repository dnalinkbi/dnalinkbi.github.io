## Information about gene TP53RK

### Genetic Position:
The TP53RK gene is located on chromosome 20 at position 20q11.2.

### Pathology:
The TP53RK gene is associated with various tumors including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.

### Function:
TP53RK is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a role in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis.
