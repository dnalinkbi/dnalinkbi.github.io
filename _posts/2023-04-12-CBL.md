# Information on Gene CBL

## Gene Position

The gene CBL is located on chromosome 11 at position 11q23.3.

## Pathology

CBL has been linked to numerous cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and others. Mutations in the CBL gene have been associated with the development of various cancers, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

## Function

CBL is a proto-oncogene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell signaling and growth. It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which facilitates the degradation of target proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CBL is also involved in several signaling pathways, including Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Two common missense mutations in CBL are:

- p.N454D (rs33935127)
- p.Q367P

They are associated with Noonan syndrome and related disorders.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have been identified in CBL, including:

- c.1119_1120delGA (rs104894340)
- c.2452G>A
- c.2513G>T (rs147407366)

## Related Disease

Mutations in CBL have been associated with various disorders, including:

- Noonan syndrome
- Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
- Acute myeloid leukemia
- Lung cancer
- Breast cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific therapies targeted towards CBL mutations. Treatment options are generally based on the specific cancer type and may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.

## Drug Response

There is limited data on drug response related to CBL mutations.
