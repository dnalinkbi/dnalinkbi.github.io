# Gene ENG

## Genetic Position

The ENG gene is located on chromosome 9q34.11.

## Pathology

Mutations in the ENG gene are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. HHT is an inherited disorder that affects blood vessels, leading to abnormal bleeding and the formation of small, abnormal blood vessels called telangiectasias.

## Function

The ENG gene provides instructions for making a protein called endoglin. This protein has several functions, including helping to form and maintain normal blood vessels, regulating the growth and differentiation of certain cells, and modulating inflammation and immunity.

## Related Disease

As mentioned above, mutations in the ENG gene are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for HHT may involve surgical interventions to control bleeding and/or medications to reduce symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and its associated complications.

## Drug Response

There is limited information on drug response for HHT treatment. However, anti-angiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab and thalidomide have shown promise in early clinical trials.
