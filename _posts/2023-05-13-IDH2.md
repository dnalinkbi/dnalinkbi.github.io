# Genetic Information about Gene IDH2

## General Information
- **Gene Name:** IDH2
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 15q26.1
- **Function:** The IDH2 gene encodes an enzyme called isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and CO2. This enzyme is involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism.
- **Aliases:** ICD-M, IDHM, IDP, IDP-2, IVD, isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP], mitochondrial

## External IDs and Websites
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:5382
- **NCBI Entrez ID:** 3418
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000182054
- **OMIM ID:** 147650
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** P48735

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are several reported mutations in the IDH2 gene, including R140Q, R140W, and R172K. 
- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs115415660, rs121913527, rs121913528

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs136571738, rs138551844, rs139702255, rs143158181, rs143767290, rs146889356, rs150414318, rs16859182, rs183666155, rs186460958, rs187157358

## Related Diseases
- IDH2 mutations have been linked to several diseases, including:
    - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
    - Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL)
    - Cholangiocarcinoma 
    - Glioma
    - Ovarian cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Targeted therapies aimed at IDH2 mutations are currently being developed and tested in clinical trials for various types of cancer.
- The prognosis for patients with IDH2 mutations depends on the specific disease and mutation type, as well as other factors such as age and overall health.

## Drug Response
- Ivosidenib (Tibsovo) and enasidenib (Idhifa) are small molecule inhibitors that target mutant forms of IDH2 and have been approved for the treatment of AML with IDH2 mutations.
