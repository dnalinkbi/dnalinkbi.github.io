# Information about Gene HSD11B2

## Genetic Position
The HSD11B2 gene is located on chromosome 16q22.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the HSD11B2 gene have been associated with hypertension, increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy, and in some cases, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

## Function
The HSD11B2 gene encodes an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2), which is responsible for converting the active form of cortisol (cortisol) to its inactive form (cortisone) in the kidney and placenta. The enzyme helps to regulate the levels of cortisol in the body, preventing excessive cortisol activity, which can lead to a variety of health issues.

- Hypertension
- Preeclampsia
- Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for individuals with mutations in the HSD11B2 gene typically involves managing symptoms and complications associated with hypertension, such as heart disease and stroke. Prognosis varies depending on the specific mutation and its effects on the body.

## Drug Response
Individuals with mutations in HSD11B2 may respond differently to certain medications, particularly those that affect cortisol metabolism.
