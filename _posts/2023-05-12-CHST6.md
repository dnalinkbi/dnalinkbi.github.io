### Gene: CHST6
- Function: The CHST6 gene encodes for an enzyme called corneal N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfotransferase, which belongs to the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme modifies corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans, which are essential for corneal transparency and function.
- Genomic location: Chromosome 16q22.3
- External IDs:
  - HGNC: 20088
  - NCBI Entrez: 23535
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000188340
  - OMIM: 605294
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6M4
- Aliases: C-GlcNAc6ST, GST-4, KSPG sulfotransferase, keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase 1
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
  - p.Arg364Trp, missense variant, rs121908027
  - p.Arg222Trp, missense variant, rs121908028
  - p.Arg71Gly, missense variant, rs267606925
  - p.Ala63Thr, missense variant, rs138942760
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported
- Related disease: Mutations in the CHST6 gene are associated with an autosomal recessive disorder called macular corneal dystrophy (MCD). MCD is a rare, progressive disease that affects the cornea, leading to visual impairment and blindness. 
- Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no cure for MCD. Treatment involves managing symptoms through surgical interventions like corneal transplantation. The prognosis for MCD varies from individual to individual, with some having a relatively stable disease progression and others experiencing rapid visual decline. 
- Drug response: No drugs have been specifically developed for the treatment of MCD.
