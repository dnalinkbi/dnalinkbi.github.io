# Gene Information: ALDOA

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 16
- Genomic Coordinates: 1,259,266-1,287,933

## Pathology
ALDOA is known to be associated with several diseases such as:
- Glycogen Storage Disease XIII
- Hereditary Erythrocyte Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency
- Fluoride Poisoning
- Alzheimer Disease Type 2

## Function 
ALDOA encodes for aldolase A, which is the muscle-specific isoform of aldolase enzyme that catalyzes the fourth step in glycolysis. It plays an essential role in metabolism by converting glucose to pyruvate.

## Related Diseases
- Glycogen storage disease XIII
- Hereditary erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency
- Fluoride poisoning
- Alzheimer disease type 2

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for glycogen storage disease XIII or hereditary erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. Treatment is generally symptomatic. 
- Fluoride poisoning usually requires immediate medical attention. 
- Treatment for Alzheimer disease type 2 is symptomatic, with a focus on managing symptoms and improving the patientâ€™s quality of life.

## Drug Response
- There is no known drug response for ALDOA gene.
