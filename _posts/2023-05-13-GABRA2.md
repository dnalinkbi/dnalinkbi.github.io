# Information about Gene GABRA2

## Genetic Position and General Information
- GABRA2 is located on chromosome 4q12 and spans 88,970 base pairs (bp).
- The gene is also known as Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2 (GABA-A receptor alpha-2) and is a protein-coding gene.
- External IDs for the gene:
    - HGNC: 4145
    - NCBI Entrez: 2555
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000117318
    - OMIM: 137140
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P47869

## Function for Gene
- GABRA2 encodes for a protein that is a subunit of the GABA-A receptor.
- The receptor is involved in the neurotransmission process, specifically in mediating the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
- The gene also plays a role in the regulation of alcohol consumption and addiction.
- Mutations in GABRA2 have been associated with susceptibility to alcohol dependence.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Some of the known variations/mutations in GABRA2 and their corresponding dbSNP ID are as follows:
    - rs11503014: p.Ala273Val, Missense Variant
    - rs1808850: p.His101Arg, Missense Variant
    - rs2066702: p.Pro28Thr, Missense Variant
    - rs2229944: p.Ser8Ala, Missense Variant

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in GABRA2 to date.

## Related Disease
- Alcohol Dependence: Mutations in GABRA2 have been associated with an increased risk of alcohol dependence.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment of alcohol dependence typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, medications, and support groups.
- The prognosis depends on various factors, including the severity of the addiction, the presence of co-occurring mental health conditions, and the individual's willingness to seek and comply with treatment.

## Drug Response
- Some studies have reported a potential role of GABRA2 in predicting individual responses to pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence.
