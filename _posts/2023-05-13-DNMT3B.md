# Information about Gene DNMT3B

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Locus: p12.3
- Genomic position: 10,732,976 - 10,752,330 bp

## Pathology
DNMT3B gene is associated with various pathologies, including:

- Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies syndrome (ICF syndrome)
- Hypomethylation at pericentromeric satellite regions
- Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation
- Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes

## Function
DNMT3B gene encodes for a DNA methyltransferase enzyme, which catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group to cytosine residues in DNA, leading to DNA methylation and gene silencing. DNMT3B is involved in de novo DNA methylation and mainly targets the unmethylated CpG islands in DNA.

## Related Disease
DNMT3B gene mutations have been linked to the following disease:
- Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies syndrome (ICF syndrome)
- Colorectal cancer
- Breast cancer
- Lung cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
As DNMT3B is involved in the epigenetic changes that lead to the development of cancer, drugs targeting DNMT3B could potentially be used in cancer treatment. However, more research is needed in this area.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug responses related to DNMT3B mutations.
