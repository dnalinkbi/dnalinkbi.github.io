# Information about Gene POMGNT2

## Genetic Position
The POMGNT2 (protein O-linked mannose N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2) gene is located at chromosome 3p21.31.

## Pathology
Mutations in POMGNT2 are associated with congenital muscular dystrophy with mental retardation and structural brain abnormalities (CMD-MR), a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and intellectual disability.

## Function
The POMGNT2 gene encodes for a protein that plays a key role in the synthesis of glycosylated α-dystroglycan (α-DG). α-DG is a protein that is important for muscle and brain development, and mutations in POMGNT2 result in defective α-DG glycosylation, leading to the symptoms of CMD-MR.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID reported for POMGNT2.

## Related Disease
Mutations in POMGNT2 are associated with congenital muscular dystrophy with mental retardation and structural brain abnormalities (CMD-MR).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CMD-MR and treatment mainly involves reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and mobility aids such as wheelchairs can be used to manage muscle weakness. The prognosis of CMD-MR varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response for CMD-MR associated with mutations in POMGNT2.
