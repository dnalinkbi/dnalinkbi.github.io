## Gene Information - NHP2

### Genetic Position
The NHP2 gene is located on chromosome 5q35.3.

### Pathology
Mutations in this gene have been associated with dyskeratosis congenita, a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and mucosal leukoplakia.

### Function
The NHP2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex involved in ribosome biogenesis. The protein is necessary for the pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNA.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the NHP2 gene have been associated with dyskeratosis congenita, a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and mucosal leukoplakia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for dyskeratosis congenita. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and complications of the disease. The prognosis for individuals with dyskeratosis congenita varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and the extent of organ involvement.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug for NHP2 gene mutations.
