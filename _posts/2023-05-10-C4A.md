# Information about Gene C4A

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: C4A gene is located on chromosome 6 at position 6p21.3.

- **Pathology**: C4A gene is associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Function**: C4A gene encodes a member of the complement system, which plays a critical role in the immune response. Specifically, C4A is involved in the formation of the classical complement pathway that leads to the destruction of invading pathogens and enhancement of phagocytosis.

## Gene Information

- **Function**: Complement C4-A is a protein involved in the classical complement pathway. It is responsible for the antigen-antibody complex recognition and clearance.

- **Aliases**: C4A, COM4, CPAMD2, C4, CPAMD3

- **External IDs and Genomic Location**: 

  - HGNC ID: 1966
  - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 721
  - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000205383
  - OMIM ID: 120810
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P0C0L4
  - Genomic Location: Chr6:31,096,875-31,135,135

## Mutations and Variation Information

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in C4A gene.

## Related Disease

C4A gene is associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as:

- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic sclerosis
- Primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome
- Cold urticarial

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the associated disease. However, current research suggests that targeting complement system might offer beneficial effects towards treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

## Drug Response

There is currently limited information on drug response specific to genetic variants in C4A gene. However, some studies have shown the potential of complement inhibition in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that are associated with C4A gene.
