### Information about Gene HEXB

- **Genetic Position:** HEXB gene is located on chromosome 5q13.3.

- **Pathology:** HEXB gene encodes beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta, which is one of the three subunits of the beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme. Mutations in HEXB gene are associated with various lysosomal storage disorders, including Sandhoff disease, GM2-gangliosidosis, and Tay-Sachs disease.

- **Function:** The beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of ganglioside GM2 to yield GM3 and a hydrolyzed product. This enzyme plays a crucial role in ganglioside catabolism, particularly in the brain, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons, resulting in neurodegeneration.

- **External IDs and Aliases:** HEXB gene has the following external IDs: HGNC:4870, NCBI Entrez Gene: 3073, Ensembl: ENSG00000113520, OMIM: 606873, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07686. The aliases for HEXB gene include: HexB, beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase subunit beta.

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID:** HEXB gene mutations have been reported in various types, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations. Some of the most frequent mutations in HEXB gene and their dbSNP IDs are as follows: 
    - c.1528T>C (p.Leu510Pro) rs121918104
    - c.1411+1G>A rs782055424
    - c.1383C>T (p.Arg461Ter) rs121918103
    - c.1192G>A (p.Arg398Gln) rs1554652120
    - c.631C>T (p.Arg211Ter) rs139062286

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the HEXB gene, and some of them with their dbSNP IDs are as follows:
    - c.1117C>A (p.Ser373Ter) rs1057519695
    - c.1000C>A (p.Ala334Asp) rs746183033
    - c.1020C>G (p.Ser341Cys) rs147803979

- **Related Disease:** HEXB gene mutations are associated with various lysosomal storage disorders, including: 
    - Sandhoff disease
    - GM2-gangliosidosis
    - Tay-Sachs disease

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There are currently no specific treatments available for HEXB-related diseases, and treatment is mainly symptomatic. The prognosis for patients with HEXB-related diseases depends on the severity of symptoms and the age of onset. 

- **Drug Response:** There are currently no drugs specifically targeted for the treatment of HEXB-related diseases. However, studies are ongoing to investigate the potential efficacy of various drugs, including enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy.
