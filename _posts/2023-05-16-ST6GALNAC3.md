## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** ST6GALNAC3

**Function:** ST6GALNAC3 encodes for a sialyltransferase, which is an enzyme that adds a sialic acid sugar molecule to proteins and lipids.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 30180
- NCBI Entrez: 340611
- Ensembl: ENSG00000158409
- OMIM: 610637
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NFW8
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 16q12.2

**Aliases:** SIAT4D

## Mutations

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:**

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) recorded in the dbSNP database for ST6GALNAC3. Here are some of the common ones:

- R46W (rs113272572): missense mutation causing an amino acid change from arginine (R) to tryptophan (W) at position 46.
- R88Q (rs3733691): missense mutation causing an amino acid change from arginine (R) to glutamine (Q) at position 88.
- V230I (rs117501612): missense mutation causing an amino acid change from valine (V) to isoleucine (I) at position 230.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID recorded for ST6GALNAC3.

## Related Diseases

A few studies have suggested that mutations in ST6GALNAC3 may be associated with certain diseases, although more research is needed to establish causality. Here are some of the diseases that have been associated with ST6GALNAC3:

- Breast cancer: One study found that higher levels of ST6GALNAC3 expression were associated with poorer survival outcomes in breast cancer patients.
- Cardiovascular disease: Another study found that a certain SNP in ST6GALNAC3 was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in women.
- Schizophrenia: A genome-wide association study identified a SNP in ST6GALNAC3 that was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.

## Treatment and Prognosis

As of now, there are no specific treatments available that target ST6GALNAC3. However, understanding the role of ST6GALNAC3 in disease progression could potentially lead to the development of targeted therapies. 

In breast cancer, higher levels of ST6GALNAC3 expression have been associated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating that ST6GALNAC3 may be a potential prognostic marker.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information available regarding drug response for ST6GALNAC3.
