# Gene: SSTR5

## Information

### Pathology
SSTR5, or somatostatin receptor type 5, is a G-protein coupled receptor that is involved in the regulation of hormonal and neuronal signaling. Abnormal expression or mutations in the SSTR5 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, acromegaly, and diabetes.

### Function
SSTR5 is involved in a variety of important physiological processes, including the regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion in the pancreas, the inhibition of growth hormone release in the pituitary gland, and the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain. 

### External IDs
- Gene ID: 6755
- Genomic location: Chromosome 16: 57,324,367-57,337,221
- Aliases: SST5, SS-5-R, SSTR4

### AA Mutation List
There are several known amino acid mutations in SSTR5:
- T59I, rs74315537
- A179V, rs6436318
- V249I, rs1800374
- F331L, rs28933406

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are several known somatic SNVs/InDels in SSTR5. Examples include:
- c.158A>G, rs139188250
- c.236A>G, rs773177026
- c.256C>T, rs777449930

### Related Disease
Abnormal SSTR5 expression or mutations have been associated with various diseases. For example:
- Overexpression of SSTR5 has been linked to the development of certain types of cancer, including neuroendocrine tumors and gliomas.
- Mutations in SSTR5 have been associated with acromegaly, a hormonal disorder that results in excessive growth hormone production.
- Abnormal SSTR5 expression has also been implicated in the development of diabetes.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of SSTR5-related diseases depend on the specific condition. In some cases, drugs that target SSTR5, such as somatostatin analogs, can be used to treat the disease. In other cases, surgical or other interventions may be necessary.

### Drug Response
SSTR5-targeting drugs have been used to treat a variety of conditions, including acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. However, the effectiveness of these drugs can vary depending on the specific disease and individual factors.
