# Information about Gene ANK1

### Genetic Position
- ANK1 (Ankyrin 1) is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8p11.21).
- It spans across 114.2 kb of genomic DNA and consists of 46 exons.

### Pathology and Function
- ANK1 encodes for a protein called AnkyrinR which is a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of erythrocytes and regulating ion channels and transporters in various cells.
- Mutations in ANK1 are associated with various types of hemolytic anemias, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.
- ANK1 mutations can cause impaired binding of AnkyrinR to spectrin and other cytoskeletal proteins, leading to weakened erythrocyte cytoskeleton and membrane instability.
- The dysfunction of ANK1 can also lead to abnormalities in ion transport and cell signaling pathways.

### Function for Gene
- AnkyrinR, the protein encoded by ANK1, acts as a link between erythrocyte membrane proteins and the underlying cytoskeletal network. It facilitates the formation of a structural network that maintains erythrocyte shape, stability, and deformability.
- AnkyrinR also interacts with various ion channels and transporters, such as the anion exchanger 1 (AE1), the Na/K-ATPase, and the voltage-dependent potassium channel (Kv1.4), to regulate their functional expression and subcellular localization.

### AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- ANK1 mutations can lead to amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions in the encoded protein.
- Some examples of ANK1 mutations and their associated dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | rsID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.3765G>A | missense | rs28929480 |
| c.1529G>A | missense | rs199474900 |
| c.142G>A | nonsense | rs201736912 |
| c.2800_2801delAA | frameshift | rs80338778 |
| c.8680dupA | frameshift | rs118203985 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations in ANK1 have been reported in various types of cancers, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and breast cancer.
- Some examples of somatic ANK1 mutations and their associated dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | rsID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.8502C>T | missense | rs7071590 |
| c.3277G>A | missense | rs1160642597 |
| c.7036A>G | silent | rs746764054 |
| c.5126A>C | missense | rs76277580 |

### Related Disease
- ANK1 mutations are associated with various types of hemolytic anemias, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.
- Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that causes the premature destruction of erythrocytes due to their weakened membrane and altered shape.
- Hereditary elliptocytosis is a genetic disorder that causes erythrocytes to have a more elliptical shape than normal, which reduces their deformability and lifespan.
- Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is a rare form of hemolytic anemia that causes erythrocytes to have a fragmented and irregular shape, leading to their rapid destruction and severe anemia.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for ANK1-related anemias may include blood transfusions, splenectomy, and supportive care.
- The prognosis for ANK1-related anemias can vary depending on the severity of the symptoms and the effectiveness of the treatment.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information on the drug response of ANK1-related anemias, as they are mostly managed through supportive care and surgery.
- However, some studies have suggested that certain drugs, such as simvastatin and valproic acid, may have a beneficial effect on erythrocyte membrane stability in hereditary spherocytosis.
