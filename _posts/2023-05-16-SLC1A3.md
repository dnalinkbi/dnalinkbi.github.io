# Information about Gene SLC1A3

**Genetic Position**: SLC1A3 is located on chromosome 5q31.

**Pathology**: Mutations in SLC1A3 have been associated with epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

**Function for gene**: SLC1A3 encodes a protein called excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which is a membrane-bound transporter responsible for regulating the extracellular concentrations of glutamate.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**:
- HGNC: 10970
- NCBI Entrez: 6507
- Ensembl: ENSG00000113522
- OMIM: 133550
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P43003

Aliases: Solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter), member 3; GLAST; EAAT1; SLC1A3.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
- c.832G>A (p.Arg278His) rs387906657
- c.1223C>A (p.Pro408His) rs387906656
- c.1373T>C (p.Ile458Thr) rs3937876

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in SLC1A3 have been associated with epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment options for disorders associated with SLC1A3 mutations vary depending on the specific disorder and severity. Prognosis is also dependent on the individual disorder and the impact of the genetic mutation.

**Drug Response**: Response to medication varies depending on the specific disorder and severity.
