# Information on Gene HBM

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Gene Name:** HBM
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11: 116,329,130-116,364,077
- **Pathology:** There is no known pathology associated with gene HBM.
- **Function:** Gene HBM, also known as HBM hemoglobin subunit mu, is involved in the regulation of oxygen transport in the body. It encodes for the alpha-globin chain of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which has a higher affinity to oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA).

## AA Mutation and dbSNP ID

There are several mutations associated with the HBM gene, including:

| AA Mutation  | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID     |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| His -> Arg (H73R) | Missense      | rs1061235 |
| Gly -> Glu (G74E) | Missense      | rs74932366|
| Ser -> Cys (S95C) | Missense      | rs33950507|
| IVS-II-745  | Splice site   | rs72554618|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID

There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels identified for HBM gene.

## Related Diseases

There are no known specific diseases associated with HBM gene mutations. However, certain hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia may involve HBM mutations in the context of fetal hemoglobin production.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no direct treatment available for HBM gene mutations since there are no known specific diseases associated with it. However, in some cases of hemoglobinopathies, HbF induction has been explored as a potential therapeutic option.

## Drug Response

There is no known drug response associated with HBM gene mutations.
