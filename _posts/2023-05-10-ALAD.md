## Gene: ALAD

### Function:
ALAD (Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of heme. It converts aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to porphobilinogen during the second step in the heme biosynthesis pathway.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:
- Gene ID: 210
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 9q34.2
- Aliases: ALADH

### External sites:
- HGNC: 396
- NCBI Entrez: 210
- Ensembl: ENSG00000136872
- OMIM: 125270
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13716

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg59Leu - missense variant - rs113994946
- p.Gly177Asp - missense variant - rs1800435
- p.Cys242Tyr - missense variant - rs121909790

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic variants have been reported for ALAD.

### Related disease:
Polymorphisms in the ALAD gene have been associated with susceptibility to lead toxicity. Studies have suggested that the p.Gly177Asp variant may increase the risk of lead poisoning in certain populations.

### Treatment and prognosis:
There is no definitive treatment for lead poisoning, but chelation therapy can help to remove lead from the body.

### Drug response:
There is no evidence to suggest that the ALAD gene is directly involved in drug response.
