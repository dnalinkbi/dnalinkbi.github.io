## Gene: LAMB3 

LAMB3 (Laminin subunit beta-3) is a protein-coding gene and is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q32.2). It encodes for a subunit of laminin-332 protein which is a part of the extracellular matrix and provides support to the basal lamina of epithelia. This protein is involved in the attachment and migration of cells, and plays a vital role in tissue generation, regeneration and remodeling.

### Function: 

LAMB3 is involved in skin, kidney and respiratory system development. Mutations in this gene may lead to junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a rare skin disorder.

### Related disease: 

Mutations in LAMB3 gene are associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). This disease is a rare genetic skin condition characterized by blistering of the skin and mucous membranes caused by mild mechanical trauma. Severity may range from mild to life-threatening.

### Treatment and prognosis: 

Currently, there is no known cure for JEB, only supportive care however, gene therapy and stem cell therapy are potential future treatments. The prognosis for individuals with JEB is variable, with some cases being more severe than others.

### Drug response:

Preclinical studies suggest that an antibody against LAMB3 can sensitize pancreatic tumours to chemotherapy. More information can be accessed through the [DrugBank]([Click](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11763))
