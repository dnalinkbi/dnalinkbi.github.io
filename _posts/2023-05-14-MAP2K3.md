## Gene: MAP2K3

### Genetic Position
MAP2K3 is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17q24.3.

### Pathology
MAP2K3 mutations have been associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.

### Function
MAP2K3 is a dual-specificity protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including the JNK and p38 pathways. It is involved in cellular responses to stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.
