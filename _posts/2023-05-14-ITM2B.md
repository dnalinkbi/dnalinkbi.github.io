## Information about gene ITM2B 

### Genetic Position:
The ITM2B gene is located on the chromosome 13q14.2.

### Pathology:
The ITM2B gene is associated with a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). 

### Function:
The ITM2B gene encodes Integral membrane protein 2B, which is involved in calcium homeostasis, calcium signaling, and protein trafficking.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.

### Related Disease:
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
No specific treatment or cure is available for CAA, but symptomatic treatment can help manage certain symptoms. Prognosis is generally poor as CAA can lead to progressive neurological decline.

### Drug Response:
There is no known drug response for CAA.
