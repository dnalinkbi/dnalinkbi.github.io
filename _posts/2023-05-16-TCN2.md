# Information about Gene TCN2

## Genetic Position
The TCN2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 at position q12.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TCN2 gene can cause a deficiency in vitamin B12, leading to pernicious anemia. This is because the TCN2 gene encodes the transcobalamin II protein which binds and transports vitamin B12 into cells.

## Function
The TCN2 gene encodes for a protein called transcobalamin II which is important in the transport of vitamin B12 into cells.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported mutations in the TCN2 gene associated with pernicious anemia. Some examples include:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|p.Arg98Trp|Missense|rs121909794|
|p.Glu27Lys|Missense|rs121909795|
|p.Ala59Thr|Missense|rs121909793|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the TCN2 gene listed in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
The TCN2 gene plays a key role in the development of pernicious anemia, a type of megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Patients with pernicious anemia are typically treated with injections of vitamin B12 or oral supplementation if the deficiency is less severe. Symptoms of anemia usually improve within a few days after initiating treatment. The prognosis is generally good with adequate treatment, but without treatment, pernicious anemia can lead to serious complications.

## Drug Response
Patients with pernicious anemia typically respond well to vitamin B12 supplementation.
