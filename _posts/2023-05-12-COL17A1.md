# Information about gene COL17A1

## Genetic Position
COL17A1 gene is located on chromosome 10 at the position 52307220 to 52430740 bp (GRCh38.p13).

## Pathology
Mutations in COL17A1 have been implicated in various pathologies such as Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), non-Herlitz type of JEB, pretibial pruritic papules, cicatricial pemphigoid, and melanoma.

## Function
COL17A1 encodes type XVII collagen, a protein that is a component of hemidesmosomes, which are anchoring structures found in the skin. Type XVII collagen contributes to the adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the underlying basement membrane.
