## Gene PACS1 Information

### Genetic Position
The PACS1 gene is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q13.1.

### Pathology
PACS1 gene mutations are associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech and language disorders, and brain abnormalities such as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.

### Function 
The PACS1 gene plays a role in regulating intracellular protein trafficking, specifically in the Golgi complex.
