# Information about Gene TTR

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 18
- NCBI Reference sequence: NC_000018.10
- Start position: 29,950,035 bp
- End position: 30,031,899 bp

## Pathology

The TTR gene is associated with Transthyretin-Related Amyloidosis (ATTR). ATTR is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects peripheral and autonomic nerves, the heart, and other organs. Mutations in the TTR gene lead to the formation of abnormal amyloid fibrils, which can accumulate in various tissues and cause organ dysfunction.

## Function for Gene

The TTR gene encodes for the transthyretin protein, which acts as a transporter of thyroxine and retinol-binding protein in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for ATTR, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment options include liver transplantation, TTR stabilizers (tafamidis and patisiran), NSAIDs, and pain management. The prognosis for ATTR depends on several factors, such as the specific mutation and early diagnosis and treatment.

## Drug Response

The drugs Tafamidis and Patisiran have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ATTR. Tafamidis is a TTR stabilizer that has been shown to slow the progression of the disease in patients with early-stage ATTR. Patisiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that targets the TTR gene and reduces the production of the protein.
