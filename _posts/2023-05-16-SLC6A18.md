# Gene Information Analysis: SLC6A18

## Genetic Position
SLC6A18 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at the location 3p25.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SLC6A18 gene are involved in the development of iminoglycinuria, which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased excretion of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline in the urine.

## Function for Gene
The SLC6A18 gene encodes for a transporter protein that plays a role in the uptake of amino acids, particularly glycine and proline, in the kidney and intestine.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 20419
- NCBI Entrez: 54723
- Ensembl: ENSG00000114600
- OMIM: 606763
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H015

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported for the SLC6A18 gene, which are associated with iminoglycinuria. Some of these are:
- p.Gly41Arg (rs144227385)
- p.Gly330Val (rs138715846)
- p.Phe365Leu (rs780766010)
- p.Thr424Met (rs121909306)

These mutations are missense mutations, meaning they involve the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic mutations reported for the SLC6A18 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SLC6A18 gene are associated with iminoglycinuria, which is a rare inherited disorder characterized by increased excretion of certain amino acids in the urine. The disorder is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for iminoglycinuria, but a low-protein diet may be recommended to reduce the excretion of amino acids in the urine. The prognosis for individuals with iminoglycinuria is generally good, as the disorder is usually non-progressive and does not cause significant health problems.

## Drug Response
There is no information available on drug response with respect to mutations in the SLC6A18 gene.
