## Information on Gene D2HGDH

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

Gene D2HGDH, also known as D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, is located on the chromosome 2 at the position 2q37.3. Mutations in this gene have been linked to the development of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. 

The D2HGDH gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of D-2-hydroxyglutarate to alpha-ketoglutarate. Alpha-ketoglutarate is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which is essential for energy production in cells. Therefore, mutations in the D2HGDH gene can lead to a buildup of D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which can cause toxic effects and damage to cells and tissues.

### Function for Gene

The D2HGDH gene's function is to encode the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme.

### External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases

The D2HGDH gene has several aliases and external IDs, which include:
- HGNC: 16231
- NCBI Entrez: 84668
- Ensembl: ENSG00000184706
- OMIM: 609186
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6NVY1

The genomic location of the D2HGDH gene is at chromosome 2q37.3.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

The D2HGDH gene mutations can cause a variety of changes in the amino acid sequence and protein structure, leading to the development of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Some of the commonly reported mutations in the D2HGDH gene and their dbSNP IDs include:
- c.725G>A (p.Arg242Gln) rs115469315
- c.518C>T (p.Arg173Ter) rs137852827
- c.650G>A (p.Arg217Gln) rs137852826

These mutations are mostly missense mutations, resulting in the change of one amino acid in the protein sequence, or nonsense mutations, which lead to the premature termination of protein synthesis.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

The somatic SNVs/InDels in the D2HGDH gene that have been reported in various cancers include:
- c.223C>T (p.Ala75Val) rs795295175
- c.682G>A (p.Gly228Ser) rs794726497

These mutations are not associated with 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria but are believed to contribute to the development of cancer through the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in cells.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the D2HGDH gene have been linked to the rare inherited metabolic disorder, 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. This disorder is characterized by the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in the body, leading to muscle weakness, seizures, neurologic deterioration, and delayed development.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no known cure for 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Treatment of the disorder is based on managing symptoms and preventing further complications. This includes a low-protein diet, physical therapy, and medications to manage seizures and other symptoms.

### Drug Response

Some studies have investigated the potential use of inhibitors of the D2HGDH enzyme as a targeted therapy for cancer. These inhibitors have shown promising results in preclinical studies and could be a potential treatment option for cancers with D2HGDH mutations.
