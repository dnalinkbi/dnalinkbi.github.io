# Information about Gene NDP

## Genetic Position
The gene NDP (Norrie disease protein) is located on the short (p) arm of the X chromosome at position Xp11.4.  

## Pathology and Function
The NDP gene provides instructions for the production of the Norrie disease protein. This protein plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the eyes, central nervous system, and vascular system. Mutations in this gene are associated with various ocular disorders, including Norrie disease, X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), and advanced retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic mutations have been reported for the NDP gene.

## Related Disease
- Norrie disease: a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the eyes and can lead to blindness.
- X-Linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR): a genetic eye disorder that can result in the abnormal development of blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision impairments or blindness.
- Advanced Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP): an eye disorder that primarily affects premature infants and can lead to vision loss.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Norrie disease, FEVR or ROP. Treatment options are limited and depend on the specific features and severity of the condition. Patients may need to undergo corrective eye surgery, laser treatments, or gene therapy. The prognosis for affected individuals can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically approved for the treatment of Norrie disease, FEVR, or ROP. However, there are ongoing clinical trials for gene therapy.
