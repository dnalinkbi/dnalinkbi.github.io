# Gene Information

## Gene Name and Synonyms

- Gene: ADCY10 (adenylate cyclase 10)
- Synonyms: AC10, KIAA1145

## Gene Function

ADCY10 encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) family of enzymes that catalyze the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. This gene is expressed in the brain, specifically in the regions involved in learning and memory, and may play a role in signal transduction pathways involved in these processes.

## Genetic Position and External IDs

- Chromosome: 1
- Start Position: 156,348,000 bp
- End Position: 156,744,000 bp
- Strand: Plus strand

### External IDs

- HGNC: 239
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 55806
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130723
- OMIM: 611173
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NFM4

## Variation Information

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- No AA mutations have been reported for ADCY10.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for ADCY10.

## Related Diseases

According to the OMIM database, mutations in ADCY10 have been associated with autosomal recessive mental retardation-45 (MRT45) characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disabilities, delayed psychomotor development, and other features such as seizures.

## Treatment and Prognosis

At present, there is no known cure for genetic disorders caused by ADCY10 gene mutations. Treatment for MRT45 is symptomatic and supportive, with a focus on optimizing the individualâ€™s intellectual and physical development.

## Drug Response

No specific drug therapies targeting ADCY10 gene mutations or MRT45 are currently available. However, there are ongoing studies investigating potential therapies for improving cognitive function in individuals affected by intellectual disabilities.
