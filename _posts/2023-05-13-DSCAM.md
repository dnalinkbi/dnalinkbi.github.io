# Information about Gene DSCAM

## General Information

- **Name**: Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM)
- **Location**: Chromosome 21q22.2
- **Aliases**: DSCAML1, DSCAM1, Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like 1 protein

## Function

The DSCAM gene encodes for a cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in neural development, specifically in axon guidance, neural wiring, and synapse formation. It is also involved in the immune response and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.

## External IDs

- **HGNC**: 3063
- **NCBI Entrez**: 1826
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000072955
- **OMIM**: 602523
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: O60469

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list**: Several missense mutations have been identified in the DSCAM gene.
- **Mutation type**: Missense mutation
- **dbSNP ID**: rs368899398

## Related Diseases

Disruptions in the DSCAM gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including Down syndrome, autism, and spastic paraplegia.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for genetic disorders caused by DSCAM mutations. Treatment options vary depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms. Prognosis also varies depending on factors such as age of onset and symptom severity.

## Drug Response

There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the DSCAM gene or its related disorders. However, research is ongoing in this area.
