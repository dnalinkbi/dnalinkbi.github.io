# Gene Information Analysis: CACNA1D 

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

**Gene** - CACNA1D
- The CACNA1D gene is located on chromosome 3 at position 25.1

**Function** - The CACNA1D gene encodes a subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Calcium channels play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression.

- OMIM: 114205
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01668
- Aliases: CACNL1A4, Cav1.3

- c.4319A>G, missense, rs137854129

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
- c.4414G>A, missense, rs757201763
- c.2114A>T, missense, rs747803038

**Related Disease**
- Primary aldosteronism with seizures and/or neurological deficits (PASNA)

**Treatment and Prognosis**
- Patients with PASNA may benefit from surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland.
- The long-term prognosis is variable and depends on the severity of the neurological deficits.

**Drug Response**
- Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, has been shown to effectively control blood pressure in patients with primary aldosteronism.
