# Information about FERMT1 gene 

## Genetic Position
- FERMT1 is located on chromosome 20 at position q11.2. 

## Pathology and Function
- FERMT1 encodes for the protein Fermitin family homolog 1, which is involved in the organization of cell-extracellular matrix interactions and regulation of cell adhesion. It plays a crucial role in integrin signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling. Mutations in FERMT1 have been linked to Kindler syndrome, an inherited skin disorder characterized by blistering, skin fragility, and abnormal skin pigmentation.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Locations
- External IDs: HGNC:3606, Entrez Gene: 10207, Ensembl: ENSG00000101211, OMIM: 607939, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BXU1 
- Aliases of FERMT1 gene: FERMT, KIND3, UNC-112 RELATED PROTEIN 3

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Several mutations have been identified in FERMT1 gene that cause Kindler syndrome, particularly missense mutations that change single amino acids in the protein.
- Some examples of missense mutations are:
  - c.1177C>T (p.Arg393Cys) with dbSNP ID rs968727975
  - c.1573G>A (p.Arg525Gln) with dbSNP ID rs104893950
  - c.2239G>A (p.Gly747Arg) with dbSNP ID rs368543355

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations in FERMT1 gene have been reported in various types of cancers such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer. However, such mutations are rare and their clinical significance is not fully understood.
- Some examples of somatic mutations are:
  - c.1331G>A (p.Trp444*) with dbSNP ID rs1555315117
  - c.242_245delAGGT with dbSNP ID rs1555460289

## Related Disease
- Kindler syndrome is the main disease associated with mutations in FERMT1 gene. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, abnormal skin pigmentation, and increased risk of skin cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no known cure for Kindler syndrome and treatment is focused on managing symptoms such as skin lesions and infections.
- The severity of the disease can vary widely among affected individuals and the prognosis is often difficult to predict.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information on drug response specific to Kindler syndrome or FERMT1 mutations. However, some therapies that have been used to treat other skin disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa may also be used for Kindler syndrome.
