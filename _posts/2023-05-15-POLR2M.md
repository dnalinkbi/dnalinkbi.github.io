# Information about gene POLR2M

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

**Genetic position:** POLR2M gene is located on chromosome 11 at position 11q13.1.

**Pathology:** There are currently no known disease associations for this gene.

**Function:** POLR2M encodes for a subunit of RNA polymerase II, a multi-subunit enzyme necessary for the transcription of protein-coding genes. POLR2M specifically interacts with Gdown1, a transcriptional regulatory protein that plays a key role in regulating RNA polymerase II transcription elongation.
