# Gene: PIK3R1

## Genetic Position
The PIK3R1 gene is located on chromosome 5q13.1.

## Pathology
The mutations in PIK3R1 are implicated in the development and progression of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and gastric cancer. Moreover, germline mutations in PIK3R1 have been identified in patients with primary immunodeficiencies.

## Function
PIK3R1 encodes p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, which regulates various cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and proliferation by inducing the phosphorylation of downstream effectors.

- c.1786G>A: Missense substitution (rs267607244)

## Related Disease
The mutations in PIK3R1 are associated with several types of cancer, including:
- Breast cancer 
- Ovarian Cancer
- Gastric cancer
- Colorectal cancer

## Treatments and Prognosis
The treatment options and prognosis may differ depending on the type of cancer and the specific mutation identified.

## Drug Response
Several studies have suggested that PI3K inhibitors may be effective in treating PIK3R1-mutated tumors, as they can block the downstream effectors induced by PI3K.
