# Information about Gene XIC

## Genetic Position
Gene XIC is located on Xq13.1, a region on the long arm of the X chromosome.

## Pathology
Mutations in Gene XIC have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.

## Function
Gene XIC plays a role in brain development and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure and regulates the expression of other genes on the X chromosome.
