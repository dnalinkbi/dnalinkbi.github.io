# Gene: PKP2

## Information on Gene

### Function
The PKP2 gene encodes for protein plakophilin-2, which is a member of the armadillo family and a component of the desmosome complex. The desmosome complex helps to maintain cell-to-cell adhesion in tissues that undergo mechanical stress such as heart muscle.

## Related Diseases
Variants of the PKP2 gene and mutations in the plakophilin-2 protein are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD), and other cardiac disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for most forms of cardiomyopathy, including those caused by variants in PKP2. Treatment options depend on the specific disease and symptoms but may include medications, implanted devices, or surgery.

## Drug Response
None reported.
