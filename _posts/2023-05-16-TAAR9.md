## Gene TAAR9

### Genetic Position

TAAR9, or trace amine associated receptor 9, is located on chromosome 6 at position 6q12. The gene spans approximately 6,677 base pairs on the negative strand.

### Pathology

TAAR9 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including depression and addiction. Studies have shown that TAAR9 plays a role in modulating the activity of dopamine in the brain.

### Function

TAAR9 is a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to trace amines, which are small organic compounds found in trace amounts in vertebrate tissues. The exact function of TAAR9 is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in modulating dopamine signaling in the brain.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

No known pathogenic mutations or SNPs have been reported for TAAR9.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for TAAR9.

### Related Disease

TAAR9 has been implicated in a number of diseases, including depression and addiction. Studies have shown that TAAR9 plays a role in modulating the activity of dopamine in the brain, which is associated with these disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Targeting TAAR9 may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for depression and addiction, although more research is needed to fully understand its role in these conditions.

### Drug Response

Studies have shown that TAAR9 is activated by a number of psychoactive compounds, including amphetamines and other stimulants. Targeting TAAR9 may offer a novel approach to drug development for these conditions.
