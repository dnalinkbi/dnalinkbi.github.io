## Information about Gene SLC5A5
SLC5A5 is a gene that encodes a sodium-iodide symporter protein. This protein functions as a membrane transport protein and is primarily expressed in the thyroid gland where it is responsible for the uptake of iodide ions for thyroid hormone synthesis. 

### Function for Gene
The primary function of the SLC5A5 gene is to encode a protein that transports iodide ions across the membrane in order to facilitate the production of thyroid hormones.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for thyroid hormone disorders related to SLC5A5 mutations may involve hormone replacement therapy. Prognosis depends on the specific disorder and severity of the condition.

### Drug Response
Some studies have shown that SLC5A5 mutations may be associated with changes in drug response to thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
