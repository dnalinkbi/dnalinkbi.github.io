# Gene FAN1

## Information
- Function: The FAN1 protein is part of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway and plays a critical role in repairing DNA crosslinks and double-strand breaks.
- External IDs: FAN1 gene is located on chromosome 15q13.3, and its aliases include KIAA1018, FLJ11773, and MGC133295.
- External sites: 
    - HGNC: 25559
    - NCBI Entrez: 80221
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000088832
    - OMIM: 614906
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NW38
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: There are numerous AA mutations reported for FAN1 gene, and a few examples of such AA mutations with dbSNP IDs are -
    - Missense mutation, p.Arg507Cys (rs786205769)
    - Missense mutation, p.Asn933Ser (rs1165900828)
    - Missense mutation, p.Thr130Asn (rs145692700)
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: There are many somatic SNVs/InDels reported for FAN1 gene in various cancers, and a few examples of such SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs are -
    - c.1606C>T, p.Arg536Cys (rs868337585)
    - c.1107+4A>C (rs766202477)
    - c.1944+2T>C (rs546574636)
- Related disease: Mutations in FAN1 gene are associated with different types of cancers, including breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment and prognosis of cancers associated with FAN1 mutation depend on the type of cancer and the severity of the mutation.
- Drug response: There are no known drugs or treatments that target FAN1 directly; however, the FA pathway is targeted by PARP inhibitors, which are currently being used in the clinical treatment of cancers with BRCA mutations in patients.
