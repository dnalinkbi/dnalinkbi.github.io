## Gene Information
**Gene Name:** CRYGC

**Function:** The CRYGC gene encodes a type of crystallin protein that constitutes a significant portion of the mammalian eye lens.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 2502 
- NCBI Entrez: 1409
- Ensembl: ENSG00000153261 
- OMIM: 123680
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07315

**Aliases:** CCG3, CRYG3, MGC111353

---
**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

No AA mutation is currently reported in dbSNP for CRYGC gene.

---
**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic SNVs/InDels are currently reported in dbSNP for CRYGC gene.

---
**Related Disease:**

The mutations in the CRYGC gene have been associated with congenital cataracts which are characterized by the clouding of the eye's natural lens. The affected individual's vision may be blurry or cloudy and may worsen over time.

---
**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Treatment of congenital cataracts involves removal of the cloudy lens and its replacement with an intraocular lens implant. Prognosis is usually positive with proper and timely diagnosis along with appropriate surgical interventions.

---
**Drug Response:**

No drug response information is currently available for CRYGC gene.
