# FLVCR1 Gene

## Gene Information
FLVCR1 stands for Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C Receptor 1. It is a gene that encodes a heme exporter protein. It is located on chromosome 1 at position 1q32.1 and spans about 11.33 kb of genomic DNA. The gene has 11 exons and 10 introns.

**Aliases:** ABC46, CYPLP2, MFSD7B, FLVCR, HHR8

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 2906
- NCBI Entrez: 23191
- Ensembl: ENSG00000185422
- OMIM: 609144
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5Y0

## Function
FLVCR1 encodes for a protein that belongs to the family of major facilitator proteins. It is involved in the export of heme from the cell and plays an important role in heme metabolism. The protein is expressed in various tissues including the liver, bone marrow, placenta, and retina.

## Mutations
FLVCR1 mutations have been associated with various inherited disorders, including:

- **Hereditary Porphyria:** FLVCR1 mutations cause porphyria in humans. The mutation p.I211T has been associated with this disease. 
    - dbSNP ID: rs61732508

- **Autosomal Recessive Hereditary Anemia:** Mutations in FLVCR1 cause a type of anemia known as autosomal recessive congenital sideroblastic anemia (ARCSA). One mutation in FLVCR1 that has been associated with this disease is c.155delA.
    - dbSNP ID: rs104894498

## Related Diseases
FLVCR1 mutations are associated with various inherited disorders, including:
- Porphyria
- Hereditary Anemia

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of FLVCR1-associated disorders may involve treatment for symptoms, such as administration of heme or red blood cell transfusions for anemia. With proper therapy, the prognosis for these conditions may improve.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug responses related to FLVCR1 mutations.
