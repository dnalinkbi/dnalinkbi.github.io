# Gene: APOA1

## Genomic Position:
APOA1 gene is located on the chromosome 11q23.3.

## Pathology:
Mutations in APOA1 gene affect the metabolism of apolipoprotein A, which plays a key role in cholesterol and lipid transport in the body. Mutations can lead to low levels of HDL cholesterol, which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## Function:
APOA1 protein is the primary component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also known as "good cholesterol". HDL transports excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for processing and excretion. APOA1 also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

- p.Arg218Cys (rs121912418)
- p.Gly26Ser (rs8178820)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no significant somatic mutations in APOA1 gene reported in the literature.

## Related disease:
- Familial LCAT deficiency
- Hypoalphalipoproteinemia
- Tangier's disease
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Atherosclerosis

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can improve HDL cholesterol levels.
- Medications such as niacin, fibrates, and statins can also increase HDL cholesterol levels.
- The prognosis varies depending on the severity and type of mutation.

## Drug Response:
- Niacin has been shown to increase HDL cholesterol levels by up to 30% in some patients.
- Fibrates, such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate, can also increase HDL cholesterol levels.
- Statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, can increase HDL cholesterol levels to a lesser extent than niacin or fibrates.
