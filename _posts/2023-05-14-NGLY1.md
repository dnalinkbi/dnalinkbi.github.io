# Information about Gene NGLY1

## Genetic Position
Gene NGLY1 is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p36.22.

## Function
Gene NGLY1 encodes an enzyme called Peptide-N(4)-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase which is involved in the protein quality control system of the cell. The enzyme helps to remove misfolded proteins by cleaving the N-linked glycan from the misfolded proteins before they are degraded.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
No single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that cause coding changes in the NGLY1 gene were found in the dbSNP database. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations in the NGLY1 gene were found in the dbSNP database.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the NGLY1 gene cause a rare genetic disorder called NGLY1 deficiency. This disorder is characterized by developmental delay, seizures, liver dysfunction, lack of tears, alacrima, and abnormal movement. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for NGLY1 deficiency, but supportive treatment can be provided to manage the symptoms. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can be helpful for the developmental delays. Prognosis is dependent on the symptoms and the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
Information about the drug response of NGLY1 deficiency is scarce.
