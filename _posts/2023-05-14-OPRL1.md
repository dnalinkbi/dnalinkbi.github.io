# Gene Information: OPRL1

## Genetic Position
The gene OPRL1 is located on chromosome 20q13.33.

## Pathology and Function
OPRL1 encodes the opioid receptor-like 1 protein, which is involved in pain modulation and behavioral effects mediated by opioids. It has been implicated in anxiety, depression, and drug abuse.

No known amino acid mutations for OPRL1 are currently listed in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No known somatic SNVs or InDels for OPRL1 are currently listed in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Variants in OPRL1 have been associated with increased risk for alcohol and drug dependence, as well as with anxiety and mood disorders. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for disorders related to OPRL1 variants varies and may include behavioral therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Prognosis depends on individual factors and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
OPRL1 is a promising target for novel analgesics, and specific agonists and antagonists for OPRL1 are being developed for clinical use.
