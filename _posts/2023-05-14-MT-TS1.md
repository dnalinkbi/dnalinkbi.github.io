# MT-TS1 Gene Information

### Genetic Position
The MT-TS1 gene is located on the mitochondrial genome at position 12,267.

### Pathology 
Mutations in the MT-TS1 gene are associated with mitochondrial diseases, particularly those affecting the nervous system, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).

### Function
MT-TS1 encodes for the transfer RNA (tRNA) responsible for transporting the amino acid serine during mitochondrial protein translation.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:7481
- NCBI Entrez ID: 4576
- Ensembl ID: ENSG0000021168
- OMIM ID: 590080
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P82912

Aliases: TRNS1, MTTN, MTTS, MTTS1, UURF9 

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the MT-TS1 gene associated with mitochondrial diseases such as LHON. Some examples of mutations are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m.7445A>G | Missense | rs28357986 |
| m.7456T>C | Missense | rs267606800 |
| m.7480A>G | Nonsense | rs121908092 |
| m.7481delA | Deletion | rs1553734389 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are various somatic mutations in the MT-TS1 gene, although many of them are not yet linked to any specific diseases. Some examples are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m.7451A>G | Missense | rs267606801 |
| m.7474A>G | Missense | rs267606802 |
| m.7468T>C | Missense | rs267606803 |

### Related Diseases
Mutations in the MT-TS1 gene are associated with mitochondrial diseases such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, and mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the MT-TS1 gene. Treatments are mostly supportive and may include physical therapy and medications to manage symptoms such as pain or seizures. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

### Drug Response
Research on potential drug treatments for mitochondrial diseases is ongoing, although there is currently no specific drug approved for use in MT-TS1-related diseases.
