# Gene PLEC

**Function:** The gene PLEC encodes for a protein called plectin, which is responsible for providing internal structure and stability to cells by anchoring intermediate filament cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane and organelles. It also plays a crucial role in muscular and skin integrity.

**External IDs and genomic location:**

- HGNC: 8973
- NCBI Entrez: 5339
- Ensembl: ENSG00000005893
- OMIM: 601282
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15149

The PLEC gene is located on chromosome 8 at the location 8q24.3.

**Aliases:** PCN, HD1, EBS4 

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

- c.7154A>C (p.Gln2385Pro) rs193960588
- c.8450C>T (p.Arg2817Cys) rs193302710
- c.8785A>G (p.Gln2929Arg) rs199469168
- c.10322C>T (p.Pro3441Ser) rs193302717 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- c.5321A>G (p.Ile1774Val) rs1554963195
- c.379G>T (p.Glu127Ter) rs1554962543
- c.8028C>T (p.Arg2676Ter) rs1554963871 

**Related disease:** Mutations in the PLEC gene have been associated with various diseases, including skin blistering disorders, muscular dystrophies, and neurological diseases, including epilepsy and migraines. 

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis options vary depending on the type and severity of the disease. Treatment may involve supportive therapy to manage symptoms such as pain, infections, skin complications, and respiratory problems. There is currently no cure for PLEC-related diseases. 

**Drug response:** Currently, there are no drugs specifically developed for treating PLEC-related diseases. However, in some cases, drugs like antiepileptic drugs and immunosuppressive agents may provide symptomatic relief.
