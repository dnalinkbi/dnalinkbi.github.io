# Gene: BRD4

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The BRD4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.1. This gene is associated with several types of cancer, including leukemia and solid tumors. The BRD4 gene encodes for a protein that interacts with chromatin, regulating gene expression and DNA replication. Specifically, BRD4 is known to bind to acetylated histones, allowing for increased transcriptional elongation.
