# Gene Information for BTBD9

## Genetic Position

- Chromosome location: 6p21.2
- Genomic coordinates: 32,344,895 - 32,364,109 bp
- Cytogenetic band: 6p21.2

## Pathology

The BTBD9 gene has been associated with various neurological disorders, including Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).

## Function

The BTBD9 gene encodes a protein that contains a BTB/POZ domain and a BACK domain. This protein is believed to play a role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and the assembly of protein complexes.

- c.810A>G (p.Asn270Ser) - rs937282

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic mutations in the BTBD9 gene.

## Related Disease

- Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
- Periodic Limb Movements in Sleep (PLMS)

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment for RLS and PLMS typically involves medications that target dopamine receptors in the brain. In some cases, iron supplements may also be recommended. The prognosis for these disorders varies depending on the severity and underlying cause of the symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is extensive evidence that BTBD9 polymorphisms are associated with differential drug responses to dopaminergic drugs used to treat RLS.
