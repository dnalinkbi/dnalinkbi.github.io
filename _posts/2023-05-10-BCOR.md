# Gene: BCOR

## Genetic Position
BCOR gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.4. The gene contains 15 exons and spans approximately 98.8 kb.

## Pathology and Function
BCOR (BCL6 corepressor) is a transcriptional corepressor that plays a critical role in gene regulation during development. It is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through chromatin modification. BCOR interacts with several proteins, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), to regulate gene expression. In addition, BCOR is known to be involved in human X-linked disorders, including Lenz Microphthalmia Syndrome (LMS) and Oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome.
