# Gene: ACHE

## Genetic Position
- Gene: ACHE (Acetylcholinesterase)
- Location: 7q22.1
- Chromosome: 7

## Pathology and Function
- Pathology: ACHE gene is associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 1C, slow-channel (CMS1C).
- Function: ACHE is a hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction.

## Related Disease
- Alzheimer's disease (AD)
- Myasthenic Syndrome, Congenital, 1C, Slow-Channel (CMS1C)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment options for AD and CMS1C are primarily focused on symptomatic relief. There is no cure for either condition.
- The prognosis for patients with AD or CMS1C varies depending on several factors including age, severity of symptoms, and response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- Several drugs are available to treat the symptoms of AD and CMS1C, including cholinesterase inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents. However, the response to these medications varies from patient to patient.
