## Gene: SLC25A46

### Genetic Position
SLC25A46 gene is located on chromosome 7q22.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in SLC25A46 gene are associated with Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 16 (PCH16), which is a rare autosomal-recessive brain disorder. 

### Function
SLC25A46 encodes for a mitochondrial solute carrier protein, a protein that is involved in the transport of metabolites across mitochondrial membranes.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for SLC25A46 gene.

### Related Disease
- Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 16 (PCH16)

### Treatment and Prognosis
No specific treatment is available for PCH16. The prognosis for PCH16 is poor, with affected individuals typically succumbing to the disease within the first two years of life.

### Drug Response
No drug response information is available for PCH16.
