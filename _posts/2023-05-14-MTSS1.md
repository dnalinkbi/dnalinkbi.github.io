# Information about Gene MTSS1

**Genetic position:** MTSS1 gene is located on the human chromosome 8q24.3. It spans about 19,912 base pairs of DNA and consists of 12 exons. 

**Pathology:** Alterations in the MTSS1 gene have been associated with various cancers, including breast, colon, liver, and lung cancer. Reduced expression of the MTSS1 gene has been observed in invasive cancer, suggesting that it may act as a tumor suppressor gene. 

**Function:** The MTSS1 gene encodes a protein called metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) also known as Missing in Metastasis (MIM). It plays a crucial role in regulating cell shape, motility, and adhesion. MTSS1 protein inhibits metastasis of cancer cells by regulating actin cytoskeleton and actin dynamics within the cells.

- rs137854728

**Related diseases:** MTSS1 gene mutations have been associated with breast cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer. Reduced expression of MTSS1 has also been linked to poor prognosis and survival in these cancers.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no specific treatment option available yet targeting MTSS1. However, restoring the expression of the MTSS1 protein in cancer cells may help to inhibit their metastatic potential and improve patient prognosis.

**Drug response:** There is currently no known drug specifically targeting MTSS1 protein.
