# Gene: MYCN
## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- MYCN gene is located on human chromosome 2p24.3-p23.3.
- It belongs to the MYC family of transcription factors, which are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
- MYCN plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system, especially during embryogenesis.
- Overexpression or amplification of MYCN is associated with a poor prognosis in certain types of cancer, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and small cell lung cancer.
- MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma is considered a high-risk factor and is often used as a marker for aggressive disease.
- MYCN is also involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, which can contribute to tumor growth and progression.

## Function for Gene
- MYCN plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system, especially during embryogenesis.
- It is involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression.
- MYCN also regulates angiogenesis and other biological processes that are important for tumor growth and progression.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- There are several missense mutations reported in MYCN gene with corresponding dbSNP IDs: rs121918981, rs267606843, and rs147559931.
- These mutations are associated with increased cancer risk, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and small cell lung cancer.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs and InDels reported in MYCN gene with corresponding dbSNP IDs: rs121918981, rs267606843, and rs147559931.
- These mutations are associated with increased cancer risk, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and small cell lung cancer.

## Related Disease
- MYCN amplification is associated with a poor prognosis in certain types of cancer, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and small cell lung cancer.
- MYCN gene mutations are also associated with increased cancer risk, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and small cell lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- MYCN amplification is considered a high-risk factor for neuroblastoma and is often used as a marker for aggressive disease.
- The treatment of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma usually involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
- The prognosis for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma is generally poor, especially in advanced cases.

## Drug Response
- MYCN expression has been shown to be a predictive marker for response to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin and etoposide.
- Several drugs targeting MYCN are currently being developed, including BET inhibitors and RNA interference.
