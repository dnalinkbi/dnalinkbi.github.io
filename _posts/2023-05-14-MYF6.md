# Information about gene MYF6

**Genetic position:** MYF6 is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p21.1).

**Pathology:** MYF6 mutations have been linked to various diseases, including a rare congenital muscular dystrophy known as Bethlem myopathy.

**Function:** MYF6 gene encodes the myogenic differentiation factor 1 (MyoD) protein, which plays a key role in muscle development. Specifically, MyoD is involved in the differentiation of myoblasts (precursor cells) into myocytes (muscle cells).

**External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 7579
- NCBI Entrez: 4617
- Ensembl: ENSG00000111676
- OMIM: 159991
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23409

Aliases: MYF4, Myf-6, bHLHc2

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

Currently, there are 24 known MYF6 mutations listed in the NCBI ClinVar database. None of these mutations have corresponding dbSNP IDs. 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are currently no somatic mutations in MYF6 listed in the dbSNP database.

**Related Disease:**

Mutations in MYF6 have been associated with the following muscular dystrophy disorders:

- Bethlem myopathy
- Myopathy, myofibrillar, 3 (MFM3)
- Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)

**Treatment and prognosis:**

Currently, there is no cure for Bethlem myopathy or other muscular dystrophies associated with MYF6 mutations. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the age of onset.

**Drug Response:**

There is limited information on drug response for Bethlem myopathy or other muscular dystrophies associated with MYF6 mutations.
