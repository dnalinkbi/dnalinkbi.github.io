# Gene: RNF43

## Genetic Position
RNF43 is located on chromosome 17q21.31.

## Pathology
RNF43 gene is associated with various types of cancer. RNF43 mutations are found in many types of tumors, particularly in colorectal cancer.

## Function
The RNF43 gene encodes a protein called E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF43. This protein is involved in the negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a pathway that is dysregulated in various types of cancer. It plays a crucial role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for RNF43 mutations, but targeted therapies have been developed for inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the prognosis of patients with RNF43 mutated tumors is poor, as these tumors are often resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that RNF43 mutated tumors are sensitive to Porcupine inhibitors, a class of drugs that inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
