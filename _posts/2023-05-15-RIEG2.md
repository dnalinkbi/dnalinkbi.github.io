## **Information about Gene RIEG2**

### **Genetic Position**

RIEG2 (also known as PITX2) is a gene located on chromosome 4q25. 

### **Pathology**

Mutations in RIEG2 have been associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal development of the eyes, teeth, and facial structures. 

### **Function for Gene**

RIEG2 encodes a transcription factor that is involved in the development of many organs and tissue types, including the eyes, teeth, and heart. 

### **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases**

- Alias: ARP1, ASGD7, IHG2, IGDS, IRID1, Otlx2, RGS 

### **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**

Some of the amino acid (AA) mutations in RIEG2 associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome with their mutation type and dbSNP IDs are as follows: 

- E64K (Missense; dbSNP:rs1800401) 
- M23K (Missense; dbSNP:rs121909470) 
- G19R (Missense; dbSNP:rs188066651)
- R16Q (Missense; dbSNP:rs121909469)

### **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for RIEG2.

### **Related Disease**

Mutations in RIEG2 have been primarily associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eye, teeth, and facial structures.

### **Treatment and Prognosis**

Currently, there is no cure for Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, and treatment is usually focused on managing the symptoms caused by the condition. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the symptoms.

### **Drug Response**

There is no available information on the drug response of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome that is associated with RIEG2 mutation.
