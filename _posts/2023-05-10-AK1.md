## Gene AK1 

### Genomic Position
Gene AK1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q34.2). This gene spans 44,778 base pairs and consists of nine exons.

### Pathology and Function
AK1 encodes for an adenylate kinase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to AMP, producing ADP and maintaining the energy balance in cell. This enzyme plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle energy metabolism and erythrocyte disorders. Mutations in AK1 gene may result in hemolytic anemia or myopathy due to the inability to maintain the required ATP pool.

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations in AK1 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in AK1 gene are associated with the following diseases:
- Hemolytic anemia due to red cell adenylate kinase deficiency (OMIM: 612631)
- Muscular dystrophy, congenital, due to AK1 deficiency (OMIM: 612635)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for AK1 deficiencies, but treatment is done to manage the symptoms of the disease. For hemolytic anemia, blood transfusions are administered, while patients with AK1 myopathy are advised to make lifestyle changes and exercise regularly to prevent muscle weakness. Early detection through genetic testing can help in the management and prognosis of AK1 gene-related disorders.

### Drug Response
There are no known drug responses specific to AK1 deficiencies.
