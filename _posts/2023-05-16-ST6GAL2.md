# Gene: ST6GAL2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 3
- Location: 3q27.1

## Pathology
The ST6GAL2 gene has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurological diseases.

## Function
The ST6GAL2 gene encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that adds sialic acid residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This modification plays an important role in cell adhesion and signaling.
