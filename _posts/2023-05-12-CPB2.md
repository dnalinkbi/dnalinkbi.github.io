# Genetic Information of Gene CPB2

## Gene Information
- **Gene name:** Carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2)
- **Function for gene:** The protein encoded by CPB2 gene is a carboxypeptidase that cleaves C-terminal amino acid residues of proteins and peptides. This gene is expressed in gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and liver.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
    - **Genomic location:** Chromosome 13q14.11
    - **Aliases:** TAFI, procarboxypeptidase B, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor

## Sequence Information
- **Protein ID:** NP_001316.2
- **Coding DNA (cDNA) sequence:** NM_001325.4
- **Amino acid (AA) sequence:** NP_001316.2

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
    - p.Arg73His (R73H) - rs121913601
    - p.Arg566Trp (R566W) - rs121913602
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported yet.

## Related Diseases
- The CPB2 gene has been linked with the following diseases:
    - Thrombophilia due to thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor deficiency
    - Deep Venous Thrombosis
    - Hemorrhage
    - Pulmonary Embolism

## Treatment and Prognosis
