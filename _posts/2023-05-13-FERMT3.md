# Gene Information: FERMT3

## Genetic Position

FERMT3 gene is located on human chromosome 11q13.1. It spans about 47.37 kb and consists of 18 exons.

## Pathology and Function

The FERMT3 gene encodes Fermitin family member 3 protein. It is involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It interacts with integrins, which are transmembrane receptors that mediate adhesion between cells and the extracellular matrix.

Mutations in FERMT3 have been linked to Kindler syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer.
