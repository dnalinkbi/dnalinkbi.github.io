# Gene MCOLN1

## Genetic Position
The MCOLN1 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.2-p13.12.

## Pathology
Mutations in MCOLN1 are associated with mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe neurodevelopmental delay, progressive visual impairment, and achlorhydria.

## Function
MCOLN1 encodes a protein called mucolipin-1 (TRPML1), which functions as a cation channel within the lysosome. TRPML1 is involved in lysosomal calcium homeostasis, membrane trafficking, and autophagy.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported for MCOLN1 in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
MCOLN1 mutations are associated with mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). MLIV is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe neurodevelopmental delay, progressive visual impairment, and achlorhydria.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for MLIV and treatment is mainly supportive, focusing on managing symptoms as they arise. Prognosis for MLIV is poor, with affected individuals having a shortened lifespan and severely impaired quality of life.

## Drug Response
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of MLIV. However, several small molecule compounds have been identified that can restore lysosomal function in MCOLN1-deficient cells, providing promise for future therapeutic interventions.
