# Gene: SLC22A18

## Information

### Genetic position

- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11q13.1

### Pathology

SLC22A18 gene has been associated with several diseases such as prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. The expression levels of SLC22A18 have been found to be significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues.

### Function

SLC22A18 encodes for the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) protein, which is involved in the transport of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds across cell membranes. The OCT2 protein is primarily expressed in the kidney and plays a crucial role in drug elimination.

### External IDs

- NCBI Entrez: 116085
- Ensembl: ENSG00000167613
- OMIM: 611016
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H015

### Aliases

- OCT2
- SLC22A18A
- SLC22A18P1

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several variations in the SLC22A18 gene associated with human cancers. The most common ones include:

| Mutation AA | Mutation Type   | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| V400M       | Missense        | rs17852153 |
| L461F       | Missense        | rs150476904 |
| A270S       | Missense        | rs45400304 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic variations reported in the SLC22A18 gene in different cancer types. The most common somatic variations include:

- c.571G>A, p.R191Q, rs41274796
- c.1184A>G, p.Y395C, rs34376716

### Related Disease

SLC22A18 gene has been linked with several diseases, including:

- Prostate cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Neuroblastoma

### Treatment and prognosis

The role of SLC22A18 in drug elimination and its association with several cancers make this gene an attractive target for cancer therapies. Further research is needed to explore the potential therapeutic benefits of modulating the expression of SLC22A18.

### Drug response

SLC22A18 gene regulates the uptake and elimination of a wide range of drugs, including metformin, cimetidine, and imatinib. Variations in the SLC22A18 gene have been associated with altered drug efficacy and drug-induced toxicity.
