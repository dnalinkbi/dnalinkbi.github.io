# Information about gene TREM2
## Genetic position, pathology and function

**Gene:** TREM2

**Function for gene:** The TREM2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2. This protein is located on the surface of immune cells called macrophages and microglia, which are involved in the immune response and inflammation. The protein is thought to play a role in the regulation of inflammation, the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and the response to pathogens in the brain.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

- Genomic location: Chromosome 6p21.1
- Gene ID: 54209
- HGNC ID: 17727
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000183049
- OMIM ID: 605086
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NZC2
- Aliases: TREM-2; Trem2a; Trem2b

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several mutations in the TREM2 gene associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. These include:

- R47H: rs75932628
- R62H: rs2234253
- D87N: rs143332484
- Y38C: rs200704245
- T96K: rs142232675
- Q33X: rs3732378

These mutations can result in changes to the structure or function of the TREM2 protein, which may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are currently no known somatic mutations in the TREM2 gene.

**Related disease:**

Mutations in the TREM2 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These mutations may contribute to the development and progression of these diseases by affecting the immune response and inflammation in the brain.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative diseases associated with TREM2 mutations. However, there are treatments that can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These include medications to improve memory and cognitive function, as well as therapies to address behavioral and psychiatric symptoms.

**Drug response:**

There is currently no specific drug treatment for TREM2-related diseases. However, ongoing research is focused on developing drugs that target the immune response and inflammation in the brain.
