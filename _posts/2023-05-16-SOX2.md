# Analysis of the Gene SOX2

## Gene Information
The SOX2 gene is located on chromosome 3 at position 3q26.33 and spans 34,335 nucleotides. Its official gene symbol is SOX2, and it is also known as ANOP3, MCOPS3, and SRY-box transcription factor 2. The gene has 6 exons and codes for a protein of 317 amino acids.

## Function
The SOX2 gene is a transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of embryonic development, specifically in the formation of the nervous system and the eyes. It has also been found to be involved in the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency.
