# Gene: PICALM 

- **Function:** PICALM (Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein) is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles during endocytosis, which is critical for the regulation of neurotransmitters and lipid metabolism. Additionally, it has been reported to play a role in the regulation of protein degradation and trafficking.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - rs3851179 - p.Ser303Asn (missense)
    - rs10792832 - p.Ser385Asn (missense)
    - rs10934490 - p.Val484Ile (missense)
    - rs112657409 - p.Ser647Phe (missense)
    - rs112916650 - p.Gly670Ser (missense)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - Not found.

- **Related disease:** 
    - PICALM has been implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), endometrial cancer, and schizophrenia. Additionally, PICALM has been reported to be associated with the regulation of lipid metabolism, which could potentially impact the onset of other metabolic diseases.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**
    - Currently, there is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease nor is there a specific treatment for PICALM-associated pathologies. However, research is ongoing to develop therapies that can modulate PICALM activity and restore its biological function.

- **Drug response:**
    - No specific drug response has been reported for PICALM.
