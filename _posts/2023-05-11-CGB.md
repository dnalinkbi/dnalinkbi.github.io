# Gene CGB Information

## General Information
- The gene CGB is located at chromosome 5q13.1 and has a genomic size of around 2kb.

## Function
- CGB encodes the beta chain of chorionic gonadotropin (CG), a hormone mainly produced by the placenta during pregnancy.
- CG plays a crucial role in maintaining pregnancy by stimulating the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone.
- Additionally, CG is used as a marker in pregnancy tests and in monitoring certain cancers, such as testicular and ovarian cancer.
