## **Information about Gene GALC** 

### Gene Position
The GALC gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at the position 14q31.3. It spans 57,871 bases and has 17 exons.

### Pathology and Function
GALC, which stands for galactosylceramidase, encodes an enzyme that is responsible for breaking down galactolipids, including galactocerebroside and psychosine, in myelin sheaths of nerve cells in the brain. Mutations in the GALC gene cause a rare genetic disorder called Krabbe disease or globoid cell leukodystrophy. This condition leads to destruction of the myelin sheath of nerves and causes severe neurological symptoms such as developmental delay, seizures, muscle weakness, and vision loss.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Mutations in the GALC gene can result in a variety of amino acid changes, which can lead to Krabbe disease. Some of these mutations are:

|Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|-------------|--------|
|p.Ile104Thr|Missense|rs104894066|
|p.Ile173Ser|Missense|rs104894065|
|p.Ile276Thr|Missense|rs131838134|
|p.Arg293Cys|Missense|rs28939089|
|p.Gln385Ter|Nonsense|rs1378530732|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the GALC gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the GALC gene can cause Krabbe disease, a rare disorder that affects the nervous system. Symptoms of the disease usually begin in early infancy and progress rapidly, leading to severe disability and often death by the age of 2.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Krabbe disease. Treatments are mainly supportive and focus on relieving the symptoms. Some treatments may include physical therapy, anticonvulsants, and medication to manage muscle stiffness and spasms. Prognosis for individuals with Krabbe disease is generally poor, with most individuals dying within the first few years of life.

### Drug Response
There are no known drugs that can effectively cure Krabbe disease, but some treatments may provide temporary relief of symptoms.
