# Gene Information: DSG2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

**Genetic Position:** DSG2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 at position 12.1 (18q12.1).

**Pathology:** Mutations in DSG2 have been associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium. This leads to arrhythmias and eventually heart failure.

**Function:** DSG2 encodes desmoglein-2, which is a calcium-binding transmembrane glycoprotein that is primarily expressed in the heart, skin, and hair follicles. Desmoglein-2 plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in cardiac desmosomes, which are intercellular junctions between cardiomyocytes. It is responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the heart by facilitating the attachment of adjacent cardiomyocytes.

## Additional Information

**Function for gene:** Desmoglein-2 is involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in cardiac desmosomes.

**Related disease:** Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for ARVD typically involves the use of antiarrhythmic medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. There is no cure for ARVD, and prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and response to treatment.

**Drug response:** There is evidence to suggest that certain drugs, such as beta-blockers and mexiletine, may be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of arrhythmias in patients with ARVD.
