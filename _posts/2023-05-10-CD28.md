# Information about Gene CD28

## Genetic Position
The gene CD28 is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q33.2.

## Pathology and Function
CD28 is a protein-coding gene that plays a crucial role in the immune system. It encodes a T-cell surface antigen that enhances immune responses. CD28 acts as a co-stimulatory molecule, which means that it works in conjunction with the T-cell receptor to activate and proliferate T-cells. Dysfunction or mutations in CD28 gene could cause an imbalance in immune response and lead to altered immune function.

## Gene Function
- CD28 acts as a co-stimulatory molecule in T cell activation.
- It is involved in the regulation of T cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.
- It increases cytokine production and enhances effector function.
- CD28 is known for its role in T cell activation and the development and progression of various autoimmune diseases

## Related Diseases
Dysfunction or mutations in CD28 have been linked to various autoimmune diseases, including:

- Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Type 1 Diabetes
- Sjögren’s Syndrome
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for CD28-related diseases. Treatment options for these conditions usually depend on the severity and specific symptoms. Some treatments may include immunosuppressive drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and biological therapies. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and individual circumstances.
