## Gene: MST1R

### Position
MST1R gene is located on chromosome 3q26.2 and spans 94.8 kb of genomic DNA.

### Pathology
MST1R gene is associated with several cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer. Increased expression of MST1R has been observed in multiple tumor types, and it is considered to play a key role in tumor metastasis.

### Function
MST1R, also known as RON (Recepteur d'Origine Nantais), is a member of the c-MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases. It is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and motility. MST1R signaling pathway is activated by macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), resulting in the activation of downstream signaling cascades, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB).

### Related diseases
MST1R has been linked to several diseases including:
- Cancer
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Diabetes
- Atherosclerosis

### Treatment and prognosis
MST1R inhibitors are being developed as potential cancer therapies. Preclinical studies have shown promising results in reducing tumor growth and metastasis. However, further research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these inhibitors in humans.

### Drug response
Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of several MST1R inhibitors, including TP-0903, LY2801653, and GSK3389404. Preliminary results have shown promising antitumor activity of these inhibitors in advanced solid tumors.
