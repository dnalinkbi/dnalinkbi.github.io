# Information about Gene IRAK3

## Gene Information 
- **Function:** The gene IRAK3 encodes interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-3, which is involved in the immune system response.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 6071 
    - NCBI Entrez: 11213 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000116861 
    - OMIM: 603446 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y616
- **Aliases:** IRAK-M, IRHM

## Genetic Position
- **Chromosome:** 12
- **Genomic Location:** 81,093,044 to 81,137,578 bp

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID 
- There are several non-synonymous variants (missense mutations) reported in dbSNP for the IRAK3 gene, including: 
    - rs576195887 (p.Gly271Arg)
    - rs200397819 (p.Gly21Ser)
    - rs199881418 (p.Ile184Val)
    - rs200577351 (p.Arg374Cys)
- These mutations are classified as "benign" or "likely benign" by dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no known somatic mutations reported for IRAK3 in dbSNP.

## Pathology
- Research has shown that IRAK3 plays a role in regulating inflammation and preventing excessive activation of the immune system. 
- Dysregulation of IRAK3 has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer. 
- Some studies have suggested that IRAK3 mutations or decreased expression levels may contribute to the development of these conditions.

## Related Disease 
- Autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer are some of the related diseases linked with IRAK3.

## Treatment and Prognosis 
- No approved treatments are specifically targeting IRAK3; however, some drugs targeting inflammation and immune system dysfunction are being investigated in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases and cancer. 
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and individual case.

## Drug Response 
- There is limited research on drug response related to IRAK3.
