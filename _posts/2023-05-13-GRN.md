# Information about gene GRN

## Genetic Position
GRN gene is located on Chromosome 17 at the position 17q21.31.

## Pathology
Mutations or abnormalities in the GRN gene may lead to frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a group of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These mutations lead to a deficiency in progranulin, the protein encoded by the GRN gene, which is involved in cell growth and repair, inflammation, and the maintenance of neurons.

## Function
The GRN gene encodes the progranulin protein, which is involved in various processes such as wound healing, immune response regulation, and neuron survival.

## Related Disease
Abnormalities in the GRN gene are associated with familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other related neurodegenerative disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure or specific treatment for frontotemporal dementia. However, some drugs and therapies may be used to manage symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is no information available regarding specific drug responses for GRN gene mutations.
