## Information about gene NT5C1B

### Genetic position
NT5C1B is located on the chromosome 10q24.1.

### Pathology
A missense mutation in NT5C1B is involved in genetically inherited neuropathy and it results in a lack of ADP-ribose, leading to a reduced level of mitochondrial functions.

### Function
NT5C1B encodes a 5'-nucleotidase responsible for the hydrolysis of nucleotides including ADP-ribose, ADP, and AMP into their corresponding nucleosides. Additionally, NT5C1B is involved in purine salvage and RNA metabolism.
