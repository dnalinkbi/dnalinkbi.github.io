# Information about gene NFATC3

## Genetic Position
The gene NFATC3, also known as nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 3, is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at position 16q22.1.

## Pathology and Function
NFATC3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a vital role in the immune system. It regulates the expression of several cytokines, such as interleukin-2 and gamma interferon, that are crucial for the activation and proliferation of T-cells. Besides, NFATC3 plays important roles in skeletal and cardiac muscle development, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations in this gene can cause immune dysfunction or lead to musculoskeletal pathologies.

- rs796152728
- rs797044955
- rs796478893
- rs797654286

## Related Disease
Mutations in the NFATC3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Primary immunodeficiency
- Osteoarthritis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Myositis
- Cardiomyopathy
- Breast cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of NFATC3-related diseases are based on the specific pathology and can vary widely. Some of the treatment options include immunosuppressive drugs, glucocorticoids, or anti-inflammatory agents.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to NFATC3 mutations. However, some studies suggest that modulating NFAT signaling pathways could improve cancer treatment outcomes.
