## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the SERPINA7 gene so far.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SERPINA7 gene are not known to directly cause any diseases, however, low levels of TBG in the blood can cause altered thyroid function.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for SERPINA7 mutations as its variants are generally considered benign. However, individuals with low levels of TBG may require hormone replacement therapy.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to SERPINA7 mutations.
