# Gene: PAX7

## Information

- **Function:** The PAX7 gene encodes for the transcription factor PAX7, which is involved in muscle development and satellite cell regulation in adults.

- **External IDs:**
    - Gene ID: 5082
    - Genomic location: chromosome 1 (1p36.13)
    - Aliases: HUP1, PAX3, MRD2, DSS

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.A330G (p.H110R) - rs56114864
    - c.T506C (p.L169P) - rs137853636
    - c.G803A (p.R268H) - rs137853637

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID.

- **Related disease:** The PAX7 gene has been associated with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops from skeletal muscle cells.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for this cancer depends on various factors, including the location and stage of the cancer, patient age, and response to treatment.

- **Drug response:** N/A.
