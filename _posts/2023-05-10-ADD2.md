# Gene Information for ADD2

**Genetic Position:** The gene ADD2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2p13.3. 

**Pathology:** Genetic variants in ADD2 have been associated with various pathologies, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and susceptibility to albuminuria.

**Function:** The ADD2 gene encodes for the protein adducin-Î², which is involved in the regulation of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton of erythrocytes, platelets, and the renal tubular epithelial cells. 

**External IDs and Aliases:**

- HGNC ID: 240
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 119
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000125266
- OMIM ID: 102680
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P35611
- Other Aliases: ADD, ADDB, ADDL, HSDBTA 

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** 

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADD2 that are associated with different diseases. Here are a few examples: 

- c.1792A>G (p.Thr598Ala) - rs4984 - associated with hypertension 
- c.376C>T (p.Ala126Val) - rs11950646 - associated with chronic kidney disease

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are various somatic mutations reported in ADD2 protein in different types of cancer. Here are a few examples: 

- c.793C>A (p.His265Asn) - rs367543259 - reported in breast cancer
- c.2207G>A (p.Val736Ile) - rs768528562 - reported in cervical cancer

**Related Disease:** As mentioned above, genetic variants in ADD2 have been associated with several diseases, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and susceptibility to albuminuria.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis are dependent on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms. Some treatments for hypertension, such as calcium channel blockers, have been reported to be effective in patients with certain genetic variants in ADD2.

**Drug Response:** Some studies have found that individuals with specific genetic variants in ADD2 may respond differently to certain medications, such as diuretics or beta-blockers.
