# Genetic Information of Gene H3F3A

## Gene Information

- Function: The H3F3A gene encodes a histone protein that is incorporated into nucleosomes of chromatin and contributes to chromatin structure and gene regulation.
- External IDs: 
    - Gene ID: 3020
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 1, 226,962,679-226,964,463
    - Aliases: H3.3A, H3/A, H3F3, H3 histone family member 3A

## Variants Information

- AA Mutation List:
    - p.K27M
    - p.G34R/V
    - p.A89V
- Mutation Type: Substitution
- dbSNP IDs:
    - rs768951653
    - rs1248789852
    - rs150187950

- Somatic SNVs/InDels:
    - single-nucleotide variant
    - indel
- dbSNP IDs: 
    - rs1131659617
    - rs1124919432
    - rs1182153472 

## Related Disease

- H3F3A mutations are associated with certain brain tumors, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and midline gliomas. 
- H3F3A mutations have also been identified in chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone, and osteosarcoma.
- The mutations in H3F3A decrease methylation at Lys4 and increase methylation at Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27M), which alters the expression of genes involved in cell division, gene expression regulation, and DNA repair.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, treatment options for H3F3A-associated tumors are limited. Radiation and chemotherapy do not appear to be effective, and surgery is often difficult because of the deep location and the highly infiltrative nature of these tumors. 
- Prognosis is poor, with median survival only about one year after diagnosis. 

## Drug Response

- Some preclinical studies have suggested potential therapeutic targets, such as BET inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors, but further research is needed in this area.
