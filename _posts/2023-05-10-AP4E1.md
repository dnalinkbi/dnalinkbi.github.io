# Information about gene AP4E1 

## Genetic position
The AP4E1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.2 (15q21.2).

## Pathology and function
The AP4E1 gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex AP-4. The AP-4 complex is involved in intracellular trafficking of proteins and is particularly important for the sorting of membrane proteins to synaptic vesicles. Mutations in the AP4E1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including spastic paraplegia type 51 (SPG51) and cerebral palsy.
