# Information about Gene ABCC3

## Genetic Position

The ABCC3 gene is located on chromosome 17 at the locus 17q21.33.

## Pathology and Function

The ABCC3 gene, also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 3, encodes a protein that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters. This transporter protein is involved in the cellular efflux of various endogenous and xenobiotic compounds from cells, including drugs, toxins, and metabolites. 

## External IDs and Genomic Location

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several missense mutations reported in the ABCC3 gene with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- c.2804T>C (p.Phe935Leu), rs3742106
- c.3541G>A (p.Gly1181Arg), rs4149185
- c.3598T>C (p.Ile1200Thr), rs4149186
- c.3584A>G (p.Ile1195Val), rs4149184

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) reported in the ABCC3 gene with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- c.3037-7T>C, rs775365667
- c.1324+17C>T, rs1560180
- c.774+41T>C, rs80275784

## Related Disease

Alterations in the ABCC3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Cholestasis
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Acute myeloid leukemia

## Treatment and Prognosis

Pharmacological modulation of ABCC3 expression and function may be a potential strategy to improve drug efficacy or overcome drug resistance. However, more research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of ABCC3 alterations.

## Drug Response

ABCC3 plays a role in the cellular efflux of various drugs, and alterations in the gene may affect drug response. For example, high ABCC3 expression has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in cancer cells.
