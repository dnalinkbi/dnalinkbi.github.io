## Gene: XRCC4

### Genetic Position:
XRCC4 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p13.1).

### Pathology:
XRCC4 gene is associated with DNA repair and recombination. Mutations in this gene can cause genetic instability that increases the risk of cancer development.

### Function:
The XRCC4 protein plays a role in DNA double-strand break repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. It is essential for the proper alignment and joining of the DNA ends.
