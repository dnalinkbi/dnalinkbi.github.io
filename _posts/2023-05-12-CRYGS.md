# Gene CRYGS

## Genetic Position
The gene CRYGS is located on chromosome 3q22.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CRYGS gene have been associated with a congenital nuclear cataract, which is a clouding of the eye's natural lens that is present at birth.

## Function
The CRYGS gene encodes a member of the group of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) that has a chaperone-like function and plays a role in maintaining the transparency of the eye lens.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- R12C (rs11554275)
- R12H (rs143071795)
- R12S (rs141617760)
- R21W (rs104894151)
- R54C (rs104894152)
- R54L (rs104894153)
- S100R (rs398123065)

All of the above mutations are missense mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the CRYGS gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CRYGS gene have been associated with congenital nuclear cataract, which can result in decreased visual acuity.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for congenital cataract is typically surgical removal of the lens followed by corrective lenses or intraocular lens implantation. The prognosis for individuals with CRYGS-related congenital cataract is generally good with appropriate treatment.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeted to treat CRYGS-related congenital cataract.
