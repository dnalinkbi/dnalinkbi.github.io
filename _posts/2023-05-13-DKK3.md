# Information about gene DKK3

## Genetic Position

- DKK3 gene is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11p15.3.

## Pathology

- The DKK3 gene is implicated in various cancer types such as lung cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc. Studies have suggested that its expression is associated with tumor suppression and plays a role in inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Function of Gene

- DKK3 gene encodes for a protein called the Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) which is a member of the DKK protein family. It is involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## External IDs

- Gene ID: 27122
- Genomic Location: 11p15.3
- Aliases: REIC, RIG, Reduced expression in immortalized cells protein, Dickkopf-related protein 3, RZF

## Related Disease

- The DKK3 gene is implicated in various types of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Studies have suggested that the DKK3 gene could be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment as it plays a role in inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway which is involved in tumor progression. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its therapeutic potential.

## Drug Response

- There is no information available on drug response related to the DKK3 gene.
