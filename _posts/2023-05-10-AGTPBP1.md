## Gene AGTPBP1

### Genetic Position
AGTPBP1 (ATP/GTP binding protein 1) is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 3q25.31.

### Pathology and Function
AGTPBP1 encodes a protein that is involved in ATP and GTP binding and hydrolysis. The exact function of the protein is not well understood, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene expression, cell signaling, and endocytosis.
