# Gene CD24 

## Genetic Position 

The gene CD24 is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q21.33.

## Pathology 

Studies have shown that CD24 is involved in multiple types of cancers, including breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. It is believed to play a role in tumor development and progression, as well as in cancer invasion and migration. 

## Function 

The gene CD24 encodes a protein that is a cell surface glycoprotein. It is involved in cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions, as well as in cell signaling cascades. It has also been shown to be involved in tumor suppression and immune response regulation.
