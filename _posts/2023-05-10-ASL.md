# Gene ASL

### Basic Information:
- Gene name: ASL (Argininosuccinate lyase)
- Genomic location: Chromosome 7 (7q11.21)
- Aliases: Argininosuccinase, ASAL, CRL, L-ASL

### Function:
The ASL gene provides instructions to make an enzyme called argininosuccinate lyase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body by converting it to urea. The ASL enzyme helps convert argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate, allowing for the elimination of excess nitrogen.

### External IDs and sites:
- HGNC: 757
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 435
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106325
- OMIM: 608310

### Related diseases:
- ASL deficiency: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle. It is caused by mutations in the ASL gene and can lead to hyperammonemia, seizures, developmental delays, and other health problems.

### Treatment and prognosis:
- Treatment for ASL deficiency typically involves a combination of dietary restrictions and medications to manage ammonia levels in the body. In some cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.
- The prognosis for ASL deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition and whether it is diagnosed early and managed appropriately.

### Drug response:
- There are currently no drugs specifically approved to treat ASL deficiency, but some medications may be used off-label to help manage symptoms.
