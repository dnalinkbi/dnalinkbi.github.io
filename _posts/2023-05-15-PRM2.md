## Gene PRM2

### Genetic Position

The gene PRM2 is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.2.

### Pathology

Mutations in PRM2 have been linked to male infertility. Specifically, variants in this gene can lead to the abnormal development of sperm cells and infertility. 

### Function

The PRM2 gene encodes protamine 2, a protein that plays a key role in sperm chromatin organization and compaction during spermatogenesis.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are various missense and nonsense mutations reported in the PRM2 gene. Here are some examples:

- p.Phe8SerfsTer12 (frameshift)
- p.Arg18His (missense)
- p.Gln46Ter (nonsense)
- dbSNP IDs: rs267607135, rs760168790, rs267607129

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reports of somatic SNVs/InDels in the PRM2 gene.

### Related Disease

Male infertility has been associated with variants in PRM2.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no established treatment for infertility caused by mutations in PRM2. Treatment options may include in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), depending on the severity of the condition. Prognosis may vary depending on the specific variant and the severity of the associated infertility.

### Drug Response

There is no known drug response associated with variants in PRM2.
