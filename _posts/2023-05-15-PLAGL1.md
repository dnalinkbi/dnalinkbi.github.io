## Gene: PLAGL1

### Genetic Position
PLAGL1 gene is located on chromosome 6q24.2 and contains 7 exons.

### Pathology and Function
PLAGL1 gene is known for its role in cellular growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. It acts as a transcription factor for various target genes that regulate cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and tumor suppression. Mutations in PLAGL1 have been associated with several types of cancers, including hepatoblastoma, lung cancer, ovarian, and breast cancer.
