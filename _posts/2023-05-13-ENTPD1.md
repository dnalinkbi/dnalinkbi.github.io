## Information about Gene ENTPD1

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 10: 54,791,698-54,842,469
- **Pathology:** ENTPD1 is associated with bone mineral density and may play a role in osteoporosis.
- **Function for Gene:** ENTPD1 encodes for the membrane-bound ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (NTPDase1), which is responsible for the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides into nucleosides.

### External IDs, Genomic Location, and Aliases
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 3371, NCBI Entrez: 953, Ensembl: ENSG00000119937, OMIM: 601282 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49961
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 10: 54,791,698-54,842,469
- **Aliases:** CD39, ATPDase1
