## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** PDE6A

**Function:** PDE6A encodes a protein called cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase 6 alpha subunit. This protein plays a critical role in the visual phototransduction cascade as it selectively hydrolyzes cyclic GMP (cGMP) at the photoreceptor outer segment. It plays a crucial role in maintaining normal vision.

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 8763
- NCBI Entrez: 5145
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116274
- OMIM: 180072
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16499

**Aliases:** CGMP phosphodiesterase 6 alpha-1 subunit, CGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 6A alpha-subunit, PDE6A1, RP43


**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

Mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for PDE6A.

**Related Disease:**

- Retinitis pigmentosa (RP): PDE6A mutations have been associated with an autosomal recessive form of RP. RP is a degenerative disorder of the retina that eventually leads to blindness.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

Currently, there is no cure for RP, and treatment aims to slow down the disease progression rather than reversing the damage. Treatment options include:
- Gene therapy to deliver functional copies of the PDE6A gene, which could potentially restore some vision in affected individuals. However, this therapy is still in clinical trials.
- Low-vision aids such as magnifying glasses, telescopes, and other assistive devices can help individuals with RP to navigate their daily lives.
- Lifestyle adjustments such as avoiding activities that require good night vision, maintaining a healthy diet, and protective eye-wear are recommended.

**Drug response:**

There is limited information available on the drug response of RP patients with PDE6A mutations.
