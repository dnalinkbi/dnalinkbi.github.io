# Gene Name: CHGA

## Basic Information
- **Function**: This gene encodes a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins, and it functions as a precursor molecule for the neuropeptide hormones vasostatin and chromogranin A (CgA). CgA is present in the secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine cells throughout the body, and it plays a role in the regulated secretion of peptides and hormones.
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 1113
    - Genomic Location: 14q32.12
    - Aliases: CgA, CGAK, SP-I

## Genetic Mutations
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: There are several genetic variations reported for this gene in the dbSNP database, but here are some of the known AA mutations with their dbSNP IDs:
    - p.Pro370Leu (rs3741046)
    - p.Asn264Ser (rs1047972)
    - p.Asp76Glu (rs4672505)
    - p.Ala6Thr (rs3741045)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are several somatic variations reported in the COSMIC database for this gene, but they do not have dbSNP IDs. 
- **Related Disease**: CgA levels are often used as a biomarker for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are a rare group of cancers that arise from cells in the endocrine and nervous systems. Elevated levels of CgA have been reported in patients with NETs, and measuring CgA levels can help diagnose the presence and progression of these tumors.
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: The treatment and prognosis for patients with NETs depends on the location and stage of the tumors. Surgery is often the primary treatment approach for localized NETs, but systemic therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy are also used depending on the extent and aggressiveness of the tumors.
- **Drug Response**: There is evidence to suggest that patients with high CgA levels may respond differently to certain treatments for NETs. For example, some studies have found that patients with elevated CgA levels are more likely to respond to somatostatin analogs, which are drugs that can help control the secretion of hormones and slow the growth of NETs.
