## Gene: PTGER2

### Genomic location and aliases:

- Gene ID: 5732
- Genomic location: Chromosome 14q22-q24.1
- Other aliases: EP2, PGE2 receptor EP2 subtype

### Function: 

PTGER2 encodes for the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor EP2 subtype, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family. PGE2 is a lipid mediator involved in various biological processes, including inflammation, immune modulation, and pain. Upon binding to the EP2 receptor, PGE2 activates intracellular signaling pathways that result in vasodilation, bronchodilation, and inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

### Related disease:

PTGER2 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammation, pain, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that PTGER2 expression is upregulated in several types of cancer, such as breast, lung, and colon cancer, and that it contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression.

### Treatment and prognosis:

There are currently no approved drugs that target PTGER2 directly. However, preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of EP2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, pain, and inflammation. The prognosis of diseases associated with PTGER2 expression depends on the type and stage of the disease.

### Drug response:

Several EP2 receptor antagonists have been developed and tested in preclinical studies, including TG6-10-1, TG4-155, and PF-04418948. These drugs have shown promising results in reducing tumor growth, inflammation, and pain in various preclinical models.
