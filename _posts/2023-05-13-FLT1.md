# Gene FLT1

## Information:
- **Function:** The FLT1 gene encodes a protein known as VEGFR1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1), which is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and lymphangiogenesis (formation of new lymphatic vessels) processes.
- **External IDs:** 
     - Gene ID: 2321
     - Genomic location: 13q12.3
     - Aliases: VEGFR1, FLT, FLT-1

     - c.1271C>T (p.Ala424Val) - Missense mutation, rs41303358
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Some somatic mutations identified in FLT1 with dbSNP ID:
     - c.2744G>A (p.Gly915Glu) - Missense mutation, rs143821838
     - c.2501C>G (p.Thr834Ser) - Missense mutation, rs146021819
     - c.2726C>T (p.Arg909Cys) - Missense mutation, rs143821809

## Related Diseases:
- Mutations in FLT1 have been found to be associated with several diseases such as:
     - Preeclampsia
     - Diabetic Retinopathy
     - Rheumatoid Arthritis
     - Cancers
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and outlook for diseases associated with mutations in FLT1 may vary depending on the disease and the severity of symptoms. Some common treatments for these diseases include anti-angiogenic drugs, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapies. 
- **Drug Response:** Mutations in FLT1 can alter the response of the body to certain drugs. For example, the presence of specific FLT1 mutations may affect the efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs.
