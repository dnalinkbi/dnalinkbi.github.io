# Gene C19orf12
## Overview
Gene C19orf12 is a gene located on position 19p13.2 of human chromosome 19. It codes for a protein of unknown function. The gene is also known as NBIA4 due to its association with Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 4, a rare neurological disorder. 

## Function
The exact function of the C19orf12 protein is not yet known. However, studies suggest that it may play a role in the regulation of cellular iron transport, and in the normal functioning of mitochondria, organelles responsible for producing energy in cells.
