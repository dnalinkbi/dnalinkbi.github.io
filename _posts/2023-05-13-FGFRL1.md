# Gene FGFRL1 Information

## Genetic Position

The FGFRL1 gene is located on chromosome 4q28.3.

## Pathology

Mutations in FGFRL1 have been associated with various cancers, including breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancer.

## Function

The FGFRL1 gene encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family. This receptor can act as a decoy receptor, binding to specific fibroblast growth factors and preventing them from binding to and activating other members of the family.
