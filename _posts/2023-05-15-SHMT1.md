# Information about Gene SHMT1

## Genetic Position
Gene SHMT1 is located on chromosome 17 at position 17q11.2.

## Pathology
Studies have shown that mutations in the SHMT1 gene can lead to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. It has also been found to be associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

## Function for Gene
The SHMT1 gene codes for the production of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which is an enzyme involved in the conversion of serine to glycine in the one-carbon metabolic pathway. One-carbon metabolism is essential for many biological processes, including nucleotide metabolism, methylation reactions, and redox homeostasis. The SHMT1 enzyme is particularly important in neurons, as it is involved in the production of glycine, which is necessary for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for SHMT1 in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SHMT1 gene have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. It has also been found to be associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for SHMT1-related conditions. Treatment for symptoms such as seizures and intellectual disability are based on the individual's specific needs. The prognosis for those with SHMT1-related conditions varies based on the specific mutation and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response specifically for SHMT1-related conditions.
