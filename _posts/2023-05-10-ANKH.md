## Information about gene ANKH

### Genetic position
Gene ANKH is located on chromosome 5q31.1.

### Pathology
Several genetic variations in the ANKH gene have been associated with a range of diseases, including:

- ***Craniometaphyseal dysplasia***: this is a rare bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone formation and mineralization that leads to thickening of cranial bones and distortion of facial features. Mutations in the ANKH gene have been identified as the underlying cause of this condition.
- ***Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition 1***: this is an inherited disorder characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in joints and soft tissues, leading to arthritis and other rheumatic symptoms. Variations in the ANKH gene have been shown to contribute to the development of this disorder.
- ***Chondrocalcinosis 2***: a condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in cartilage, leading to progressive joint damage and arthritis. Variations in the ANKH gene have been implicated in the etiology of this condition.

### Function for gene
The ANKH gene encodes a protein called ANKH, which belongs to the family of transmembrane proteins involved in ion transport across the cell membrane. Specifically, ANKH is responsible for transporting inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) out of the cell. PPi is an important regulator of bone mineralization and has been implicated in several pathological conditions related to abnormal bone formation.

### Related disease
Variations in ANKH gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Craniometaphyseal dysplasia
- Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition 1
- Chondrocalcinosis 2

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for ANKH-related diseases. However, symptomatic treatments like pain relief and joint replacement surgeries are available for certain conditions. The prognosis for ANKH-related diseases varies depending on the specific condition.

### Drug response
There is limited information available on drug response in ANKH-related diseases. However, a study has shown that the use of bisphosphonates may help alleviate symptoms in patients with craniometaphyseal dysplasia.
