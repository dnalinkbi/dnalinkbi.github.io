## Gene IDH3B

### Genetic Position
The gene IDH3B is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q11.23).

### Pathology and Function
IDH3B encodes the beta subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH3), an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle, which plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism. IDH3B is specifically involved in the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which provides energy to the cell. Mutations in IDH3B have been associated with various metabolic disorders, including mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) deficiency.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in IDH3B have been associated with various metabolic disorders, including MRC deficiency and mitochondrial diseases. Additionally, IDH3B has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers, such as gliomas, chondrosarcomas, and myeloid malignancies.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for IDH3B-related disorders depends on the severity and type of the disorder. For metabolic disorders, supportive therapy is the mainstay of treatment. For cancer, targeted drugs such as ivosidenib and enasidenib have been developed that inhibit mutated IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes, respectively. However, there is currently no specific treatment available for IDH3B mutations.

### Drug Response
Several drugs have been developed that target mutated IDH enzymes in cancer therapy, including IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors. However, there is currently no specific drug available that targets IDH3B mutations.
