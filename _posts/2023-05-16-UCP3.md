# Information on gene UCP3

## Genetic position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic position:** UCP3 (Uncoupling Protein 3) is located on chromosome 11q13.4.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in UCP3 have been linked to metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance.
- **Function:** UCP3 belongs to a family of mitochondrial carrier proteins that are involved in energy metabolism. It is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in the heart, adipose tissue, and liver. The protein uncouples the process of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in ATP synthesis and an increase in energy expenditure in the form of heat. The exact role of UCP3 in regulation of metabolic processes is still being studied.
