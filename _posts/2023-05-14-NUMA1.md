# Genetic Information for Gene NUMA1

## Overview
The **NUMA1** gene is an alias for the "nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1" gene located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.2). This gene codes for a protein called NuMA that plays a role in organizing and separating chromosomes during cell division. 

## Function 
NuMA is a structural protein that localizes to the nucleus during interphase and to spindle poles during mitosis. It is involved in the organization of microtubules and chromatin during mitosis, and its absence results in defects in spindle pole organization and chromosome segregation, leading to aneuploidy.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
*No clinically significant amino acid mutations identified*

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
*No somatic variants associated with cancer identified*

## Related Disease 
Abnormal expression or dysfunction of NuMA protein plays a role in various diseases, including:
- Cancer: Aberrant NuMA expression has been associated with several types of cancer, including breast, lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers. 
- Alzheimer's disease: NuMA has been found to colocalize with tau protein in the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. 
- Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG): A rare missense mutation in the NuMA1 gene (c.338T>C; p.Leu113Pro) has been associated with a risk of developing POAG.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are no targeted treatments for NuMA-related diseases at present. Treatment for cancer associated with NuMA overexpression typically includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and stage of diagnosis.

## Drug response
A study has investigated the effect of the drugs paclitaxel and vincristine on the expression and subcellular localization of NuMA in ovarian cancer cells. The results suggest that the efficacy of these drugs may be influenced by NuMA, and that co-targeting NuMA and microtubules may be a promising therapeutic strategy.
