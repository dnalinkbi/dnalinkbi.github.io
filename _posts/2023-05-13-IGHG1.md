## Information about Gene IGHG1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 14
- Genomic coordinates: 107,321,280-107,331,840

### Pathology
- Gene IGHG1 has been implicated in several diseases, including autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and primary Sjogren's syndrome.
- Additionally, it is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disorders.

### Function
- The IGHG1 gene encodes the gamma 1 heavy chain of immunoglobulin G (IgG).
- IgG is a glycoprotein that functions as an antibody, having a crucial role in immune-mediated defense against pathogens and toxins.
