# Gene: CORIN

- Function: The CORIN gene encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease that is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys. It plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure through the processing of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), which are involved in maintaining fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the body.

- Related disease: Mutations in the CORIN gene have been associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.

- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment of CORIN-related cardiovascular diseases currently focuses on managing symptoms, such as controlling blood pressure and fluid accumulation in the body. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and specific type of disease.

- Drug response: There is currently no specific drug targeting CORIN activity, but research is ongoing in the development of potential inhibitors.
