## Gene GSTP1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11: 67,266,198 - 67,273,278

**Pathology:** GSTP1 gene is involved in detoxification and plays a significant role in the metabolism of xenobiotics, including environmental carcinogens, chemotherapy agents, and steroid hormones. The reduced expression or activity of GSTP1 could lead to an increased susceptibility to cancer and other diseases.

**Function:** GSTP1 (Glutathione S-transferase pi 1) belongs to the family of GST enzymes. This gene encodes a protein that is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics through conjugation with glutathione.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.315C>T - rs1138272
- c.313A>G - rs1138274
- c.262T>A - rs11875028

**Related Disease:** GSTP1 is involved in several diseases, including:
- Cancer (breast, colorectal, lung, and gastric cancers)
- Parkinson's disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Asthma
- Atopic dermatitis

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Since GSTP1 is involved in multiple diseases, treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and individual factors. However, some studies have suggested that enhancing GSTP1 expression or activity could be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

**Drug Response:** Several anticancer drugs have been reported to interact with GSTP1, including platinum analogs, camptothecins, and epipodophyllotoxins. Moreover, some studies have shown that specific GSTP1 polymorphisms could influence drug response and toxicity.
