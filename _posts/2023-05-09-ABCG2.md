**AA Mutation List:**

- 34G>A (Ala12Thr) rs2231142
- 421C>A (Gln141Lys) rs2231137
- 623G>A (Gly208Arg) rs11568658
- 952G>A (Gly318Arg) rs1128503
- 1199G>A (Gly400Arg) rs2231141

**Mutation Type:**

- Missense Mutation

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID include:

- c.34G>A (p.Ala12Thr) rs2231142
- c.289C>T (p.Thr97Met) rs2229774

**Related Disease:**

ABCG2 has been associated with various cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, hematologic malignancies, and colorectal cancer.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

Due to the involvement of ABCG2 in chemoresistance, its inhibition has been proposed as a potential strategy to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. Further studies are still needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABCG2 inhibitors in cancer treatment.

**Drug Response:**

Some drugs have been reported to interact with ABCG2, including mitoxantrone, imatinib, and pravastatin.
