# Information about gene GREM1

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic position**: GREM1 gene is located on chromosome 15 at the locus q13.3. 

- **Pathology:** GREM1 has been associated with the development of multiple types of cancer, including colorectal, ovarian and endometrial cancer.

- **Function:** GREM1 encodes the protein gremlin-1, which is a secreted glycoprotein that functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. It plays a critical role in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation during embryonic development and tissue regeneration.

## Gene information

- **External IDs and Aliases:** GREM1 is also known as:

    - HGNC: 17827
    - Entrez Gene: 26585
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000166535
    - OMIM: 603054
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H772

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several amino acid (AA) mutations associated with GREM1, including:

    - c.622+1206G>A (rs16969681)
    - c.679G>A (rs17120682)
    - c.282G>A (rs3745069)
    - c.1029A>G (rs1801725)

    These mutations are associated with an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic SNVs/InDels associated with GREM1, including:

    - c.1047_1048delCT (rs140425213)
    - c.1021C>T (rs771449370)
    - c.769C>T (rs138426856)

## Related diseases

GREM1 has been associated with several diseases, including:

- Colorectal cancer
- Ovarian cancer 
- Endometrial cancer

## Treatment and prognosis

The overexpression of GREM1 has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor in several types of cancer. Targeting GREM1 may be a potential treatment strategy in cancers where it is overexpressed.

## Drug response

There are currently no drugs targeting GREM1 available on the market. However, preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of GREM1 may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.
