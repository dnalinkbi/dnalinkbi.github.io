### Information about Gene FLT4

**Genetic Position**: FLT4 gene is located on chromosome 5q35.3.

**Pathology**: Mutations in FLT4 gene have been associated with the development of Lymphedema, Nonne-Milroy type. 

**Function**: FLT4 gene encodes a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family of proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in lymphatic vessel development and maintenance. 

**External IDs and Aliases**:
- HGNC: 3765
- NCBI Entrez: 2324
- Ensembl: ENSG00000128310
- OMIM: 136352
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35916

Aliases include VEGFR3, FLT41.

**AA Mutation List**:
- p.Lys106Thr (rs139071351)
- p.Ile358Thr (rs72552713)
- p.Ser597Asn (rs121908027)

All three mutations are missense mutations.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels**:
- c.3174+48G>A (rs868738705)
- c.1704C>G (rs757687053)

Both mutations are SNVs.

**Related Disease**: Mutations in FLT4 gene have been associated with Nonne-Milroy Syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by lymphedema.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no cure for Nonne-Milroy Syndrome, and treatment options are limited to compression therapy, exercise, and skin care.

**Drug Response**: There is no known drug response associated with mutations in FLT4 gene.
