## Gene: NCF4

- **Function:** NCF4 (Neutrophil cytosolic factor 4) encodes for a protein called p40phox, which is a subunit of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils and other immune cells.   

- **External IDs:** 
  - Gene ID:  57147
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 22q13.1
  - Aliases: NCF4, SH3PXD4B, p40-PHOX

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
  - rs17849502 (p.Ala365Ser)
  - rs200675657 (p.Arg58His)
  - rs201253886 (p.Asn262Ser)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - rs1298245570 (c.199delT; p.Leu67Trpfs*30) - reported in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease

- **Related Disease:** NCF4 mutations have been associated with chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent infections and abnormal inflammation due to the impaired production of ROS by neutrophils and other immune cells.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for individuals with chronic granulomatous disease primarily involves prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals and interferon-gamma to reduce infections and inflammation. Bone marrow transplantation can be curative for some individuals with the disorder.

- **Drug Response:** The use of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can aggravate the symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease.
