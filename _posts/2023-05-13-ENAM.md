### Gene: ENAM

#### Function:
ENAM gene encodes a protein, enamelin, that is predominantly expressed in developing and mature enamel tissue. The protein is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hardest substance found in the human body. 

#### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 32552
- NCBI Entrez: 2025
- Ensembl: ENSG00000070526
- OMIM: 606585
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H3S4

#### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations documented for ENAM gene in the dbSNP database. Some of these mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:
- Gln236Ter (rs34603234)
- Thr648Met (rs150467167)
- Ala139Val (rs1558983336)

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for ENAM gene in the dbSNP database.

#### Related disease:
Mutations in ENAM gene are associated with Amelogenesis imperfecta, which is a group of inherited disorders that affect the development and mineralization of tooth enamel. These disorders cause teeth to be unusually small, discolored, pitted or grooved, and prone to rapid wear and breakage.

#### Treatment and prognosis:
Currently, there is no effective treatment or cure for Amelogenesis imperfecta. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms, such as using dental restorations, using fluoride treatments, and providing orthodontic care. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition.

#### Drug response:
There is no known drug response for ENAM gene.
