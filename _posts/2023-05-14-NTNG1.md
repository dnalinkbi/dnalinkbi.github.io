# Gene Information for NTNG1

## Gene Position 
- Gene: NTNG1 (Netrin-G1)
- Chromosome: 1
- Start Position: 108,506,618 bp
- End Position: 108,526,204 bp

## Pathology and Function
- Function: NTNG1 is a membrane-anchored protein that is involved in the development of nervous system cells. It plays a role in the formation of synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells.
- Pathology: Abnormal expression of NTNG1 has been implicated in various neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorders.
