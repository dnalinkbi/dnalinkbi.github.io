### **Gene: ECSIT**
- **Function for gene:** The ECSIT gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, which is an essential enzyme of the respiratory chain that generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. ECSIT protein also interacts with TAK1 to mediate the activation of MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no known somatic variations in ECSIT gene.

- **Related disease:** Mutations in the ECSIT gene are reported to cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects energy metabolism in mitochondria. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency can lead to a wide range of clinical symptoms, including hypotonia, developmental delay, epileptic seizures, and muscle weakness.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Treatment is mainly supportive and aims to alleviate symptoms. Prognosis depends on the severity and extent of the disease. Some individuals with mitochondrial complex I deficiency may have a normal lifespan, while others may have a severe form of the disease that is fatal in infancy.

- **Drug response:** There is no specific drug or treatment that is known to cure mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Some drugs, such as riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, and various vitamins, have been used to treat mitochondrial disorders with varying degrees of success.
