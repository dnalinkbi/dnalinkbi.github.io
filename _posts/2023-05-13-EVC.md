# Gene EVC

## Genetic Position
The EVC gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 22.1.

## Pathology
The EVC gene is known to be associated with two rare genetic disorders, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. These are rare autosomal recessive disorders that affect bone growth and heart development. Mutations in the EVC gene can lead to abnormal skeletal development, including short limbs, extra fingers or toes, and abnormal rib cage and pelvis.

## Function
The EVC gene encodes a protein that is involved in a signaling pathway that is critical for normal bone and heart development. Specifically, the protein is involved in the regulation and transport of a key signaling molecule, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), which plays an important role in cell differentiation and proliferation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the EVC gene.

## Related Diseases
The EVC gene is associated with two rare genetic disorders, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Both of these disorders are characterized by abnormal bone and limb development, as well as other physical abnormalities.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for EVC syndrome and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis is typically focused on managing the symptoms of the disease. This may involve surgical intervention to address orthopedic or cardiac abnormalities, as well as supportive care to address other complications.

## Drug Response
There are currently no known drugs that specifically target the EVC gene or its protein.
