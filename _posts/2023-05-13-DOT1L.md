# Gene: DOT1L

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- Genetic Position: Chromosome 19q13.1
- Pathology: Mutations in DOT1L have been linked with several human diseases, including leukemia and neurodevelopmental disorders. 
- Function: DOT1L is a histone methyltransferase that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and cell differentiation. Specifically, DOT1L methylates histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79), which is associated with active transcription.

## AA Mutation and dbSNP ID

- No AA mutations currently known in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- rs142281052: C>T substitution leading to p.R134W in a patient with non-specific intellectual disability.
- rs794726402: G>A substitution leading to p.E109K in a patient with Kleefstra syndrome.

## Related Disease

- DOT1L mutations have been associated with several human diseases, including:
    - Leukemia: DOT1L is frequently mutated in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), and overexpression of DOT1L has been linked with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
    - Kabuki Syndrome: rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and other health problems. 
    - Intellectual Disability: mutations in DOT1L have been linked to non-specific intellectual disability.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- DOT1L inhibitors have been developed as a potential treatment for leukemia. In preclinical studies, DOT1L inhibitors have shown promising results in inducing leukemia cell differentiation and reducing tumor growth.
- The prognosis for patients with DOT1L mutations depends on the specific disease and the severity of the mutation. Patients with Kabuki Syndrome may require long-term care and monitoring for associated health problems, while patients with leukemia may require aggressive treatment such as chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants.

## Drug Response

- DOT1L inhibitors, such as EPZ-5676 and pinometostat, have shown promising results in preclinical studies as potential treatments for leukemia.
