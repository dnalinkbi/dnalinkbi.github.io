# Information about gene BMP15

## Gene information
- Gene: **BMP15** (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15)
- Function: BMP15 belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and plays a crucial role in the regulation of folliculogenesis and ovulation in females.
- Genomic location:  Xq23-q27.3 
- Aliases: GDF9B, ODG1, BMP-15, XIEGDF, Growth differentiation factor 9B

## External IDs
- HGNC: 1075
- NCBI Entrez: 9210
- Ensembl: ENSG00000214702
- OMIM: 300247
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N8X1

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: BMP15 mutations have been described in patients with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian failure (POF). These mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations.
- Mutation type: Pathogenic, Uncertain significance
- dbSNP ID: rs137853195, rs137853191, rs137853210, rs137853202, rs139178645

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported.

## Related diseases
- Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
- Premature ovarian failure (POF)

## Treatment and prognosis
- There is currently no cure for POI/POF. However, hormonal therapy can be used to treat symptoms and reduce the risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease in affected women.

## Drug response
- FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) is commonly used in hormonal therapy for POI/POF patients.
