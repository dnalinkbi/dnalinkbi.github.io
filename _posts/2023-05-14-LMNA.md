# Information on gene LMNA

LMNA is a human gene that encodes for lamin A/C proteins. These proteins are involved in maintaining the structure and integrity of the nuclear envelope in cells. 

## Function for gene
The gene is responsible for the creation of lamin A/C proteins which are involved in the formation of the nuclear envelope and in stabilizing the genome integrity.

## Related Disease:
Mutations in the LMNA gene are associated with several diseases including: 
- Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 
- Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome 
- Dilated cardiomyopathy type 1A 
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B1

## Treatment and prognosis:
There is currently no definitive treatment for LMNA-related diseases. The treatment is mainly symptomatic which includes pain management, physical therapy, and the use of a pacemaker in some cases.

## Drug response:
There is no specific drug for LMNA-related diseases, but clinical trials are ongoing in the field of gene therapy.
