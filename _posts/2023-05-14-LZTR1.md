## Gene LZTR1

**Genetic Position:** This gene is located on chromosome 22q11.21. It spans 201,692 base pairs and has 16 exons.

**Function:** LZTR1 (leucine zipper-like transcription regulator 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a protein involved in the inhibition of Ras signaling. It is also involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway.

**External IDs and Aliases:** This gene is also known as Leucine-zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 and Zinc finger protein 703. The external IDs for this gene are: HGNC: 18176; NCBI Entrez: 8217; Ensembl: ENSG00000157083; OMIM: 616291; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6ZN44.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:** The following are the AA mutations known to be associated with LZTR1 with their corresponding mutation types and dbSNP IDs:
- R222C (Missense variant; rs780946383)
- S1139L (Missense variant; rs878853047)
- L1130P (Missense variant; rs768257855)
- E773K (Missense variant; rs767701574)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** The following are the somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) associated with LZTR1 with their corresponding dbSNP IDs:
- c.3299delA (rs770552578)
- c.2234C>T (rs869025161)
- c.458C>T (rs866558963)
- c.3187C>A (rs373253896)
- c.1375C>G (rs866233840)

**Related Disease:** LZTR1 mutations have been associated with multiple human diseases, including: Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (NSLL/JMML), schwannomatosis, and glioblastoma.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no specific treatment available for LZTR1 mutations. The treatment varies depending on the associated disease. The prognosis is generally poor due to the association with severe diseases such as glioblastoma.

**Drug Response:** There is no known drug response associated specifically with LZTR1 mutations.
