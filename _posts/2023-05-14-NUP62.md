# Information on Gene NUP62

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Location: 19q13.32

## Pathology
- NUP62 gene mutations have been linked to the development of autoimmune diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Function
- The NUP62 gene encodes a protein involved in the formation of nuclear pore complexes. These complexes regulate the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 8023
- NCBI Entrez: 23636
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104497
- OMIM: 602421
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P37198
- Aliases: NUP153, GLFG2, NUP58, Nucleoporin 62, Nucleoporin Nup62

## Related Disease
- Primary biliary cirrhosis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment depends on the severity and progression of the associated disease.
- Prognosis varies depending on the individual's response to treatment and the stage of disease at diagnosis.

## Drug Response
- No significant drug response information is available for NUP62 gene mutations.
