## Gene: IRAK4

### Genetic Position 
IRAK4 (Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X at position Xq28. 

### Pathology
Mutations in the IRAK4 gene have been linked to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Omenn Syndrome, autosomal recessive interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiency and invasive pneumococcal infection are the diseases linked with irak4 mutations.

### Function for gene
IRAK4 plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous ligands. It is essential for the activation of NF-kB and MAPK signaling pathways, leading to the production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are various mutations in the IRAK4 gene that includes missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations. The following are the AA changes reported in the IRAK4 gene: 

|Mutation        | Type           | dbSNP ID  |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|p.Thr48Met|missense|rs111033581|
|p.Pro126Ser|missense|rs137854535|
|p.Ser180Cys|missense|rs201312397|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID are reported in the IRAK4 gene so far.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the IRAK4 gene are associated with primary immunodeficiency disorders including Omenn Syndrome, autosomal recessive interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiency, and invasive pneumococcal infection.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Patients with mutations in the IRAK4 gene are vulnerable to recurrent bacterial infections. The treatment of such patients involves antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis of individuals with IRAK4 deficiency varies with the severity of the symptoms and susceptibility to infections.

### Drug Response
Recent research studies show that certain stimulators of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) like BCG vaccine, CpG, and TLR4 agonist can be used effectively in treating immunodeficiency disorders with IRAK4 deficiency.
