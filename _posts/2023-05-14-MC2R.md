# Gene: MC2R

### Pathology:

MC2R (Melanocortin Receptor 2) gene is located on Chromosome 18 at position q21.32 and encodes for a Protein of 297 amino acids. The MC2R receptor is mainly found in the adrenal gland and is involved in the regulation of adrenal function, especially the production of corticosteroids. Alterations in this gene have been linked to pathologies such as familial glucocorticoid deficiency 1 (FGD1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe cortisol deficiency.

### Function:

The protein encoded by MC2R is a type of G-protein coupled receptor that binds to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and triggers a signaling cascade that regulates the production of corticosteroids, hormones that are essential for the normal function of the body during conditions of stress.

### External IDs and Aliases:

External IDs for MC2R include HGNC: 6908, NCBI Gene ID: 4158, Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000198452, OMIM ID: 607397, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P32248.

Some of the aliases for MC2R gene include Adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor, ACTH receptor, ACTH-R, Adrenocorticotropin receptor, and Melanocortin receptor type 2.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

The following are some AA mutations in MC2R gene with dbSNP ID:

|AA change|Mutation type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|------------|--------|
|Gly12Arg|Missense|rs121912778|
|Ser74Ile|Missense|rs121912779|
|Arg84Cys|Missense|rs61739557|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

There is no information available on somatic variants of MC2R gene.

### Related Disease:

Variations in MC2R gene have been associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency 1, which is characterized by a low production of cortisol, and an increased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). 

### Treatment and prognosis:

The treatment for familial glucocorticoid deficiency 1 involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.

### Drug response:

There is no information available on drug response for MC2R gene.
