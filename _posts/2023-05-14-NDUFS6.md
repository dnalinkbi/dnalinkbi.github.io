# Gene: NDUFS6

## Information

### Genetic Position
NDUFS6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.2 (19q13.2).

### Pathology
Mutations in NDUFS6 have been linked to mitochondrial complex I deficiency. 

### Function
NDUFS6 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which plays a crucial role in the respiratory electron transport chain.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in NDUFS6.

### Related disease
Mutations in NDUFS6 have been linked to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can manifest as Leigh syndrome, encephalomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy.

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for mitochondrial complex I deficiency is currently limited to supportive measures such as symptom management and dietary interventions. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the deficiency and the extent of organ involvement.

### Drug response
There is currently no known drug response specifically targeting mutations in NDUFS6.
