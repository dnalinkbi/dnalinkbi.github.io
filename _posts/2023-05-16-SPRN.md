## Gene information for SPRN

### Genetic position
- SPRN (shadow of prion protein homolog) gene is located on chromosome 20.
- The genomic location of SPRN is 20p13.

### Pathology 
- SPRN gene is associated with prion diseases.
- The SPRN protein has been found to have a role in neurodegeneration, perhaps by promoting the self-assembly of amyloid-beta fibrils.

### Function 
- The exact function of SPRN gene is not very well understood; however, it is believed to have a role in the regulation of prion protein conversion.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 11203
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 10201
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000149231
- OMIM ID: 606348
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9UQ52
- Aliases: SPRN, Sho, Shadoo

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- No missense variants have been reported for this gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic variants have been reported for this gene.

### Related disease
- Prion diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) are associated with mutations in this gene.

### Treatment and prognosis
- There is currently no cure available for prion diseases.
- Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care.

### Drug response
- There is no drug available specifically for the treatment of prion diseases.
- A number of drugs are under investigation as potential treatments for prion diseases, including quinacrine, pentosan polysulfate, and tetracyclines.
