# Gene MMP9

## 1. Genetic Position

The MMP9 gene is located on chromosome 20q13.12, spanning approximately 27 kilobases (kb) on the genomic DNA.

## 2. Pathology and Function

MMP9, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 9, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, which plays a critical role in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. This gene is associated with various pathological conditions, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.

## 3. External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location

- HGNC ID: 7176
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 4318
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000242219
- OMIM ID: 120360
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P14780
- Aliases: CLG4B, GELB, MANDP2

## 4. AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- rs17576: A/G, missense mutation, resulting in the substitution of alanine with threonine at position 20 (A20T).
- rs201074739: C/T, missense mutation, resulting in the substitution of glycine with cysteine at position 157 (G157C).
- rs45540935: G/A, synonymous mutation, resulting in no amino acid change.

## 5. Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported in the MMP9 gene. Here are some examples:

- rs587779308: G/C, missense mutation, resulting in the substitution of serine with cysteine at position 175 (S175C).
- rs1586152020: T/C, frameshift mutation, resulting in a premature stop codon at position 188 (p.R188*).

## 6. Related Diseases

MMP9 gene mutations have been associated with various diseases, including:

- Multiple sclerosis
- Cancer, including breast, lung, and gastric cancer
- Cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis
- Osteoarthritis
- Alzheimer's disease

## 7. Treatment and Prognosis

Treatments for diseases related to MMP9 mutations depend on the specific condition. For example, drugs that inhibit MMP9 activity are being investigated as a potential therapeutic option for osteoarthritis and certain types of cancer.

The prognosis for individuals with MMP9 mutations also varies depending on the disease and its severity.

## 8. Drug Response

There is some evidence to suggest that MMP9 inhibitors may be effective in treating certain types of cancer. However, more research is needed to determine their precise mechanisms of action and potential side effects.
