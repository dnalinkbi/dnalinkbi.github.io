# Information about gene MEIS1

## Genetic Position and Function

- MEIS1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p14) and spans a genomic region of approximately 107 kilobases. 
- It belongs to the homeobox family of genes and encodes a transcription factor involved in embryonic development and hematopoietic differentiation. 
- MEIS1 is also implicated in regulating circadian rhythms, muscle development, and neuronal differentiation. 

## External IDs and aliases

- Gene ID: 4211 
- HGNC ID: 6998 
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000115271 
- OMIM ID: 601739 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O00470 
- Aliases: Homeobox protein Meis1, Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog, Three amino acid loop extension protein 1 

## AA mutations and mutation types with dbSNP ID

- MEIS1 has multiple missense mutations that have been reported in various cancers. 
- A common mutation is rs6489630, which involves a substitution of serine with alanine at position 262 (S262A). This mutation is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- MEIS1 has been found to be somatically mutated in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and lung cancer. 
- Some common somatic mutations in MEIS1 include rs11697821 and rs13182821. 

## Related diseases

- MEIS1 mutations have been associated with various diseases, including developmental disorders such as Kabuki syndrome, as well as cancer.
- MEIS1 is also implicated in other diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- MEIS1 is a potential therapeutic target in leukemia due to its critical role in hematopoietic development. 
- Its expression levels have been associated with prognosis in various cancers. High expression of MEIS1 is associated with poor outcome in AML, while low expression of MEIS1 is associated with poor outcome in neuroblastoma. 

## Drug response

- Studies have shown that MEIS1 expression levels may predict drug response in certain cancers. 
- MEIS1 has been found to modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in AML and ovarian cancer.
