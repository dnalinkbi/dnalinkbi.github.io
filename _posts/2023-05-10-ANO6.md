## Gene ANO6

### Genetic Position and Pathology

- **Genetic Position:** ANO6 gene is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q12.3. 

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the ANO6 gene have been associated with various diseases including Scott syndrome, gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia and gnathodiaphyseal-like syndrome.

### Function for Gene 

The ANO6 gene encodes for a protein called Anoctamin 6 which is a calcium-activated chloride channel and has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes including blood coagulation, smooth muscle contraction, and cancer progression.
