# Information about Gene SMAD5

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- **Gene:** SMAD5
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 5: 5q31.3
- **Aliases:** MADH5, JV4-1

**Function of gene:** SMAD5 is a member of the SMAD family of proteins that play a crucial role in the signal transduction of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. It is involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. SMAD5 mediates the TGF-beta signaling by forming complexes with receptor-activated SMAD proteins, which regulates target genes' transcription.

- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000113695
- **OMIM:** 601569
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q99717

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg130Ser (rs199822144)
- p.Ala236Thr (rs886042035)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.392G>A (rs200274308)

**Related Disease:** SMAD5 mutations are linked with several diseases, including vascular malformation syndrome and colorectal cancer.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no specific treatment for SMAD5 gene mutations, but a molecular diagnosis of SMAD5 mutations in patients with vascular malformations could improve clinical surveillance.

**Drug Response:** No specific drug response associated with the SMAD5 gene mutation, but therapeutic drugs targeting the TGF-beta signaling pathway could potentially be effective in treating related diseases.
