# Gene ROBO1

## Genetic Position
ROBO1 is located on chromosome 3q12.1.

## Pathology
ROBO1 mutations have been associated with various diseases, including lung cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia.

## Function
ROBO1 is a transmembrane receptor that plays a role in axon guidance and neuronal migration during development. It is also involved in angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis.
