# Gene: CATSPER1

The CATSPER1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 15.3. 

## Function:

The CATSPER1 (Cation Channel Sperm Associated 1) gene encodes a protein that forms a subunit of the sperm-specific CatSper ion channel, which is found in the tail of sperm. This channel is important for the influx of calcium ions required for motility and fertilization.
