# Gene: IFNGR2

## Information:

### Pathology:
The IFNGR2 gene encodes for the Interferon gamma receptor 2 which is involved in the regulation of the immune system. Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases such as mycobacterium tuberculosis.

### Function:
The IFNGR2 protein is part of the Interferon gamma receptor complex which plays a crucial role in the immune system's response to inflammation and infections. The receptor is involved in the transduction of the interferon gamma signal from the extracellular space into the cell.

### External IDs and Genomic Location:
- HGNC: 5432
- NCBI Entrez: 3460
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137868
- OMIM: 147569
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P38484
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 21q22.11

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
- c.416G>A (p.Arg139His) rs104894361
- c.722C>G (p.Arg241Gly) rs193920687
- c.804C>A (p.Pro268Thr) rs201779053 
- c.838G>A (p.Val280Met) rs28929474

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- c.661G>A (p.Gly221Ser) rs483352852 
- c.760G>A (p.Cys254Tyr) rs796059503 

### Related Disease:
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection susceptibility was associated with a frameshift mutation in IFNGR2, resulting in an early stop codon.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Antibiotic treatment can be effective for controlling infections in cases with a compromised immune response due to IFNGR2 mutations.

### Drug Response:
Some studies have suggested that patients with defects in the interferon-gamma pathway might benefit from IFN-γ therapy.
