# Information about Gene GYS1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

The GYS1 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.3 and encodes the glycogen synthase 1 enzyme. This enzyme is important for the synthesis of glycogen, which is the main storage form of glucose in the body. Mutations in the GYS1 gene have been associated with glyocogen storage disease type 0 (GSD-0), which is characterized by fasting hypoglycemia and elevated levels of ketone bodies. 

## Function for Gene

The GYS1 gene encodes the glycogen synthase 1 enzyme, which is responsible for converting glucose-6-phosphate into glycogen for storage in liver and muscle tissues.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several reported mutations in the GYS1 gene that are associated with GSD-0. These include missense mutations such as p.Arg43Trp (rs104894424) and p.Leu71Pro (rs137852906), as well as splicing mutations such as c.767+1G>A (rs797045142) and c.760-2A>G (rs797045143). 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the GYS1 gene. 

## Related Disease

Mutations in the GYS1 gene are associated with Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0 (GSD-0), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by fasting hypoglycemia, elevated levels of ketone bodies, and hepatomegaly. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for GSD-0 typically involves frequent feedings of a high-carbohydrate diet to maintain blood glucose levels. Prognosis is generally good with proper treatment. 

## Drug Response

There are currently no reported drug therapies for GSD-0.
