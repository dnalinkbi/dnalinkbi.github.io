## Gene: PLCG2

### Function:
The PLCG2 gene encodes for a phospholipase enzyme involved in cellular signaling pathways, specifically the activation of the B-cell receptor.

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 9069
- NCBI Entrez: 5336
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171560
- OMIM: 600220
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16885

### AA Mutation list:
- R665W (dbSNP ID: rs72824905)
- R707Q (dbSNP ID: rs121918460)
- D993G (dbSNP ID: rs143980279)
- A1179P (dbSNP ID: rs200746720)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels:
- c.1661G>A (p.R554H) (dbSNP ID: rs145239317)
- c.1964A>G (p.I655V) (dbSNP ID: rs76764985)

### Related Disease:
- PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID) syndrome
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Alzheimer's disease
- Atopic dermatitis

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment options vary depending on the disease associated with the PLCG2 mutation. In APLAID syndrome, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be an option. For rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) and biologic agents may be prescribed.

### Drug Response:
In a study on Alzheimer's disease, it was found that patients with the p.R522H variant in the PLCG2 gene responded better to a certain drug therapy, highlighting the potential for personalized medicine in treating this disease.
