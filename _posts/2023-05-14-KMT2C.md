# Gene Information for KMT2C

## Position
The KMT2C gene is located on chromosome 7q36.3.

## Pathology
KMT2C mutations have been associated with multiple cancers, including leukemia, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. Additionally, KMT2C mutations have been implicated in developmental disorders, such as Kabuki syndrome and intellectual disability.

## Function
The KMT2C gene encodes a histone methyltransferase that is involved in modifying chromatin structure and regulating gene expression.
