## Information about gene CASP8

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic position**: CASP8 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 33.2.

- **Pathology**: Mutations in CASP8 have been associated with various diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.

- **Function for gene**: CASP8 gene encodes a protein called caspase-8, which is a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death), NF-κB signaling pathway, and various other cellular processes.
