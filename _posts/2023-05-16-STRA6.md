# Information about Gene STRA6

## Genetic Position

The STRA6 gene is located on chromosome 15 at the position  q24.2. It spans approximately 50.03 kilobases (kb).

## Pathology and Function

The STRA6 gene encodes a protein known as stimulated by retinoic acid 6. This protein is a membrane receptor for retinol-binding protein and is responsible for mediating the cellular uptake of vitamin A (retinol). Mutations in this gene have been associated with a variety of diseases including Matthew-Wood syndrome, microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome, and anophthalmia/microphthalmia.
