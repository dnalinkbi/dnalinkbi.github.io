# Gene information

## Gene name and location

Gene: MED12  
External IDs: HGNC:6945, NCBI Entrez Gene: 11200, Ensembl: ENSG00000136237  
Aliases: THRAP2, ARC240, CAGH44, HOPA, OPA2, CDK8IP

Genomic location: Chromosome X: 70,091,720-70,228,032 bp

## Function

MED12 gene encodes a mediator complex subunit. It plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by acting as a bridge between transcriptional activators and RNA polymerase II. Additionally, it is also involved in other cellular processes such as DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID for MED12 gene are as follows:

| Protein Position | Amino acid change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| 44              | Isoleucine to Valine      | Germline      | rs758175287 |
| 44              | Isoleucine to Lysine       | Germline      | rs61754244  |
