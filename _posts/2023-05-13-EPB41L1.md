## Information about Gene EPB41L1

### Genetic Position
Chromosome: 20

Location: q11.2

### Pathology
EPB41L1 gene is involved in various cancer progression and metastasis. It regulates the cytoskeleton and cell shape by interacting with actin and spectrin. Abnormal expression or mutations in this gene have shown to be related to various types of cancers such as gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

### Function
The EPB41L1 gene encodes for the protein 4.1B, which is involved in the formation of cell-cell contacts, cell migration, and maintenance of cell shape. It is also important for normal red blood cell development.
