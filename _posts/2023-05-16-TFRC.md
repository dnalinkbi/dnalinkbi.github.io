## Gene TFRC

### Genetic Position
TFRC gene is located on Chromosome 3q29, spanning from 196,067,784 to 196,124,090 base pairs.

### Pathology
Mutations and dysregulation in TFRC gene is associated with various pathological conditions such as malignancies, anemia, and neurodegeneration.

### Function
TFRC gene encodes for Transferrin receptor protein which is responsible for iron uptake and transportation into cells. Transferrin receptor protein has a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation.
