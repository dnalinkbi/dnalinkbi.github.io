# Gene: PML

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 15
- Location: 15q24.1
- Strand: Plus

## Pathology
The PML gene is associated with different types of cancers, and the t(15;17) translocation that involves the fusion of PML with the RARA gene results in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

## Function
The PML gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the formation of nuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). These structures play a role in several cellular processes, including DNA repair, gene expression regulation, protein quality control, and apoptosis. Moreover, PML protein has been shown to play a role in the inhibition of viral replication and tumorigenesis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of PML-associated diseases largely depend on the specific disease and its stage of progression. Different treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy, are usually used in combination to manage the disease and prolong the patient's survival.

## Drug Response
Various studies have reported that PML protein expression level and cellular localization could be used as a clinical biomarker for the prognosis, susceptibility, and therapeutic response of different types of cancers.
