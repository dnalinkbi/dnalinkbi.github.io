# Information on Gene C1QC

## Genetic Position
- C1QC is located on chromosome 1q31.2.

## Pathology
- Inherited deficiency of C1QC has been linked to an increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
- C1QC mutations have also been found in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

## Function
- C1QC encodes a subunit of the C1q protein, which is involved in the classical pathway of complement activation.
- C1q is responsible for the recognition and clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 1272
- NCBI Entrez: 713
- Ensembl: ENSG00000204203
- OMIM: 120550
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P02747
- Alias: C1QC, A259

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg14Ter (rs775635143): a nonsense mutation that results in premature termination of the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for C1QC in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
- Inherited deficiency of C1QC has been linked to an increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
- C1QC mutations have also been found in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for SLE.
- Treatment options aim to manage symptoms and prevent organ damage.
- The prognosis for SLE varies depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to treatment.
- Treatment options for AMD include anti-VEGF therapy and photodynamic therapy.

## Drug Response
- C1q is a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases such as SLE.
- Targeting C1q could help reduce inflammation and prevent tissue damage.
