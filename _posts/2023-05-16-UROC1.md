- NCBI Entrez: 10093
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163888
- OMIM: 276880
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9P2R7

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
- No pathogenic variants have been reported in the UROC1 gene yet.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
- No somatic variants have been reported yet.

**Related diseases**:
- Urocanic aciduria (rare inherited disorder)

**Treatment and prognosis**:
- No curative treatment is available for urocanic aciduria, however, some treatments can improve symptoms. The prognosis of urocanic aciduria varies depending on the severity of symptoms and age at diagnosis.
