# Information about MT-TY Gene

## Genetic Position

MT-TY is a gene located on the human mitochondrial DNA. It is found on the heavy strand, between nucleotides 5819 and 6480.

## Pathology

Mutations in the MT-TY gene have been associated with several diseases, including neuropathy, ataxia, pigmentary retinopathy, and Leigh syndrome.

## Function

MT-TY encodes a transfer RNA molecule that functions in the mitochondrial translation system. Specifically, it is responsible for inserting tyrosine into nascent polypeptide chains.

## Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases

- Gene: MT-TY
- Genomic Location: MT (mitochondrial DNA)
- Aliases: tRNA-Tyr, MTT
