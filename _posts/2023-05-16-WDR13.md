# Gene WDR13

## Genetic Position
WDR13 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.33).

## Pathology
Studies indicate that WDR13 is downregulated in various malignancies, including lung cancer and glioma.

## Function
The WDR13 gene encodes a protein from the WD repeat family of proteins. This protein is involved in RNA splicing, and it is believed that it regulates alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in a tissue-specific manner.
