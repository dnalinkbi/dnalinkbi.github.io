## Gene: MDM4 

### Function for gene
MDM4 (also known as MDMX) is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor gene p53. It binds to p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, leading to the inhibition of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Therefore, MDM4 plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.

### External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- HGNC ID: 6973
- Entrez Gene ID: 4194
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000198691
- OMIM ID: 602704
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O15151
- Genomic location: Chromosome 1 (1q32.1)

Aliases: MDMX, HDMX, JDM1, MRP1, Mdm4-p2

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are multiple AA mutations reported for MDM4, including:
- p.Arg55Cys (rs3737597)
- p.Ser100Phe (rs2287876)
- p.Pro193Ser (rs35607038)
- p.Arg258Gly (rs199727946)
- p.Asp289His (rs587782383)

These mutations can be categorized into missense mutations, which lead to the substitution of a single amino acid in the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs/InDels for MDM4 have been reported in cancer, including:
- c.359C>T (rs587782383)
- c.89G>A (rs587782154)
- c.287A>G (rs587782376)
- c.194C>T (rs148770987)

### Related disease
MDM4 has been implicated in various types of cancer, including:
- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Melanoma
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

### Treatment and prognosis
Targeting MDM4 has emerged as a potential strategy for cancer therapy. Several MDM4 inhibitors are currently being developed and tested in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the prognosis and treatment options for cancer patients with MDM4 mutations depend on various factors, such as the type of cancer, stage, and individual patient characteristics.

### Drug response
Several MDM4 inhibitors have shown promising results in preclinical studies, such as NSC207895, AMG232, and RG7388. However, their efficacy and safety are still being evaluated in clinical trials.
