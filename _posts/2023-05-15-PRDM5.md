# Gene PRDM5

- Function: PR domain zinc finger protein 5 (PRDM5) is a transcriptional repressor that has been implicated in tumor suppression. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

- External IDs:
    - Gene ID: 11184
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 4 (4q25)
    - Aliases: KMT8E, JARID1E, RIZ2, RIZ1

- External sites:
    - HGNC: 18745
    - NCBI Entrez: 11184
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000164136
    - OMIM: 610183

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: There are several amino acid mutations reported in PRDM5. For example, p.Arg589Gln (rs149468015) is a missense mutation that has been associated with breast cancer.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: There are several somatic mutations reported in PRDM5. For example, rs137853956 is a missense mutation that has been associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

- Related disease: Aberrant PRDM5 expression has been found in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia. PRDM5 downregulation has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.

- Treatment and prognosis: There is currently no specific treatment for PRDM5-related diseases. Studies have suggested that PRDM5 might be a potential therapeutic target in cancer.

- Drug response: There is no known drug that specifically targets PRDM5.
