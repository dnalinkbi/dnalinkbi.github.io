## Gene DOCK9

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 13
- Location: 13q22.3

### Pathology and Function
- DOCK9 gene encodes a member of the DOCK180 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that are implicated in cell signaling and cytoskeletal remodeling.
- It plays a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic function, and plasticity in the brain.
- DOCK9 has been associated with nervous system disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.
