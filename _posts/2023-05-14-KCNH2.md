# Information about gene KCNH2

## Genetic position
The KCNH2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q36.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in the KCNH2 gene are associated with long QT syndrome, which is a heart rhythm disorder. Long QT syndrome can cause sudden, uncontrollable, and dangerous arrhythmias that can lead to fainting, seizures, or even sudden death.

## Function for gene
The KCNH2 gene encodes a potassium channel that is important for regulating the electrical activity of the heart. Specifically, it helps to repolarize cardiomyocytes during the cardiac action potential.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for KCNH2 gene.

## Related disease
Long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome are some of the diseases associated with KCNH2 gene mutations.

## Treatment and prognosis
Long QT syndrome can be treated with beta-blockers to decrease the likelihood of developing arrhythmias. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) can also be used in severe cases to prevent sudden cardiac death.

## Drug response
Some drugs, such as certain antidepressants and antibiotics, can increase the risk of arrhythmias in patients with long QT syndrome. Avoiding these drugs can be important for management of this condition.
