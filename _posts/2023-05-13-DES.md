## Gene: DES

### Genetic Position:
- The DES gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q35.

### Pathology:
- Mutations in the DES gene are often associated with cardiomyopathy and myopathy.

### Function:
- The DES gene encodes the protein desmin, which is found primarily in muscle tissue and helps with the structural organization of muscle fibers.

### External IDs:
- Gene ID: 1674
- Genomic location: NC_000002.12 (38681020..38715343)
- Aliases: CMD1I, CSM1, CSM2, CSM3, DESM

### Related Disease:
- Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1I (CMD1I); Desmin-related myopathy
- Cardiomyopathy, familial hypertrophic, 1 (CMH1)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment for cardiomyopathy or myopathy caused by DES mutations may involve medication, lifestyle changes, or surgery.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

### Drug Response:
- No specific drug response information is available for DES mutations.
