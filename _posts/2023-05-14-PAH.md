## Gene PAH
The gene PAH provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This enzyme converts the amino acid phenylalanine to another amino acid called tyrosine. Mutations in the PAH gene can lead to phenylketonuria, an inherited disorder that causes an increase in phenylalanine levels in the blood and can cause intellectual disability if left untreated.

### Function of the gene
The PAH gene provides instructions for the production of the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, which converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the PAH gene.

### Related disease
Mutations in the PAH gene can cause phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited disorder that can cause intellectual disability and other neurological problems if left untreated.

### Treatment and prognosis
PKU can be managed with a special diet that limits phenylalanine intake. Early detection and treatment can prevent intellectual disability and other symptoms associated with the disorder.

### Drug response
There are currently no known drugs that specifically target the PAH gene.
