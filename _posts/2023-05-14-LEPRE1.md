# Gene Information

## Gene Name and Genomic Location
The gene of interest is **LEPRE1**, which is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1p34.2.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 16699
- NCBI Entrez: 64175
- Ensembl: ENSG00000117152
- OMIM: 610915
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86T07

Aliases: PPIB2, PPIB-2, LEPREL1, P3H2, LH2

## Function
The LEPRE1 gene encodes for a protein called prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2, which is involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. This protein hydroxylates specific proline residues on procollagen chains, which allows for proper collagen folding and stability.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
No amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for the LEPRE1 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or insertions/deletions (InDels) have been reported for the LEPRE1 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the LEPRE1 gene are associated with the autosomal recessive disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)-type VIII, which is characterized by bone fragility, skeletal deformities, and growth deficiency.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for OI-type VIII. Treatment options include physical therapy, bracing, and bisphosphonate therapy to increase bone density, as well as surgical interventions to correct bone deformities.

## Drug Response
No drug response information is available for OI-type VIII associated with LEPRE1 mutations.
