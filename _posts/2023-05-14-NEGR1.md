## Gene Information: NEGR1 

NEGR1 gene encodes an IgLON family member protein located on the surface of neurons and plays an important role in regulating cell-to-cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity in mammalian brain. Studies suggest that NEGR1 might be a potential therapeutic target for treating obesity and metabolic disorders. Disruption or abnormal function of NEGR1 has been linked to several diseases such as breast cancer, obesity, and schizophrenia.

## Gene Details:

## Related Diseases:
- Breast cancer
- Obesity
- Schizophrenia

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- There is no definitive cure or treatment for genetic mutations in NEGR1. However, certain drug therapies, microRNA-based therapies, and gene therapy approaches are under consideration for treating NEGR1-associated diseases such as breast cancer, obesity, and schizophrenia. 
- Prognosis is generally dependent on the severity of the disease and the response to available therapies.

## Drug Response:
- Recent studies have shown that NEGR1 inhibition can lead to improved insulin resistance and body weight reduction, making NEGR1 a potential drug target for obesity-related metabolic disorders.
