## Gene Information

- **Gene Name:** IFIH1
- **Function:** The IFIH1 gene encodes the interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1, which belongs to the family of DEAD-box proteins and functions as a cytosolic sensor of viral RNA, triggering type I interferon-mediated immune responses.

- **External IDs:** 
    * HGNC: 29492
    * NCBI Entrez Gene: 64135
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000126709
    * OMIM: 606951
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BYX4

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2q24.3
    
- **Aliases:** 
    * DEXH box-containing protein 9 (DHX9)
    * Helicard
    * Interferon-induced with helicase C domain protein 1 (IFIH1)
    * Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)
    * RNA helicase-DEAD box protein 116 (DDX116)

## Related Disease

- **Disease:** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- **Association:** Several studies have shown that IFIH1 variants are associated with an increased risk of developing SLE. The protein encoded by IFIH1 plays a key role in the activation of innate immunity and the production of type I interferon, which are both dysregulated in SLE.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for SLE, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent damage to organs. The treatment options for SLE vary depending on the severity and type of symptoms, and may include medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antimalarials.

- Prognosis for SLE patients varies greatly and depends on various factors such as age, disease severity, organ involvement, and comorbidities.

## Drug Response

- Some studies have suggested that IFIH1 variants may influence the response to certain drugs used to treat SLE such as hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids.
