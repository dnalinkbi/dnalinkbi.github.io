# Gene PSTPIP1

## Information
* **Genetic position:** Chromosome 15, location q24.3
* **Pathology:** PSTPIP1 is associated with autoinflammatory diseases such as PAPA syndrome and pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome (PAPA syndrome)
* **Function:** PSTPIP1 encodes a scaffold protein that may play a role in regulating immune responses and actin cytoskeleton organization.

## Identifiers and Aliases
* **Gene ID:** 9051
* **Aliases:** CD2BP1, PESTYP, PSTS1

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for autoinflammatory diseases caused by PSTPIP1 mutations. Treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help manage symptoms. Immunosuppressant therapy can also be considered for more severe cases.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response for PSTPIP1-associated diseases. However, some studies have suggested that TNF-alpha inhibitors may be effective in reducing symptoms.
