# Genetic Information on Gene LRRC8A

## Gene Overview
LRRC8A stands for leucine-rich repeat-containing 8A and is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q34.11). This gene encodes a protein that is typically found in cell membranes and is involved in ion transport and cellular volume regulation.

## Gene Function
LRRC8A functions as a protein subunit for volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) that regulate cell volume and perform ion transport. Studies have shown that mutations on this gene can lead to altered ion transport, which in turn can contribute to certain pathologies.

- c.514C>T (rs370650210)
- c.269+1G>A (rs147642400)
- c.828+7A>G (rs375308154)

## Related Diseases
Studies have found associations between LRRC8A mutations and certain pathologies, including:
- Primary Immune Deficiency (PID)
- Oculodentodigital Dysplasia (ODDD)
- Lymphoma
- Glioblastoma
- Breast Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for LRRC8A mutations. However, new drugs that target LRRC8A function are being developed for possible future treatments. The prognosis for individuals with LRRC8A mutations varies depending on the severity of the pathology.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that the use of certain drugs, such as tamoxifen, can affect LRRC8A function and may have potential therapeutic value for certain cancers.
