## Gene: BMI1

### Genetic Position
BMI1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10p11.22).

### Pathology
BMI1 gene mutations or dysregulation have been linked to various cancers, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and glioblastoma.

### Function for Gene
BMI1 is a transcriptional repressor and plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal of stem cells. It also regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence.

### Related Disease
BMI1 gene mutations or dysregulation have been associated with various cancers, including:
- Breast cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Colon cancer
- Glioblastoma

### Treatment and Prognosis
The inhibition of BMI1 protein has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. The prognosis for patients with BMI1-positive tumors is usually poor.

### Drug Response
Several studies have shown that inhibiting BMI1 can enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in cancer treatment.
