## Gene LHX8
- **Function for gene:** LHX8 encodes for a protein that belongs to a family of LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factors. It is involved in regulating gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the development of the pituitary gland and teeth. It has also been shown to play a role in ovarian function and fertility.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** Not enough information available to provide this. 

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Not enough information available to provide this. 

- **Related disease:** Mutations in LHX8 have been linked to the development of hypodontia, a condition where teeth are congenitally missing. 

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Currently there is no cure for hypodontia, but treatment options include orthodontic treatment or dental implants to replace missing teeth. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition. 

- **Drug response:** Not enough information available to provide this.
