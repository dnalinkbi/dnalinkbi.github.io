## Gene Information for ACADVL

**Function for gene**: ACADVL (Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase, Very Long Chain) gene encodes an enzyme that plays a role in the breakdown of fatty acids to produce energy.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: 
- Gene ID: 37
- Genomic location: Chromosome 17 (17p11.2)
- Aliases: ACAD6, VLCAD

**External sites**: 
- HGNC: 139
- NCBI Entrez: 37
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108064
- OMIM: 201475
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P49748

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
- c.1504G>C (p.Gly502Arg) - rs28939075
- c.199T>C (p.Leu67Pro) - rs74315327
- c.193C>T (p.Arg65Cys) - rs74315326

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported.

**Related disease**: Mutations in the ACADVL gene have been linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder called very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD). Symptoms of VLCADD include hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, liver problems, and an increased susceptibility to infections.

**Treatment and prognosis**: Treatment for VLCADD involves maintaining a low-fat diet and avoiding fasting periods. Carnitine supplementation can also be used to help prevent hypoglycemia. Early diagnosis and treatment can help improve outcomes. However, some individuals with VLCADD may still experience significant health problems despite treatment.

**Drug response**: None reported specific to ACADVL mutations.
