## Gene MRPS16

### Genetic Position
- MRPS16 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14 (14p11.1).
- It spans approximately 8 kb and has 3 exons.

### Pathology
- Mutations in the MRPS16 gene are associated with Leigh Syndrome which is a rare neurodegenerative disorder.
- Leigh syndrome is characterized by symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia, brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum.

### Function
- The MRPS16 gene encodes a protein called Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S16 (MRP-S16).
- MRP-S16 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis within mitochondria.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for the MRPS16 gene.

### Related Diseases
- Leigh Syndrome (LS) - caused by mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding proteins that are essential for mitochondrial function.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for Leigh syndrome, and treatment is primarily supportive and symptomatic.
- The prognosis for Leigh syndrome is poor, and survival time varies widely both within and between genetic subtypes.

### Drug Response
- There are no specific drugs available to treat Leigh syndrome.
- However, certain medications and supplements such as thiamine, biotin, and creatine have been used with variable success in some cases.
