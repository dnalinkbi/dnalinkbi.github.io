# Information on gene IL7R

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- Gene: IL7R (Interleukin 7 Receptor)
- Chromosome: 5
- Locus: 5p13.2
- Pathology: Associated with decreased JAK1/STAT5 signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of immune system development and function. Mutations in IL7R have been linked to immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases.
- Function: The IL7R gene encodes a protein that is involved in the development and proliferation of immune cells, including T cells and B cells. It plays a role in the maintenance of T cell survival and in the formation and function of the immune system.

## External IDs, aliases and genomic location
- HGNC ID: 5976
- Entrez ID: 3575
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000168685
- OMIM ID: 146661
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P16871
- Aliases: CD127, ILRA, IL-7RA

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- rs3093904: Gln244Arg mutation (missense mutation)
- rs1494558: Pro259Ser mutation (missense mutation)
- rs1494555: Ala715Thr mutation (missense mutation)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are numerous SNVs and InDels that involve IL7R. Some examples include:
- rs9834447: C/T SNP in the intron region
- rs8566: T/C SNP in the promoter region
- rs12045481: C/G SNP in the 3'UTR region

## Related diseases
- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) 
- Autosomal recessive T-cell immunodeficiency
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment options vary depending on the specific disease associated with IL7R mutations. In cases of immunodeficiencies, bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy may be considered. In autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive therapy may be used.
- Prognosis also varies depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
- There is evidence to suggest that certain IL7R gene mutations may affect the response to certain immunosuppressive drugs, such as anti-TNF medications. However, further research is needed in this area.
