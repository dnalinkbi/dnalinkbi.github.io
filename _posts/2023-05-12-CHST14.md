## Gene: CHST14

### Genetic Position
- CHST14 is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position 15q26.3.

### Pathology
- Mutations in CHST14 are associated with a rare genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. 
- Individuals with CHST14 mutations exhibit musculoskeletal problems, skin problems, and other systemic features.

### Function
- CHST14 encodes an enzyme called dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase 1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate, a component of the extracellular matrix in various tissues.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID
- p.R283H, Missense Variant, rs41310297 
- p.R236C, Missense Variant, rs41309047
- p.R236H, Missense Variant, rs41309048

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in CHST14.

### Related Disease
- EDS (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for EDS is generally symptomatic and supportive, with a focus on managing complications and improving quality of life.
- Prognosis depends on the specific subtype of EDS and the severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response
- There is no known drug response associated with CHST14 mutations in individuals with EDS.
