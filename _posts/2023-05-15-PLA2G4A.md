## Information about Gene PLA2G4A

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic position:** The PLA2G4A gene is located on chromosome 1q25.2.
- **Pathology:** Variations in this gene have been associated with various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.
- **Function:** The PLA2G4A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cytosolic phospholipase A2-alpha (cPLA2-alpha). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the production of lipid mediators, which regulate various biological processes such as inflammation, cell growth, and cell death.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location

- **External IDs:** HGNC: 9060, NCBI Gene: 5321, Ensembl: ENSG00000159268, OMIM: 603473, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P47712
- **Aliases:** PLA2G4, cPLA2alpha, GXIIB
- **Genomic Location:** Chr1: 179,887,133-179,956,878

  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Alzheimer's disease
  - Parkinson's disease
  - Huntington's disease
  - Cardiovascular disease

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Currently, there are no specific treatments available for disorders associated with variations in the PLA2G4A gene. However, some treatments aimed at managing disease symptoms may be available.
- The prognosis for individuals with such disorders can vary widely, depending on the specific condition, its severity, and other factors.
