# Information about Gene F5

## Gene Position and Aliases

- Gene: F5
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: q23.2
- Alias: FACTOR V, FV

## Function of Gene

The F5 gene provides instructions for producing coagulation factor V. This protein plays a crucial role in blood clotting by helping to form a blood clot in response to injury.

## External IDs

- HGNC: 3537
- NCBI Entrez: 2153
- Ensembl: ENSG00000198743
- OMIM: 612309
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P12259

## Mutation

- AA Mutation: R506Q
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs6025

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

No reported somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified for the F5 gene.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the F5 gene can cause an increased risk of blood clots, a condition called thrombophilia. These genetic changes can cause excessive blood clotting, which can be harmful and lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for thrombophilia typically involves medications that help prevent blood clots. People with thrombophilia can lead normal and healthy lives as long as they receive treatment.

## Drug Response

Warfarin, an anticoagulant medication, is commonly used to treat thrombophilia and is often prescribed to individuals with a genetic mutation in the F5 gene.
