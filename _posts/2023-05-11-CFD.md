## Gene: CFD
- **Function:** CFD encodes for Complement factor D, a protein involved in the complement system which is a part of the immune system. CFD specifically activates complement factor B in the alternative pathway of the complement system, leading to the formation of the C3 convertase enzyme.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 1675
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 19q13.32
    - Aliases: Properdin factor D, adipsin, C3 convertase activator

    - HGNC: 4948
    - NCBI Entrez: 1675
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105256
    - OMIM: 138470
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P00746
- **AA Mutation List:**
    - p.Ile36Thr, rs16934672
    - p.Asp42His, rs12085427
    - p.Gly71Arg, rs12085428
    - p.Leu69Arg, rs10502591
- **Mutation type:** Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
    - None reported in dbSNP
- **Related Diseases:**
    - Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)
    - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
    - Complement factor D deficiency (CFDD)
- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - Treatment varies based on the severity of the disease resulting from CFDD. For ARMD and SLE, current treatment involves managing symptoms with immunosuppressive drugs or inhibitors of the complement system. For CFDD, treatment may involve plasma therapy or gene therapy.
- **Drug Response:**
    - Several drugs targeting complement factors have been approved or are in clinical trials, including eculizumab, ravulizumab, and coversin.
