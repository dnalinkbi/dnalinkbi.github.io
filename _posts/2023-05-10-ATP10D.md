## Gene ATP10D

- **Function:** ATP10D encodes for a transmembrane ATPase responsible for transporting cations across cellular membranes, specifically transporting cations like sodium, potassium, and magnesium out of the cell.

- **External IDs:** The gene ATP10D is located on chromosome 22 at the position 22q11.21. Other external IDs include:
    - Aliases: ATPX, ATPX1, ATPase, class V, type 10D

- **AA Mutation list:** Some of the known mutations in the ATP10D gene include:
    - p.Arg518Gly, rs73195988
    - p.Gln738His, rs78053192
    - p.Lys47Gln, rs146601908
    - p.Ile628Val, rs76899415
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** Currently no somatic SNVs/InDels are known for ATP10D gene.

- **Related disease:** Mutations in the ATP10D gene have been associated with several intellectual disability syndromes, including non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and Boerjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome. 

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there are no specific treatments for ATP10D gene mutations. Management of the associated intellectual disability syndromes is typically supportive and can include therapies like speech and occupational therapy, and educational support. Prognosis and life expectancy depend on the specific mutation and severity of intellectual disability.

- **Drug response:** No specific drug response is known for ATP10D gene mutations.
