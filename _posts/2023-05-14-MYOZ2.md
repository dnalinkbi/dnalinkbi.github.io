## Information on Gene MYOZ2

### Genetic Position
The MYOZ2 gene is found on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p23.1). It spans approximately 20.2 kb in length and is composed of 15 exons.

### Pathology
Mutations in MYOZ2 have been linked to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is characterized by ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function.

### Function
The MYOZ2 gene encodes a protein called myozenin 2, which is primarily expressed in cardiac muscle. Myozenin 2 is thought to play a role in the regulation of myofibrillar protein composition and may also be involved in the modulation of Ca2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations known to occur in MYOZ2 that have been linked to DCM:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|------------|--------|
|E57K|Missense|rs104894020|
|L122P|Missense|rs137854746|
|R221Q|Missense|rs137854747|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in MYOZ2.

### Related Disease
Mutations in MYOZ2 have been linked specifically to DCM, which is a progressive disease that can cause heart failure and may require a heart transplant.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for DCM typically involves medications to manage symptoms and improve heart function, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics. In some cases, surgery or a heart transplant may be necessary.

The prognosis for individuals with DCM varies depending on the severity of the disease and other factors. Patients with mild symptoms and good heart function may be able to manage the disease effectively with medication, while others with more severe symptoms or advanced disease may have a poorer prognosis and require more aggressive treatment.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on how specific drugs may affect individuals with MYOZ2 mutations.
