## Gene Information

**Gene:** MAPT (Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau)

**Function:** The MAPT gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in stabilizing microtubules in nerve cells. Microtubules help maintain the structural integrity of the cell, including the transport of nutrients and other materials to and from the cell body. Mutations in the MAPT gene have been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.

**Related Disease:** Mutations in the MAPT gene have been associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including:
- Alzheimer's disease
- Frontotemporal dementia
- Progressive supranuclear palsy
- Corticobasal degeneration

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for neurodegenerative disorders caused by MAPT mutations is currently limited and mostly supportive. The prognosis for these disorders is generally poor, with progressive cognitive and motor decline leading to eventual disability and often premature death.

**Drug Response:** There is currently no drug specifically targeting MAPT mutations. However, some drugs used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders may provide symptomatic relief in patients with MAPT mutations.
