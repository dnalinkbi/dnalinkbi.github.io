## Gene ABL2

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1 (1q25.2)

**Pathology:** ABL2 gene is involved in the development of several cancers including acute lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, as well as non-cancerous disorders such as hypertension, stroke, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

**Function:** The ABL2 gene encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and migration.

**Externals IDs, Aliases and Genomic locations:**

- HGNC ID: 77
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 27
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000143378
- OMIM ID: 164690
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P00519
- Aliases: ARG, ABLL, JTK12, STLS, RP11-317H9.2

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

- p.Arg171Cys (rs117816136)
- p.Leu261Phe (rs28933393)
- p.Ile290Phe (rs146838974)

- p.Val400Leu (rs150906443)
- p.Gly441Arg (rs137853467)
- p.Thr492Ile (rs34324305)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

- c.510T>C (rs1420221418)
- c.1516A>G (rs754478001)
- c.760G>A (rs201730603)

**Related Diseases:** 

- Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
- Hypertension 
- Stroke
- Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis of ABL2-associated diseases depend on the specific disease. In some cases, such as CML, tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib are used to target the abnormal ABL2 kinase activity. In other cases, like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, there is currently no cure, and treatment options aim to slow the progression of the disease.

**Drug Response:** ABL2 kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, are used to target the abnormal kinase activity in CML, and have shown significant success in treating the disease.
