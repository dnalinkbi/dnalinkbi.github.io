# Information about gene SLC5A7

## Genetic Position
SLC5A7 is located on chromosome 2q12.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SLC5A7 gene are associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), which is a group of inherited disorders that affect neuromuscular transmission.

## Function
SLC5A7 encodes a protein called the choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1), which is responsible for transporting choline into the nerve terminal for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The following are some of the reported AA mutations in SLC5A7 gene with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | -------------| -------- |
| G50R        | Missense     | rs141155445 |
| G53C        | Missense     | rs869025746 |
| R97P        | Missense     | rs121912937 |
| V158A       | Missense     | rs201107234 |
| L244V       | Missense     | rs772300840 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the SLC5A7 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in SLC5A7 are associated with several subtypes of CMS, including CMS associated with episodic apnea, CMS with tubular aggregates, and slow-channel CMS.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of CMS caused by mutations in SLC5A7 typically involves cholinesterase inhibitors, which help to increase the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.

The long-term prognosis for CMS caused by SLC5A7 mutations varies depending on the specific subtype and severity of the disorder.

## Drug Response
Patients with CMS caused by mutations in SLC5A7 typically respond well to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, although the response may be variable depending on the specific mutation and subtype of CMS.
