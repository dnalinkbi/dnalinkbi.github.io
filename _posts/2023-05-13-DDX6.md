# Gene Information for DDX6

## Gene Overview
DDX6 (DEAD-box helicase 6) is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This gene is present on chromosome 11 and encodes a 438 amino acid protein. It is highly conserved across various species and is expressed in all tissues. DDX6 has several functions, including RNA helicase activity, mRNA decapping, and translational repression.
