# Gene Information for KIR2DL3

## Gene Function
KIR2DL3 is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family that encodes glycoproteins that recognize and bind major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, allowing natural killer (NK) cells to differentiate between healthy cells and cells that should be targeted for immunological destruction.
