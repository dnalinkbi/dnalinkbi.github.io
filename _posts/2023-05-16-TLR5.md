# Gene TLR5

### Gene information
- **Function**: This gene encodes a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. The encoded protein is a receptor for bacterial flagellin, which is a principal component of bacterial flagella and acts as a potent activator of the innate immune system.

- **External IDs**: HGNC: TL5; Entrez Gene: 7100; Ensembl: ENSG00000105755; OMIM: 603031; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60602.
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 1: 117,058,525-117,060,152.

- **Aliases**: Toll-like receptor 5, TIL3, CD185 antigen



### Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
  - p.Arg392His (rs5744168)
  - p.Asn429Ser (rs2072493)
  - p.Val576Ala (rs5744167)

### Somatic mutations
- No significant somatic mutations have been reported yet.

### Related diseases
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Cancer

### Treatment and prognosis
- No direct treatment or prognosis related to the TLR5 gene is available yet. However, TLR5 agonists are suggested as adjuvants for anticancer immunotherapy.

### Drug response
- CPG 7909, which targets TLR9, with the combination of a TLR5 agonist is in the development stage for cancer immunotherapy.
