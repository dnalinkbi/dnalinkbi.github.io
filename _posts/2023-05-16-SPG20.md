## Gene Information

**Gene Name:** SPG20

**Function:** The SPG20 gene encodes a protein called spartin which is involved in several cellular processes including protein trafficking and degradation, lipid metabolism, and cytokinesis.

**External IDs:** HGNC: 11204, Entrez Gene: 23111, Ensembl: ENSG00000179271, OMIM: 610145, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NZD8

**Aliases:** Troyer syndrome protein, FSP4, SPG20-isoform1, Spartin

## Mutations

**AA mutations:**

|Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|-------------|--------|
|p.R352X|nonsense|rs137853342|
|p.R324Q|missense|rs124759484|

|p.G452E|missense|rs121434420|
|p.G434V|missense|rs76515508|

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:**

No somatic mutations have been reported for SPG20 in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the SPG20 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders including:

- Troyer syndrome (also known as hereditary spastic paraplegia type 20)
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B2
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments for SPG20-associated disorders. Patients are typically managed with physical therapy, medications for spasticity and pain, and orthopedic interventions as needed. 

Prognosis varies depending on the severity and type of disorder, but many patients experience progressive motor impairment and disability.

## Drug Response

There is currently no information on drug response for SPG20-associated disorders.
