## Information about gene CREB3L3
### Genetic position, Pathology, and Function
Gene: CREB3L3 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 3) <br>
Chromosome: 11 <br>
Location: 11q13.2 <br>
Aliases: OASIS, CREB-H <br>

**Function**: CREB3L3 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and protein secretion. It has a critical role in liver and adipose tissue metabolism, as well as immune response.
