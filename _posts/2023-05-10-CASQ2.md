# Information about gene CASQ2

### Genetic Position
The CASQ2 gene is located on chromosome 1 at position q21.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been linked to Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT), a rare inherited cardiac disorder characterized by an abnormal heart rhythm in response to physical or emotional stress.

### Function
The CASQ2 gene encodes for the calsequestrin-2 protein which plays an important role in regulating calcium homeostasis within cardiac muscle cells.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for CASQ2.

### Related Diseases
- Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for CPVT includes beta blocker drugs, implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and lifestyle modifications to avoid triggers that can cause episodes. Prognosis for CPVT patients varies, with some patients experiencing frequent episodes of arrhythmia and others being asymptomatic.

### Drug Response
One study found that CASQ2 mutation carriers with CPVT had a positive response to flecainide, a sodium channel blocker.
