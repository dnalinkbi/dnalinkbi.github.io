# Gene Information: ASIC3

## Genetic Position:
The ASIC3 gene is located on chromosome 7 at position q36.2 and contains 12 exons. 

## Pathology:
The ASIC3 gene has been implicated in various pain-related disorders, including migraine, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis. 

## Function:
The ASIC3 gene encodes for acid-sensing ion channels, which are important for sensing and responding to acidic environments. Specifically, ASIC3 is involved in pain perception and is found in sensory neurons that respond to noxious stimuli. 

## External IDs and Aliases:
- Entrez Gene: 9312
- HGNC: 179
- Ensembl: ENSG00000106512
- OMIM: 605849
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UHC3
- Aliases: ACCN3, TNaC1, hbnpc, brain sodium channel 1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several known mutations in the ASIC3 gene, including:
- R478W (rs12429015): This is a missense mutation that has been associated with migraine with aura. 
- P369S (rs56256216): This is another missense mutation that has been linked to increased pain sensitivity in individuals with osteoarthritis. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There is limited information on somatic mutations in the ASIC3 gene.

## Related Disease:
ASIC3 gene mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with several pain-related disorders, including:
- Migraine with aura
- Fibromyalgia
- Osteoarthritis

## Treatment and Prognosis:
Current treatments for pain-related disorders associated with ASIC3 mutations are based on symptom management and may include analgesics, physical therapy, or alternative therapies such as acupuncture. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and individual factors.

## Drug Response:
ASIC3-targeted drugs are currently being developed for the treatment of pain. One example is APETx2, a peptide toxin that selectively inhibits ASIC3 channels.
