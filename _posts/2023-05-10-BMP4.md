# Information about gene BMP4

## Genetic Position

BMP4 gene is located on chromosome 14q22-q23.

## Pathology

Mutations in BMP4 gene have been linked to different types of diseases such as developmental malformations, congenital heart diseases, and cancer.

## Function

The BMP4 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. The protein is involved in the regulation of embryonic development, cell differentiation, and proliferation.
