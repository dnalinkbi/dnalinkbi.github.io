# Gene: TBL1X 

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome X: 154,703,039-154,898,233

**Function for Gene:** TBL1X encodes a protein that is part of a transcriptional coregulator complex involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) complex, which plays a role in diverse biological processes including development, differentiation, and homeostasis.
