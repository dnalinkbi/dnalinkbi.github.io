# Gene PRPH

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 12 (12q13.13)
- **Function:** The PRPH gene encodes for the protein Peripherin, which is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments in various types of cells, including neurons and glial cells.
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the PRPH gene have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
- **Aliases:** PRPH2, RDS, RP7, CMS1E, CORD7, EVR4, NR2E3-associated dominant macular degeneration

## Identifiers 
- **Gene ID:** 8614
- **Genomic location:** NC_000012.12 (g.55644799_55667903)
- **HGNC ID:** 9407
- **NCBI Entrez:** [8614](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8614))
- **Ensembl Gene:** [ENSG00000173502](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000173502;r=12:55644799-55667903))

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=PRPH%5Bgene%5D)) has a list of known mutations in the PRPH gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations.
- **Mutation type:** Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (InDels)
- **dbSNP ID:** [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs35354618)) has several SNPs listed for the PRPH gene.

## Related Diseases
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT)
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
- Autosomal Dominant Macular Dystrophy

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for PRPH-related disorders are limited. Physical therapy and mobility aids may be recommended for CMT patients. ALS patients may benefit from medication to manage symptoms such as muscle stiffness and cramping, as well as respiratory support in advanced stages.
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no targeted drug therapy for PRPH-related disorders.
