# Gene Information for SCGB3A2

## General Information
- Gene Name: Secretoglobin Family 3A Member 2 (SCGB3A2)
- Genomic Position: Chromosome 11: 77,458,735-77,462,424
- Aliases: HIN-1, HIN1, SCC-S2

## Function
SCGB3A2 is a secreted protein and a member of the secretoglobin family. It is primarily expressed in the respiratory tract. Its exact function is not yet fully understood, although it is believed to play a role in the regulation of inflammation in the airway and lung. SCGB3A2 is also considered a potential tumor suppressor gene.

## Related Diseases
SCGB3A2 has been implicated in several diseases, including:
- Lung Cancer
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
- Asthma
- Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia

## Treatment and Prognosis
As SCGB3A2 is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene, there is ongoing research into its role in cancer therapy. However, there are currently no specific treatments or prognostic indicators based on SCGB3A2 expression.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs currently approved for targeting SCGB3A2.
