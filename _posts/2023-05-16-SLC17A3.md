# Gene: SLC17A3

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 6 (NC_000006.12) at 6q22.31
- **Pathology:** No specific association with any disease
- **Function:** Encodes a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter protein that is expressed in the kidney and is responsible for the reabsorption of inorganic phosphate in the renal tubules.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several mutations reported in the SLC17A3 gene. Some of the important ones are:
    - Phe540Leu (missense) rs121908191
    - Trp620Ter (nonsense) rs121908192
    - Arg663Cys (missense) rs777439961
    
## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations are reported in SLC17A3 gene.

## Related Disease
- Mutations in SLC17A3 gene have been associated with:
    - Familial idiopathic hypercalciuria
    - Proximal renal tubular acidosis
    - Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Depending on the underlying cause of the disease related to SLC17A3 mutation, treatment and prognosis may vary. 
- Familial idiopathic hypercalciuria can be treated with a low-salt diet and thiazide diuretics. 
- In case of proximal renal tubular acidosis, treatment includes bicarbonate supplementation and sodium citrate.
- Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria has no definitive cure yet, but some treatments focus on correcting mineral imbalances and bone mineralization.

## Drug Response
- No specific drug targeting has been reported for SLC17A3 gene.
