# Gene: F13A1

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 6,23.8 - 23.84Mb
- **Pathology:** Gamma-fibrin stabilizing factor deficiency
- **Function:** Encodes for Factor XIII-A, a clot-stabilizing factor involved in blood coagulation
- **Aliases:** FXIIIA, F13A

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- None reported

## Related diseases

- Congenital factor XIII deficiency
- Acquired factor XIII deficiency

## Treatment and prognosis

- Currently, there is no cure for factor XIII deficiency
- Treatment involves administration of clotting factor concentrates containing factor XIII
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the deficiency and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug response

- Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to decrease thrombin activation and clot formation in patients with congenital factor XIII deficiency
