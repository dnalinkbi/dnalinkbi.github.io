## Gene Name: MYOT

### Function:
MYOT gene encodes for myotilin protein, a component of the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. This protein interacts with other proteins of the sarcomere to maintain the structural integrity of muscle fibers.

- Myopathy, myofibrillar, 1 (MFM1)
- Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A (LGMD1A)

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Currently, there is no cure for MYOT-related muscular dystrophies. However, treatment is recommended to manage symptoms and improve the quality of life of affected individuals. Physical therapy, orthoses, and mobility aids may be used to maintain muscle strength and function.

### Drug Response:
No specific drug response has been reported yet for MYOT-related muscular dystrophies.
