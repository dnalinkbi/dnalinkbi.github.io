# Gene SLC25A19

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
SLC25A19 is a gene located on chromosome 17q25.1 that encodes a protein named "Mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier." It plays a vital role in the import of thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria. Mutations in the SLC25A19 gene are associated with Amish lethal microcephaly, which is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by microcephaly and insufficient thiamine pyrophosphate transport into the mitochondria.

## Gene Function
The SLC25A19 gene encodes a protein that acts as a mitochondrial carrier. It facilitates the import of thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria, which is required for the proper functioning of several mitochondrial enzymes, particularly those involved in the Krebs cycle.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the SLC25A19 gene are associated with Amish lethal microcephaly, which is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by microcephaly, progressive psychomotor retardation, and seizures. Affected individuals usually die within the first few months of life.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Amish lethal microcephaly. Treatment is supportive, and it focuses on managing the symptoms. The prognosis is poor, and affected individuals usually die within the first few months of life.

## Drug Response
No drug response associated with SLC25A19 gene mutations have been reported.
