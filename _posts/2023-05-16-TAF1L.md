### Function
TAF1L (TAF1 RNA polymerase II, TATA box binding protein associated factor) is a subunit of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is involved in the initiation of gene transcription. It plays a crucial role in the recruitment of TFIID to the promoter region of target genes.
