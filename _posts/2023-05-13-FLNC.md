## Gene FLNC

**Function:** The FLNC gene encodes for the protein filamin C which is mainly expressed in striated muscles and is involved in the organization and maintenance of the sarcomere. It is involved in various cellular processes including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cytoskeleton remodeling.

**Related diseases:** FLNC mutations have been associated with various muscle disorders including myofibrillar myopathy, myopathy with exercise intolerance, and distal myopathies.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for FLNC-related muscle disorders is largely supportive and symptomatic, and may include physical therapy, respiratory support, and cardiac monitoring.

**Drug response:** There is no known drug specifically targeting FLNC-related muscle disorders.
