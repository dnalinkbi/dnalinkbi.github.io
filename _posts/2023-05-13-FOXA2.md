# Gene FOXA2

## Genetic Position
The FOXA2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.12).

## Pathology
Mutations in the FOXA2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cancer.

## Function
FOXA2 encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the pancreas, liver, and lungs. It is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, and lipid metabolism.
