# Information about Gene PCOLCE

## Genetic Position
- Location: Chromosome 7 (7q22.1)
- Start position: 100,335,896 bp
- End position: 100,349,931 bp

## Pathology
PCOLCE (Procollagen C-Endopeptidase Enhancer) gene plays a role in the modification and processing of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

## Function
PCOLCE encodes a glycoprotein which enhances the activity of procollagen C-endopeptidase, a metalloprotease enzyme involved in the processing of pro-collagen molecules during collagen synthesis.

- c.347T>C (p.Cys116Arg); rs369880927
- c.389G>A (p.Cys130Tyr); rs772036503

## Related Disease
- Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)
- Stickler syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for OI and EDS is mainly supportive and includes surgical and medical interventions to address symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug designed specifically for the treatment of OI and EDS. However, bisphosphonates have been used in some patients with OI to increase bone density and reduce the frequency of fractures.
