# Information about gene IL12RB2
 
## Gene Position 
The IL12RB2 (Interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta-2) gene is located on chromosome 1p31.3.
 
## Pathology 
Mutations in IL12RB2 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections, and autoimmune diseases. Deficiency of IL12RB2 causes Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the increased susceptibility to infections caused by relatively weakly virulent mycobacterial species such as bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine and environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria.
 
## Function
IL12RB2 gene encodes a subunit of the interleukin 12 (IL-12) receptor. IL-12 is a cytokine that is produced in response to antigenic stimulation, it plays a crucial role in the immune response by activating Natural Killer (NK) cells and T helper-1 cells, both of which are important in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. The encoded protein is a type I transmembrane protein that is involved in signal transduction and formation of the interleukin 12 receptor.

## Related Disease
- Susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, autosomal recessive 2 (OMIM# 605129).
- Immunodeficiency 30 (OMIM# 614891).
 
## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of IL12RB2 mutations involves antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral therapies, particularly in the case of mycobacterial infections. Normally, these infections are treated with antibiotics such as rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide. In some cases, bone marrow transplant has also been used to treat these patients. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the infection and extent of damage caused.
 
## Drug Response
Studies have shown that anti-TB drugs such as Rifampicin act as transcriptional activators of the IL12RB2 gene in human monocytes. This indicates that IL12RB2 gene may play a key role in the anti-TB immune response.
