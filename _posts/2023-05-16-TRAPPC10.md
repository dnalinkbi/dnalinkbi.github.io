# Information about Gene TRAPPC10

## Genetic Position and Genomic Information

- Gene: TRAPPC10
- Location: Chromosome 17q21.31
- Aliases: D17Wsu52e, CGI-20, FLJ10708, MGC51817

## Function

The TRAPPC10 gene encodes a subunit of the trafficking protein particle (TRAPP) complex, which is involved in intracellular vesicle transport. Specifically, TRAPPC10 is a component of the TRAPP-II complex that is responsible for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000108825
- OMIM: 613458
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H4I5

## Mutations

- AA Mutation List: Several missense mutations have been identified in TRAPPC10, including: 
    - p.Asp184Asn
    - p.Glu29Lys
    - p.Val501Met
- Mutation Type: Missense mutations
- dbSNP ID: rs201727760, rs777472162, rs886040891

## Somatic SNVs/InDels

There are no somatic mutations reported for TRAPPC10 in COSMIC or other databases.

## Related Diseases

There are no diseases directly associated with TRAPPC10 mutations. However, abnormalities in the TRAPP complex have been implicated in a variety of human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

As there are no known diseases directly caused by mutations in TRAPPC10, there are currently no specific treatments or prognoses associated with this gene.

## Drug Response

The role of TRAPPC10 in intracellular vesicle transport suggests that it may play a role in the efficacy of certain drugs that rely on this transport system. Further research is needed to determine the specific relationship between TRAPPC10 and drug response.
