# Information about Gene GYPE

## Genetic Position
The GYPE gene is located on chromosome 4q28.3, specifically at the coordinates 139,322,582-139,338,806.

## Pathology
The GYPE gene codes for a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein called glycophorin E, which is primarily expressed in erythrocytes. Mutations in the GYPE gene have been linked to various blood-related disorders, including hereditary elliptocytosis and glycophorin E-deficient blood types.

## Function
Glycophorin E serves as a receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, allowing it to invade erythrocytes. It also plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of erythrocyte membranes.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic variants in GYPE.

## Related Disease
Mutations in GYPE have been found to cause various blood-related disorders, including:
- Hereditary Elliptocytosis 2 (OMIM: 617986)
- CO4B-deficient Blood Group (OMIM: 613697)
- Dantu Blood Group (OMIM: 110800)
- Leach Phenomenon Blood Group (OMIM: 111300)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for blood-related disorders caused by mutations in GYPE may involve blood transfusions or, in some cases, bone marrow transplantation. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and its severity.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in GYPE.
