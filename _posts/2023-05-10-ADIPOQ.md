## Gene Information for ADIPOQ

### Genomic location, Aliases, and External IDs

- ADIPOQ stands for Adiponectin
- Genomic location: Chromosome 3 (3q27.3)
- Aliases: ACDC, ACRP30, ADPN
- External IDs:
  - HGNC: 133
  - NCBI Entrez: 9370
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000181092
  - OMIM: 605441
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15848
  
### Function for Gene

- The ADIPOQ gene encodes adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue.
- Adiponectin plays a role in regulating glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation.
- It also has anti-inflammatory effects and influences insulin sensitivity.
- Adiponectin has been linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic disorders.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- rs17300539: p.Gly90Arg (missense mutation)
- rs17366743: p.Gln84Arg (missense mutation)
- rs266729: p.Met70Leu (missense mutation)
- rs822395: p.Ser164Ser (synonymous mutation)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- rs3745367 (not listed as somatic but reported in cancer samples)

### Related Disease

- Obesity
- Type 2 diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome
- Cardiovascular disease
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise can improve adiponectin levels and sensitivity to the hormone.
- Some medications, such as thiazolidinediones, have been shown to increase adiponectin levels.
- Low levels of adiponectin have been associated with worse outcomes in certain diseases.

### Drug Response

- No drugs have been specifically approved to target adiponectin levels, but some medications can indirectly affect its expression.
