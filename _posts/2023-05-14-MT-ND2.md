## Gene MT-ND2

**Genetic Position**: MT-ND2 is located at mitochondrial DNA position 4,587-5,757.

**Function**: MT-ND2 gene encodes for a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) which is involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain and energy generation through oxidative phosphorylation.

**External IDs and Aliases**:
- HGNC:7456
- NCBI Entrez: 4535
- Ensembl: ENSG00000198786
- OMIM: 516003
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P03891

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**:
Some of the missense mutations in MT-ND2 gene reported in various databases with their effect and dbSNP ID are as follows:
- p.R21L - disease causing, rs267606793
- p.V116I - non-pathogenic, rs28358380
- p.R117H - disease causing, rs28933401
- p.M237I - non-pathogenic, rs28358387

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
NCBI's dbSNP database reports several somatic variants in MT-ND2 gene associated with various cancers or tumors. Few of them are listed below:
- rs1558857878 - lung adenocarcinoma
- rs119491332 - breast cancer
- rs1552469571 - pancreas adenocarcinoma

**Related Disease**: Mutations in MT-ND2 gene are associated with mitochondrial diseases, particularly Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) which is a rare genetic disorder causing vision loss.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Currently, there is no cure for LHON and treatement options are limited to symptomatic management and optic nerve protection. Prognosis varies depending on the age of onset and severity of the disease.

**Drug Response**: There are no known drugs that specifically target MT-ND2 gene mutations. However, some drugs such as idebenone and vitamin B3 have shown potential in clinical trials to improve vision and mitochondrial function in some LHON patients.
