## Information about Gene KCNT1

KCNT1 (Potassium Channel, Sodium Activated Subfamily T Member 1) is a gene located on the 9q34.3 position of chromosome 9. It encodes for a protein that belongs to the subfamily of sodium-activated potassium channels.

### Function for gene
The protein encoded by this gene is a voltage-gated ion channel that plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability. Its function is to control the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane, thereby affecting the cell's electrical activity.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several amino acid mutations have been reported in the KCNT1 gene. Some of them are:
- p.Val995Met (rs1553077037)
- p.Arg398Trp (rs746203656)
- p.Arg398Gln (rs1553077023)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are somatic variants reported in the KCNT1 gene in COSMIC database with dbSNP ID. One of the examples is:
- c.3299C>T (p.Arg1100Cys) (COSM1481362)

### Related disease
Mutations in the KCNT1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. These disorders are collectively known as KCNT1-related disorders or Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 14 (EIEE14).

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no cure for KCNT1-related disorders. Treatment usually involves antiepileptic drugs, but response to treatment is variable. Prognosis is also dependent on individual cases.

### Drug response
Patients with KCNT1 mutations may respond differently to antiepileptic drugs. Some studies have suggested that the sodium channel blocker lamotrigine may be a potential therapeutic option for some patients. However, further research is needed to establish its efficacy.
