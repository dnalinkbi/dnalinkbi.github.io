## Gene: ABCG8

### 1. Function
ABCG8 (ATP-binding cassette transporter G8) is a protein-coding gene that encodes a member of ABC (ATP-binding Cassette) transporter family. This protein specifically transports sterols, mainly plant sterols, from the small intestine and liver to the intestinal lumen and bile, respectively. ABCG8 functions along with ABCG5 to control the sterol absorption and excretion. Mutations or defects in ABCG8 are linked with several disorders related to sterol imbalance, including hypercholesterolemia and gallstone disease.

- p.Tyr54Cys (rs11887536)
- p.Asp19His (rs143098058)
- p.Tyr54Ser (rs1434537)

### 4. Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for ABCG8 in dbSNP.

### 5. Related disease
ABCG8 mutations or defects are associated with several disorders, including:
- Sitosterolemia (OMIM: 210250)
- Gallstone disease (OMIM: 600803)
- Hypercholesterolemia

### 6. Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disorder and the severity of the symptoms. Patients with sitosterolemia require a low-sterol diet and medication to regulate cholesterol levels. Gallstone disease can be treated with surgery. There is no definitive cure for hypercholesterolemia; however, lifestyle changes, medication, and dietary changes help in controlling cholesterol levels.

### 7. Drug response
Some medications such as Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) inhibitors and ezetimibe have been found to effectively reduce the absorption of cholesterol and plant sterols in patients with sitosterolemia.
