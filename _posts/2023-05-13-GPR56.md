# Information about Gene GPR56

## Genetic Position
- The gene GPR56 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q12.1).

## Pathology
- Mutations in the GPR56 gene have been linked to a number of disorders, including:
  - Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP)
  - Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
  - Cerebral arteriopathy and cerebral hemorrhage (CA-CH)
  
## Function
- The GPR56 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a role in cell adhesion and migration. It is involved in the development and maintenance of multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs.
