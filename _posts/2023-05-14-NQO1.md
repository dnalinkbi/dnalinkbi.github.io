# Gene: NQO1

## Genetic Position
The NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) gene is located on chromosome 16q22.1, consisting of 6 exons and 5 introns.

## Pathology and Function
NQO1 plays a critical role in detoxification, as it protects cells from oxidative stress by catalyzing the conversion of toxic quinones to hydroquinones. This enzyme also has a role in stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53. Loss of function or reduced activity of NQO1 has been associated with increased risk of various types of cancer, such as lung, colon, and breast cancer.

## Related Disease
Reduced activity of NQO1 is associated with an increased risk of cancer, such as lung, colon, and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no drugs or treatments specifically targeting NQO1. The prognosis for cancer patients with reduced NQO1 activity may vary depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug Response
NQO1 is involved in the bioactivation of certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitomycin C and CB1954. However, the effectiveness of these drugs may be limited in individuals with reduced NQO1 activity.
