## Gene NFIA 

### Genetic position 
- Located on chromosome 1p31.3
- Position: 191,477,664-191,779,535

### Pathology and function
- NFIA gene codes for a transcription factor that plays an important role in the development of the nervous system, the kidneys, and the lungs.
- Diseases associated with NFIA mutations include:
    - Schizencephaly (OMIM: 269160)
    - Coffin-Siris syndrome 5 (OMIM: 616938)
    - Brain malformations with urinary tract defects (OMIM: 615802)
- NFIA is also involved in the development of glioblastoma.
