## Gene Information
The ALDH1A1 gene encodes a protein called aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1. This protein is involved in the oxidation of aldehydes and is important in the synthesis of retinoic acid and other aldehyde-containing compounds.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently 4 somatic mutations recorded in the COSMIC database for the ALDH1A1 gene. The dbSNP IDs are not available for these mutations.

## Related Disease
The ALDH1A1 gene has been implicated in several diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Sj√∂gren-Larsson syndrome. Dysregulation of ALDH1A1 expression has been observed in several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, liver, and lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments targeting the ALDH1A1 gene. However, several studies have suggested that inhibition of ALDH1A1 activity may have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.

## Drug Response
ALDH1A1 activity has been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in cancer patients. Several compounds such as disulfiram have been investigated as potential inhibitors of ALDH1A1 activity in cancer therapy.
