# Gene MLC1

## Genetic Position
The gene MLC1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q13.33).

## Pathology
Mutations in the MLC1 gene are associated with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive motor impairment, epilepsy, and ataxia. MLC is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the MLC1 or the GLIALCAM gene. 

## Function
The MLC1 gene encodes a protein called MLC1, which is a membrane protein expressed in the brain, particularly in astrocytes. The exact function of this protein is still not fully understood, but studies suggest that it may be involved in ion channel regulation, cell signaling, and membrane trafficking.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic SNVs/InDels in the MLC1 gene listed in the COSMIC database. Here are a few examples with their dbSNP IDs:

- c.1483A>G (rs61750565)
- c.1720C>G (rs147169334)

## Related Disease
Mutations in the MLC1 gene are associated with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive motor impairment, epilepsy, and ataxia.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for MLC, and treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of symptoms and the age at which they appear.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeted towards treating MLC. Symptomatic treatment, such as antiepileptic drugs, may be used to manage symptoms.
