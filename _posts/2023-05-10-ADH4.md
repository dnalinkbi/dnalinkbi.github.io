## Gene: ADH4

ADH4 is a gene that encodes for the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 4. It is located on chromosome 4q23 and is primarily expressed in the liver and stomach tissue. 

### Function:
The ADH4 enzyme is involved in the metabolism of alcohol. It catalyzes the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, which is further metabolized to acetate by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. 

### External IDs and aliases:
- HGNC: 246
- NCBI Entrez: 126
- Ensembl: ENSG00000121903
- OMIM: 103730
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08319
- Aliases: ADH-PI, ADH4, HEL-S-141

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are several known SNPs in the ADH4 gene that can lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Some of these SNPs and their dbSNP IDs include:
- rs1126671: Arg48His
- rs4147536: Thr71Ala
- rs1800759: His147Asp
- rs1800762: Arg272Gln

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are several somatic mutations, including SNVs and InDels, that have been identified in the ADH4 gene. Some of these and their associated dbSNP IDs include:

| Mutation           | dbSNP ID     |
|--------------------|--------------|
| c.212C>A           | rs368143251  |
| c.466C>T           | rs368126859  |
| c.632G>A           | rs200430848  |

### Related diseases:
Genetic variations in the ADH4 gene have been associated with alcoholism and the risk of certain cancers, such as gastric cancer and head and neck cancers.

### Treatment and prognosis:
There is currently no specific treatment for genetic variations in the ADH4 gene. However, individuals with a higher risk of alcoholism or certain cancers may benefit from preventative measures, such as avoiding alcohol or practicing healthy lifestyle habits.

### Drug response:
Variations in the ADH4 gene can influence an individual's response to alcohol and certain medications.
