# Gene TAZ

## Genetic Position
The gene TAZ is located on the X chromosome at the position Xq23.

## Pathology
Mutations in the TAZ gene can cause Barth syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males. This syndrome is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, growth delay, and neutropenia.

## Function
The TAZ gene provides instructions for making a protein called tafazzin. This protein is involved in the normal functioning of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Tafazzin helps modify certain fats called phospholipids, which are important components of the mitochondrial membrane.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID for TAZ gene.

## Related Disease
Barth syndrome is the related disease caused by TAZ gene mutations.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Barth syndrome. Treatment involves managing symptoms and complications associated with the condition. Prognosis varies based on the individual case and severity of the symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug or therapy currently available for Barth syndrome. Management is usually focused on reducing symptoms, and can include medications to improve heart function, growth factors to address growth delay, and antibiotics to address infections.
