## Gene information for MYOC

### Gene Function
MYOC (Myocilin) encodes a protein that is part of the extracellular matrix in the eye. It plays a role in the regulation of intraocular pressure and glaucoma related pathology.

### External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 4653
- Genomic location: Chr1: 111,857,940-111,869,381
- Alias: GLC1A, JOAG1, TIGR

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gln368Ter - nonsense mutation with rs1800401
- p.Gln368Arg - missense mutation with rs74315329
- p.Tyr453Asn - missense mutation with rs28936679
- p.Gln368His - missense mutation with rs201500625
- p.Ala445Val - missense mutation with rs104893916

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels for MYOC.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in MYOC are associated with various forms of glaucoma including primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG).

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis for individuals with MYOC-associated glaucoma varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease. Therapeutic interventions can include medications to lower intraocular pressure and in some cases, surgery.

### Drug Response
There is evidence to suggest that MYOC genotype can impact drug response to various glaucoma medications such as prostaglandin analogues.
