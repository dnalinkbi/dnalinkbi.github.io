## Information about Gene CTF1

### Genetic Position
The gene CTF1, also known as Cardiotrophin 1, is located on the chromosome 16 at the position 16p11.2.

### Pathology
Studies have shown that CTF1 is associated with cardiomyopathy, heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. It has been found that a decrease in CTF1 expression can lead to cardiac dysfunction.

### Function
The CTF1 gene codes for a protein called Cardiotrophin-1 that belongs to the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and can also act as an anti-inflammatory agent.

- rs142435388
- rs146457300
- rs149502920

### Related Disease
Studies have shown that CTF1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure and associated cardiac disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment available for CTF1-related disorders. However, there are ongoing research studies to develop therapeutic interventions that target this gene.

### Drug Response
Studies have shown that certain drugs like carvedilol and bisoprolol can increase the expression of CTF1 gene, which can help in the treatment of heart failure.
