# Genetic Information for Gene THBD

## Gene Information
- Gene: THBD (Thrombomodulin)
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 11892
    - NCBI Entrez: 7056
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000117525
    - OMIM: 188040
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07204
- Aliases: BDCA3, THRM

## Gene Function
The THBD gene encodes for a protein called thrombomodulin that is found in endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Thrombomodulin is involved in blood coagulation regulation by binding to thrombin, reducing the production of fibrin, and activating protein C.

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Location: p11.21

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: Several missense mutations have been reported in THBD gene (p.Leu25Val, p.Arg82Cys, p.Arg84Leu, p.Arg178Gln, p.Arg389His, p.Arg457Cys, p.Arg464His, and p.Arg457del). 
- Mutation type: missense, deletion
- dbSNP IDs: rs1042579, rs3742207, rs3733402, rs3733401, rs764382407

## Somatic Mutations
Several somatic mutations have been reported in THBD gene in various studies. However, no specific mutation has been identified as a significant driver for any particular disease or condition.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in THBD gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Thrombophilia due to thrombomodulin defect
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
- Kawasaki disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of diseases associated with THBD gene mutations vary depending on the disease.

## Drug Response
No specific drug response has been identified for THBD gene mutations.
