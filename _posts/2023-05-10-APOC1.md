## Information about gene APOC1

### Genetic Position
The APOC1 gene is located on chromosome 19 at position p13.2. 

### Pathology
The APOC1 gene has been associated with various pathological conditions. Increased expression of this gene has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. Variations in this gene have also been associated with lipid metabolism disorders such as high-density lipoprotein deficiency and hyperlipoproteinemia. 

### Function
The APOC1 gene encodes a protein known as apolipoprotein C-1, which plays a role in lipid metabolism. This protein is involved in the transport of lipids, particularly triglycerides and cholesterol, in the bloodstream. It is also involved in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism.

- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P02654

### AA Mutation List
The following are some of the amino acid mutations associated with APOC1 gene variations:
- L9P with dbSNP ID rs41274739
- P20T with dbSNP ID rs11591147
- C17Y with dbSNP ID rs147172087
- R48C with dbSNP ID rs76945038

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels associated with the APOC1 gene.

### Related Disease
Variations in the APOC1 gene have been associated with various pathological conditions, including:
- High-density lipoprotein deficiency
- Hyperlipoproteinemia
- Atherosclerosis
- Alzheimer's disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
Management of diseases associated with variations in the APOC1 gene involves lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a healthy diet. Medications such as statins and fibrates may also be prescribed to help manage lipid levels in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia. The prognosis for individuals with APOC1 gene variations depends on the specific condition and severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
Individuals with certain APOC1 gene variations may respond differently to lipid-lowering medications such as statins. The presence of the C allele of the APOC1 -75G>C variant has been associated with reduced response to statin therapy.
