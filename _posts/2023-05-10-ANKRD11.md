# Information about gene ANKRD11

## Genetic position

The gene ANKRD11 is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.3).

## Pathology

Mutations in the ANKRD11 gene are associated with several disorders, including:

- KBG syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, skeletal abnormalities, distinct facial features, and other symptoms.
- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors.
- Schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and other symptoms.

## Function for Gene

The ANKRD11 gene encodes a protein that contains several ankyrin repeat domains. Ankyrin repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions and can mediate binding to specific target proteins. The ANKRD11 protein has been implicated in several cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, and cell migration.

## Related Disease

Some of the diseases associated with ANKRD11 gene are:

- KBG syndrome
- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
- Schizophrenia

## Treatment and prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for the genetic disorders associated with ANKRD11 mutations, such as KBG syndrome and ASD. Treatment is generally focused on managing the symptoms and providing support to affected individuals and their families. Prognosis varies depending on the disorder and the specific mutations involved.
