  - Abstract: KIAA0319 (6p22) and DCDC2 (6p22.3) have been implicated in several independent studies as candidate genes for developmental dyslexia (DD), a heritable language-based learning impairment. Recently, it has been demonstrated that KIAA0319 is involved in neuronal migration, and that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Kiaa0319 disrupts cortical neuron migration in rat. Here we present independent replication of association of KIAA0319 with DD in two samples, and subsequently examine association of KIAA0319 and its interaction with DCDC2 in three samples (ASPM: n = 405 families; IMGSAC: n = 279 families; and Oxford: n = 264 families) of autism spectrum disorder, a developmental disorder closely related to DD. Meta-analysis revealed strong association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6935076 within KIAA0319 with DD (most significant P-value = 0.00009, odds ratio (OR) = 1.64 (1.36-1.97). SNP rs6935076 is also highly associated with Asperger syndrome (AS), an autism spectrum disorder, in the combined Autism Genetic Resource Exchange/Oxford samples (P-value = 0.0005, OR = 1.61 (1.22-2.12). Meta-analysis of seven autism genome scan datasets, total case collection of 1,753 families, yielded significant association of rs6935076 with autism (P-value = 0.00008). Furthermore, we identified significant interaction between KIAA0319 and DCDC2 (most significant P-value = 0.0006) in the combined ASPM sample. Our findings suggest that KIAA0319 and DCDC2 contribute to aetiology of both DD and ASD.
