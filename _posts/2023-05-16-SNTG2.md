## Gene: SNTG2

### Genetic Position
The SNTG2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q21.31).

### Pathology
There is limited information available about the pathology associated with SNTG2 mutations. However, some studies have suggested that SNTG2 mutations may be associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay.

### Function
The exact function of the SNTG2 gene is unclear, but it is believed to play a role in neuronal development and function.
