## Gene Information

The gene TNC codes for the tenascin-C protein, which is involved in cell adhesion and migration. It is located on chromosome 9q33.1 and has a length of approximately 190 kb.

### Function

Tenascin-C is a large extracellular matrix protein involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. It plays a role in tissue repair and development, as well as in cancer progression and metastasis.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are several mutations reported in the TNC gene, some of which are associated with certain diseases. Here are some examples:

- p.Tyr313Cys: This missense mutation is associated with familial essential tremor. It is also reported in the dbSNP database with the ID rs201442904.
- p.Ile153Val: This missense mutation is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. It is also reported in the dbSNP database with the ID rs3766653.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations reported in the TNC gene, some of which are associated with cancer. Here are some examples:

- c.1023dupC: This frameshift mutation is reported in several types of cancer, including colon, breast, and lung cancer. It is also reported in the dbSNP database with the ID rs1555187620.
- c.1337A>G: This missense mutation is reported in ovarian cancer. It is also reported in the dbSNP database with the ID rs778209598.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the TNC gene have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Familial essential tremor: This is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary shaking of the limbs.
- Breast cancer: This is a type of cancer that starts in the breast tissue.
- Ovarian cancer: This is a type of cancer that starts in the ovaries.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for TNC-related diseases. However, some treatments are available to manage the symptoms of these diseases.

The prognosis for TNC-related diseases varies depending on the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response

There is currently no information available on the drug response of TNC-related diseases.
