# Information about Gene CHRNA1

## Genetic position

CHRNA1 is located on chromosome 2q31.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in CHRNA1 are associated with several neuromuscular diseases, including congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by weakness and fatigue in voluntary muscles.

## Function

The CHRNA1 gene encodes a subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates the effects of acetylcholine in the nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000162572
- OMIM: 100690
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P02708

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several amino acid mutations in CHRNA1 that are associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome, including:

- p.Ala5Val (dbSNP ID: rs121908577)
- p.Asn10Ser
- p.Gln45Arg (dbSNP ID: rs794726271)
- p.Tyr209Cys
- p.Pro251Leu

All of these mutations are missense mutations, meaning they cause a change in a single amino acid.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in CHRNA1.

## Related disease

Mutations in CHRNA1 are associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for congenital myasthenic syndrome, but treatment options include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which can help improve muscle function, and immunosuppressive therapy, which can reduce the severity of symptoms in some patients.

## Drug response

The response to drugs can vary depending on the specific mutation causing the disease and the severity of symptoms.
