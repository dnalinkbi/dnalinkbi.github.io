## SLC30A5 Gene Information

### Gene Position
SLC30A5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21.3). 

### Pathology
SLC30A5 gene mutations have been associated with various diseases such as breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. 

### Function
SLC30A5 encodes for a zinc transporter protein that plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular zinc homeostasis. The protein helps transport zinc ions out of the cell, preventing excessive zinc accumulation that can be toxic to the cells.
