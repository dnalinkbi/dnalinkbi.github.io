# TNF Gene Information

## Gene Function
The TNF gene (Tumor Necrosis Factor) encodes a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the regulation of immune cells, inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- Gene ID: 7124
- Genomic coordinates: GRCh38.p13 chr6:31,724,734-31,734,818
- Aliases: TNF, TNFA, TNFSF2

## External Sites
- HGNC: 11892
- NCBI Entrez: 7124
- Ensembl: ENSG00000232810
- OMIM: 191160
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01375

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
The TNF gene has several known genetic variations, including:
- rs1800629 (p.Arg92Pro)
- rs1799964 (p.Ala87Val)
- rs361525 (p.Leu10Pro)
- rs1800630 (p.Thr26Asn)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information on somatic mutations in the TNF gene.

## Related Diseases
The TNF gene has been associated with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including:
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Crohn's disease
- Psoriasis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are several drugs that target TNF to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab. These drugs have shown efficacy in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in patients. However, they can also have side effects, including increased risk of infections and cancers.

## Drug Response
Individuals with certain genetic variations in the TNF gene may respond differently to TNF-targeted drugs. For example, rs1800629 (p.Arg92Pro) has been associated with varied response to anti-TNF therapies.
