# Information about Gene CUL3

## Genetic Position

- CUL3 gene is located on the chromosome 2q36.1 (GRCh38.p13).
- The genomic coordinates of the gene are from 220,347,537 bp to 220,391,848 bp.


## Pathology and Function

- CUL3 is a member of the cullin family of proteins that participate in the formation of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs).
- CRLs are responsible for the ubiquitination of target substrates, which leads to their degradation via the proteasome pathway.
- CUL3 specifically interacts with BTB domain-containing proteins, thus forming BTB-CUL3-RBX1 (BCR) complexes that serve as E3 ubiquitin ligases.
- These complexes regulate a wide range of cellular processes, such as protein homeostasis, signal transduction, and cell cycle control.
- Mutations in CUL3 have been associated with a variety of diseases including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and hypertension.

## Related Diseases

- Cancer: CUL3 mutations have been linked to various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer.
- Neurodevelopmental disorders: Mutations in CUL3 have also been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability.
- Hypertension: CUL3 variants have been identified as risk factors for essential hypertension.


## Treatment and Prognosis

- CUL3 mutations can influence the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as the effectiveness of targeted therapies.
- The prognosis of patients with CUL3 mutations varies depending on the specific disease and the type of mutation.


## Drug Response

- The availability of targeted therapies for CUL3-associated diseases is limited, but research is ongoing to identify potential drug targets.
