# Gene Information for KLF8 

## Genetic Position 
* KLF8 gene is located on chromosome 5q31 
* The genomic location of KLF8 is chr5:139,580,386-139,621,223 

## Pathology 
* The KLF8 gene has been associated with multiple cancers including breast, lung, ovarian, and gastric cancer 
* Its expression has been shown to promote cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis 

## Function 
* KLF8 is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in development, proliferation, and differentiation 
* It has been shown to play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 

## External IDs and Aliases 
* HGNC: KLF8
* NCBI Entrez: 11278 
* Ensembl: ENSG00000113593 
* OMIM: 602102 
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y4X4 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID 
* c.545C>T (pArg182Cys) rs16931505 
* c.503G>A (pArg168His) rs2013964 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 
* c.364A>G (p.Gln122Arg) rs55655888 
* c.565C>T (p.Lys189Ter) rs772475869 

## Related Disease 
* Breast cancer 
* Lung cancer 
* Ovarian cancer 
* Gastric cancer 

## Treatment and Prognosis 
* KLF8 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment 
* Its expression has been associated with a poorer prognosis in cancer patients 

## Drug Response 
* A small molecule inhibitor of KLF8, HBF-0079 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in preclinical studies
