## Gene Information for MIPOL1

### Gene Function
MIPOL1 (also known as MTG8IP) is a gene that codes for a protein involved in maintaining the proper structure and organization of the cell's cytoskeleton. It plays a role in cell migration and division.

### IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: HGNC:34431
- NCBI Entrez: 79891
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135339
- OMIM: 615164
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IWY9

MIPOL1 is located on chromosome 10, specifically at the position 10q23.33.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP IDs
There are multiple known coding variants within the MIPOL1 gene, some of which are listed below:
- c.495G>C (p.Ala165Pro) - rs144836068
- c.947T>C (p.Ser316Pro) - rs150025370
- c.968A>G (p.Tyr323Cys) - rs372906936
- c.1381C>T (p.Ala461Val) - rs200313512

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs
There are several somatic variants in MIPOL1 that have been reported in cancer samples. Examples of these variants, along with their respective cancer types and dbSNP IDs, are:
- c.134C>T (p.Thr45Met) - gastric cancer - rs287771371
- c.440T>G (p.Phe147Leu) - endometrial cancer - rs781591564
- c.638G>A (p.Val213Ile) - ovarian cancer - rs370034464

### Related Diseases
Research has shown that mutations or dysregulation of MIPOL1 may contribute to the development of certain diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for diseases caused by MIPOL1 mutations. Treatment options typically depend on the specific disease, its severity, and other factors. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disease and its stage.

### Drug Response
There is limited information on MIPOL1's role in drug response. Further research is needed in this area.
