# Gene SIRT3

## Information about Gene SIRT3

**Genetic Position**: SIRT3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q22.3).

**Pathology**: Mutations in the SIRT3 gene have been associated with the development of various diseases like Type 2 diabetes, hearing loss, and cancer.

**Function**: SIRT3 gene encodes a protein called Sirtuin 3 that is involved in the regulation of several important cellular processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. SIRT3 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000166839
- OMIM: 611424
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NTG7

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 

There have been several AA mutations reported in the SIRT3 gene. Here is a list of some of the mutations along with their type and dbSNP ID:
- R102Q, Missense, rs61733261

- P217L, Missense, rs780011883
- R245C, Missense, rs796065178

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 

Several somatic mutations have been reported in the SIRT3 gene. Here is a list of some of the common somatic SNVs/InDels along with their dbSNP ID:
- rs138141383
- rs367825831
- rs786200764
- rs761295712
- rs763688804

**Related Diseases**:

Mutations in the SIRT3 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Type 2 diabetes
- Age-related hearing loss
- Cancer
- Neurodegenerative diseases

**Treatment and Prognosis**:

Currently, there is no specific treatment available for SIRT3 gene mutations. However, targeted therapies that regulate SIRT3 activity might be developed in the future.

**Drug Response**:

Studies have shown that drugs like metformin and resveratrol can activate the SIRT3 protein. These drugs have been found to be effective in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and cancer.
