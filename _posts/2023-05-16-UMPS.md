# Gene: UMPS

**Genetic Position**: Chromosome 3q13.33

**Pathology**: UMPS gene mutations have been linked with orotic aciduria, a rare metabolic disorder that affects the way the body produces and uses pyrimidines. This condition is characterized by the inability to synthesize uridine monophosphate (UMP), which leads to the accumulation of orotic acid in the urine.

**Function**: The UMPS gene encodes for the protein UMP synthase, which is critical for the synthesis of UMP. UMP synthase is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two separate reactions in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway.

**External IDs**:
- HGNC: 12518
- NCBI Entrez: 7371
- Ensembl: ENSG00000163719
- OMIM: 613891
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11172

**Aliases**: OMPDC, UMPS1, CAD, DUMPS, ODCase

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 

|AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| p.Ala277Thr | Missense | rs11538709 |
| p.Ser169Arg | Missense | rs61753642 |
| p.Glu206Lys | Missense | rs28942083 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the UMPS gene.

**Related Disease**: Orotic aciduria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of orotic acid in urine, usually presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the first months of life.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment for orotic aciduria depends on the severity of the condition and may include uridine supplementation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for individuals with this condition is generally good.

**Drug Response**: There is currently no known drug specifically targeted to the UMPS gene.
