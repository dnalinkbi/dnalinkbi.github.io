# Gene Information for MANBA

## Summary
The gene MANBA (Mannosidase Beta A) is located on human chromosome 4q22. Consisting of 20 exons, the gene encodes a protein of 828 amino acids. The MANBA gene is part of the glycosyl hydrolase 2 family and plays an important role in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. 

## Function
The MANBA gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme beta-mannosidase, which is involved in the degradation of N-linked oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. This process is important in the maintenance and turnover of glycoproteins in many tissues, including the central nervous system, and dysfunction in this gene has been associated with several conditions.

## Related diseases
Mutations in the MANBA gene have been associated with lysosomal storage disorders including Beta-mannosidosis, a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by intellectual disability, hearing loss, and impaired motor function.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for beta-mannosidosis, and treatment is symptomatic. Enzyme replacement therapy has been suggested as a potential treatment approach, and some preclinical studies have shown promise.

## Drug response
There is limited information available on drug response for beta-mannosidosis. However, small molecule chaperones and pharmacological chaperones have been proposed as potential approaches to enhance the stability and activity of the mutant MANBA protein.
