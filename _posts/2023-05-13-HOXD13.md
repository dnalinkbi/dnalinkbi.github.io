## **Gene Information: HOXD13**
HOXD13 is a protein-coding gene, belonging to the homeobox gene family. It is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 with the genomic location of 2q31.1. The gene comprises 9 exons, and the encoded protein contains 298 amino acids.

### **Function**
The HOXD13 gene is involved in limb development, particularly in the formation of the fingers and toes. It plays a crucial role in the patterning of the limb development along the proximal-distal axis. Additionally, it is involved in the development of hair follicles and sweat glands.

### **Related Disease**
Mutations in the HOXD13 gene are associated with various diseases, the most common being synpolydactyly. Synpolydactyly is a congenital disorder where the individual has fused or webbed fingers or toes.

### **Treatment and Prognosis**
Currently, there is no cure for synpolydactyly, but surgery can be performed to separate the fused digits and improve limb function. The prognosis for individuals with synpolydactyly depends on the severity and extent of the malformation, as well as the age of the individual at the time of diagnosis.

### **Drug Response**
There is no known drug to treat synpolydactyly, and no data is available on the drug response of HOXD13-related diseases.
