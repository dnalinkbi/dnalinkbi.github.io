## Gene: CNGA1
### Information:
- **Function for gene:** Cyclic nucleotide gated channel alpha 1 (CNGA1) is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel family. CNGA1 encodes for the alpha subunit of the CNG channel which is involved in visual and olfactory signal transduction.
