## Gene name and Pathology

**Gene name**: HBA1

**Pathology**: HBA1 encodes alpha-1 globin chain, a subunit of hemoglobin. Mutations in this gene are associated with various forms of alpha-thalassemia and hemoglobin H disease.

## Function

Alpha-1 globin chain is a major component of hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood.

## External IDs and aliases

**External IDs**: HGNC:482, NCBI Entrez: 3031, Ensembl:ENSG00000244734, OMIM:141800, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P69905.

**Aliases**: Alpha-1 globin, HBA-A1, HBA1A.

There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels of HBA1.

## Related Disease

Mutations in HBA1 are associated with various forms of alpha-thalassemia and hemoglobin H disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for alpha-thalassemia and hemoglobin H disease depend on the severity of the disease and the specific mutations present. Treatment options may include blood transfusions, bone marrow transplantation, and supportive care.

## Drug Response

The drug response for alpha-thalassemia and hemoglobin H disease varies depending on the specific mutations present. Several drugs, such as hydroxyurea and butyrate, have been tested for their potential to increase HbF expression and improve symptoms in patients with these conditions.
