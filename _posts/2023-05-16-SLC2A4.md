# Information about gene SLC2A4

## Genetic Position
SLC2A4 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at position 12.1. 

## Pathology
Pathologies related to the malfunction of the SLC2A4 gene include glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

## Function
SLC2A4 gene encodes glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), which is responsible for insulin-regulated glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. GLUT4 is the predominant glucose transporter in these tissues.
