# Gene: SLC25A20

## Information
SLC25A20 gene encodes a mitochondrial carrier protein that transports acylcarnitines into the mitochondria for use in oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, it plays a critical role in the urea cycle by transporting ornithine into mitochondria for further metabolism. Mutations in SLC25A20 cause carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD), leading to disrupted mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and impaired urea cycle function.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are no known somatic mutations in SLC25A20.

## Related Disease
Mutations in SLC25A20 are associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD), characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and encephalopathy. Other symptoms include elevated levels of acylcarnitine and low plasma levels of free carnitine.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of CACTD typically involves a low-fat diet, frequent feedings, and carnitine supplementation. Prognosis for individuals with CACTD is variable and depends on the severity of the condition and time of diagnosis.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response specifically for SLC25A20-related conditions.
