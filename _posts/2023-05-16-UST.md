# Gene UST

### General Information
- Chromosomal Location: 7q11.23
- Alias: U2AF1-RS2, U2AF1L2
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 22344
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 55557
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000213452
    - OMIM: 606659
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6P1J9

### Function
UST encodes for U2AF1-RS2 protein, which plays a key role in pre-mRNA splicing. Additionally, it has been observed that UST interacts with several proteins involved in RNA splicing. 

### Mutations
- AA Mutation List and Mutation Type: There are few missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations observed in the UST gene. These genetic variants could result in truncated or altered proteins causing changes in the function and stability of the U2AF1-RS2 protein.
    - Example missense mutation: c.187A>T; p.(Tyr63Phe)
    - dbSNP ID: rs141500278
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: Currently, there is no information available regarding somatic mutations in the UST gene.

### Related Diseases
There are no diseases associated directly with UST mutations. However, there are several diseases related to defects in RNA splicing processes, where UST may also play a role.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for UST mutations or RNA splicing defects. However, research in this field is ongoing.

### Drug Response
There is no information available on drug response related to UST.
