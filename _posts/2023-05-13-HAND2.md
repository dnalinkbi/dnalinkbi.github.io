## Related Diseases

- HAND2 deficiency and dysfunction has been associated with congenital heart defects such as atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and pulmonary valve stenosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment varies depending on the severity of the congenital heart defects. Surgical intervention may be necessary.
- Prognosis also varies depending on the severity of the congenital heart defects and timely interventions.

## Drug Response

- There is currently no information available regarding drug response in HAND2-related congenital heart defects.
