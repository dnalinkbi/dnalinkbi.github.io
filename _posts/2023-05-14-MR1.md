# Gene MR1

## Overview

MR1, or MHC class I-related protein 1, is a gene located on chromosome 1. It encodes for a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like family. 

## Function

The protein encoded by MR1 is responsible for stimulating immune responses by presenting antigens to T cells. Specifically, it presents small molecules from microbial metabolites to T cells, which can then trigger an immune response.

## AA Mutation List

At present, there are no recorded AA mutations for the MR1 gene.

## Somatic SNVs/ InDels

There are currently no known somatic SNVs/ InDels with dbSNP ID associated with MR1. 

## Related Diseases

Recent studies have implicated MR1 in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

As the role of MR1 in disease is still being researched, there are no targeted treatments available at present. The prognosis of diseases associated with MR1 may vary depending on the individual case. 

## Drug Response

There is limited information on how MR1 may respond to specific drugs as research on this topic is currently ongoing.
