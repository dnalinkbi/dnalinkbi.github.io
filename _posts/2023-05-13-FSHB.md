## Gene FSHB

### Genetic Position
FSHB gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the FSHB gene have not been reported yet, however, other mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) pathway have been associated with infertility and abnormal folliculogenesis.

### Function
FSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. The hormone regulates the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles in females and spermatogenesis in males.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
No variants were found in the AA mutation list and dbSNP database.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations were found in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the FSHB gene have not been reported yet. However, dysregulation of FSH levels has been associated with several reproductive disorders, particularly infertility.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of infertility caused by FSH dysregulation depend on the underlying cause and severity of the condition.

### Drug Response
FSH receptor agonists and antagonists have been developed for the treatment of infertility and reproductive disorders. The response to these drugs varies depending on the individual and the specific condition being treated.
