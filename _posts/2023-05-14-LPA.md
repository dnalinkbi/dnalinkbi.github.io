## Gene LPA

### Genetic Position

The gene LPA is located on chromosome 6q27 and spans 46.6 kb of genomic DNA.

### Pathology

The LPA gene encodes apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), a component of lipoprotein(a) particles. High plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) have been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and aortic stenosis.

### Function

Apolipoprotein(a) is responsible for blocking the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, which in turn leads to impaired fibrinolysis and increased risk of thrombosis.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic mutations in the LPA gene with dbSNP ID.

### Related Disease

High levels of lipoprotein(a) have been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and aortic stenosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment for elevated levels of lipoprotein(a). However, lowering LDL cholesterol is recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Drug Response

There is no known drug response for mutations in the LPA gene.
