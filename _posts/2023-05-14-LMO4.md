## Gene Information

### Gene Name: LMO4

### Gene Function
LMO4 gene encodes LIM domain only 4 protein. It acts as a transcription regulator and plays an important role in embryonic development, differentiation, and the formation of normal neural patterns. It also contributes to cancer progression by promoting proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and stemness.

### Genomic  Location
GeneID: 8546 , Chr.1q21.3

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6645
- NCBI Entrez: 8546
- Ensembl: ENSG00000174010
- OMIM: 603719
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95361

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several SNPs present in the LMO4 gene. Some of the missense mutations with dbSNP ID are as follows:

| Protein change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID   |
|:--------------|:-------------|:----------|
| L16F           | Missense     | rs11540652 |
| S84N           | Missense     | rs2291125  |
| A87T           | Missense     | rs3744436  |
| D113N          | Missense     | rs6713837  |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some of the somatic mutations in the LMO4 gene with dbSNP ID are as follows:

| Protein change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID   |
|:--------------|:-------------|:----------|
| P68L           | Missense     | rs267606920|
| Y130C          | Missense     | rs142202172|
| P247Q          | Missense     | rs781103197|

### Related Disease
LMO4 has been associated with various diseases such as cancer, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific drug or treatment available targeting LMO4 gene. As it is involved in cancer progression, targeting LMO4 along with other therapy may improve the treatment outcome. The prognosis depends on the type and stage of cancer.

### Drug Response
There is no specific drug response reported for LMO4 gene.
