# Information about gene APC

## General Information

**Gene:** APC ([Adenomatous polyposis coli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/324)) \
**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 5 (5q21-q22) \
**Aliases:** DP2.5, DP2.5L1, DP2.5L2, DP2.5L3, FPC, GS, PPP1R46

## Function

APC is involved in the regulation of cell division, cell adhesion, and migration. It is a tumor suppressor gene and is known for its role in the development of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). The protein encoded by APC binds to beta-catenin, a protein that regulates gene expression, and targets it for degradation.

## Related Disease

- Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
- Gardner Syndrome
- Turcot Syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, surgical removal of affected tissue is the primary treatment for FAP. Patients may also undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis depends on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug response

APC mutations may affect the response to certain chemotherapeutic agents. In one study, colorectal cancer patients with APC mutations did not respond as well to 5-fluorouracil treatment.
