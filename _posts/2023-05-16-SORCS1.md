# Information about gene SORCS1

### Genetic position
The SORCS1 gene is located on chromosome 10q25.1.

### Pathology
The SORCS1 gene has been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease. It is believed to play a role in the clearance of beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease.

### Function
The SORCS1 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in protein trafficking and sorting. Specifically, it is involved in the regulation of the synthesis, delivery, and/or endocytosis of various signaling receptors and adhesion molecules.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 19986
- NCBI Entrez: 6653
- Ensembl: ENSG00000165610
- OMIM: 608983
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HBG4

Aliases for the SORCS1 gene include VPS10P domain-containing receptor 2, sortilin-related VPS10 domain-containing receptor 1, and SORLA-related protein 1. 

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known AA mutations in the SORCS1 gene, including:
- V833M (dbSNP ID: rs374068610)
- E896K (dbSNP ID: rs2289507)

Both of these mutations have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the SORCS1 gene.

### Related disease
The SORCS1 gene has been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Some studies have also suggested a possible association with type 2 diabetes.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no known cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, there are medications and other treatments available that can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

### Drug response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeted to the SORCS1 gene. However, some drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, may indirectly affect the function of the SORCS1 protein.
