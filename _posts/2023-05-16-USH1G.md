# Gene USH1G

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17q25.1

**Pathology:** USH1G gene mutations are associated with Usher syndrome type 1G (USH1G), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by deafness, severe balance problems, and early onset of vision loss. USH1G mutations affect the development and function of sensory cells in the inner ear and retina.

## Function

The USH1G gene encodes the scaffold protein SANS (scaffold protein containing ankyrin repeats and SAM domain), which plays a role in maintaining the structure and function of hair cells in the inner ear and photoreceptor cells in the retina. SANS interacts with other proteins to form protein complexes that are important for the normal function of sensory cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is no known association of somatic SNVs/InDels with the USH1G gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the USH1G gene are associated with Usher syndrome type 1G (USH1G), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by deafness, severe balance problems, and early onset of vision loss. USH1G mutations affect the development and function of sensory cells in the inner ear and retina.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for USH1G, and treatment options are limited. Management generally focuses on relieving symptoms, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants for hearing loss, and low-vision aids for vision loss. The prognosis for individuals with USH1G depends on the severity and progression of their symptoms.

## Drug Response

Currently, there are no drugs that directly target USH1G mutations. However, research efforts are underway to develop new therapies, such as gene therapy and pharmacological interventions, to treat the underlying causes of Usher syndrome.
