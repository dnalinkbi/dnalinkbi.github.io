# Gene: ABAT

## Position
The ABAT gene is located on chromosome 16 at position q21.2.

## Pathology and Function
The ABAT gene encodes the enzyme 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase which is responsible for the catabolism of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a range of neurological disorders including succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, autosomal recessive intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder.

## Gene Information
- Function: 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase
- External IDs: HGNC: 42, NCBI Entrez: 18, Ensembl: ENSG00000102931, OMIM: 137150, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P80404
- Aliases: GABAT, KAT4

## Mutation Information
- AA mutation list: Several amino acid mutations have been identified in the ABAT gene including A205T, G43C, and R152C.
- Mutation type: Missense variants
- dbSNP ID: rs1048865, rs758710845, rs398124253

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information available about somatic SNVs/InDels in the ABAT gene.

## Related Disease
- Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency
- Autosomal recessive intellectual disability
- Autism spectrum disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for ABAT-related disorders. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

## Drug Response
There is no information available about drug response in ABAT-related disorders.
