# Information about Gene WNK2

## Genetic Position
The WNK2 gene is located on chromosome 9q22.31 and spans 113,507 base pairs.

## Pathology
WNK2 mutations have been associated with essential hypertension, a common disease that affects blood pressure. It has also been linked to renal tubular acidosis and Alzheimer's disease.

## Function
WNK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a role in regulating the ion balance in cells and is involved in multiple signaling pathways in the body. It has been identified to modulate a number of ion channels, including sodium, chloride, and potassium channels.
