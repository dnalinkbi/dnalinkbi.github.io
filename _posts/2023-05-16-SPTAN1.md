## Information about gene SPTAN1

### Genetic position
* Chromosome: 9
* Genetic locus: p11.2
* Genomic position: 21,626,022 - 21,793,941

### Pathology 
* SPTAN1 is associated with a variety of neurological disorders, including early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Mutations in this gene impair the normal function of the alpha-II spectrin protein, which is important for brain development and neuronal integrity.

### Function for gene
* SPTAN1 encodes the alpha-II spectrin protein, which is involved in the maintenance of cellular shape, structural stability, and membrane integrity. This protein also helps to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular migration.
