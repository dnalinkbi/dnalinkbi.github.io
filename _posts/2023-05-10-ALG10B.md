# ALG10B gene information

## Genetic position and pathology
ALG10B is a gene located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q24.31. The ALG10B gene is associated with Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIf (CDG2F), a rare genetic disorder that affects the glycosylation process. 

## Function for gene
ALG10B gene encodes a protein that is involved in the formation of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursors essential for N-linked glycosylation. Mutations in this gene can cause defects in glycosylation and lead to the development of CDG2F.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Lys102fs is a frameshift mutation caused by the insertion of a cytosine nucleotide into codon 102; this mutation is also known as c.304dupC (dbSNP ID: rs1555269295).
- p.Ser170Phe is a missense mutation caused by the substitution of a cytosine nucleotide for a thymine nucleotide at position 508; this mutation is also known as c.508T>C (dbSNP ID: rs1555270307).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations for the ALG10B gene reported in dbSNP.

## Related disease
ALG10B gene mutations are associated with Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIf (CDG2F), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the glycosylation process.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for CDG2F. Treatment is largely based on the specific symptoms of the patient and may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and medications to manage seizures or infections. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and individual cases.

## Drug response
Currently, there are no drugs available specific for treating CDG2F. Treatment is predominantly supportive and symptom-based.
