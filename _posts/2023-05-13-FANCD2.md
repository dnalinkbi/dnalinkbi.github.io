# Information on Gene FANCD2

## Genetic Position
FANCD2 gene is located on the chromosome 3q22.3, from base pair 132,895,222 to base pair 133,080,485.

## Pathology
Mutations in the FANCD2 gene are associated with the rare genetic disorder Fanconi anemia (FA), which is characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancer.

## Function
FANCD2 plays a crucial role in the DNA repair pathway known as the Fanconi anemia pathway. It participates in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks through homologous recombination and stabilizes replication forks during DNA synthesis.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations reported in the FANCD2 gene. Some of these include:
- p.Ile1084Val (rs879255874) - missense mutation
- p.Gly350Arg (rs137853358) - missense mutation
- p.Ala605Val (rs137853357) - missense mutation
- p.Pro301Leu (rs137853359) - missense mutation

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some of the somatic mutations reported in the FANCD2 gene include:
- c.750delT (rs914928327)
- c.842G>A (rs886039756)
- c.1661C>T (rs886039785)

## Related Disease
Mutations in FANCD2 gene are associated with Fanconi anemia, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems and increasing the risk of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The management of Fanconi anemia focuses on treating the bone marrow failure and cancer that are associated with the disease. Bone marrow transplant is a common treatment for severe bone marrow failure.

## Drug Response
Research studies show that PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, may be an effective therapy for Fanconi anemia patients with DNA repair deficiency, including those with FANCD2 mutations.
