# Gene SCN3B

## Basic Information
* Function: The gene SCN3B encodes a protein subunit critical for voltage-gated sodium channel function. It is a regulatory subunit that modulates the kinetics of the channel.
* External IDs: HGNC: 10565, NCBI Entrez: 10723, Ensembl: ENSG00000116288, OMIM: 608201, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60939
* Genomic Location: Chromosome 11 (11q24.2)

## Mutation Information
* AA Mutation List: There are numerous amino acid (AA) mutations that have been reported, including: F28L, L182P, A218V, S236N, G257R, M323T, and many more.
* Mutation Types: Missense, nonsynonymous
* dbSNP ID: rs34271062, rs200038026, rs200103067, and many more.

## Related Diseases
* SCN3B variants have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cardiac arrhythmias, autism, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain.

## Treatment and Prognosis
* Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific disease associated with the SCN3B variant.
* In general, treatment involves addressing symptoms and managing complications.

## Drug Response
* Drug response may also vary depending on the specific disease associated with the SCN3B variant.
* Some research has suggested that certain SCN3B variants may have an impact on drug response in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
