# Gene HMMR 

## Genetic Position
The HMMR (Hyaluronan mediated motility receptor) gene is located on the human chromosome 5q34.3. The gene spans 67.3 kb and contains 23 exons.

## Pathology
HMMR is associated with various pathologies, including cancers and neural tube defects. Abnormal expression of HMMR has been observed in a wide range of cancers, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. 

## Function
HMMR encodes a cell surface receptor that binds to the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan. The protein regulates cell motility and is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

## Related Disease
HMMR has been associated with various cancer types, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting HMMR has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for cancer. Antibodies against HMMR have been shown to inhibit cancer growth in preclinical studies. Additionally, HMMR expression has been correlated with poor prognosis in several cancer types.

## Drug Response
There is evidence that HMMR expression may be predictive of drug response in certain cancer types. For example, high HMMR expression has been associated with sensitivity to taxane-based chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
