# Gene information for PEX1 

## Genetic Position and Pathology
PEX1 is a gene located on chromosome 7 at the position 7q21.2. Mutations in this gene are associated with the peroxisome biogenesis disorder, Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neurological symptoms, hypotonia, seizures, liver dysfunction, and developmental delay.  

## Function
PEX1 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisome biogenesis by serving as a receptor for import of newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins. The protein encoded by PEX1 is responsible for the ATP-dependent translocation of newly imported proteins from the cytosol into the peroxisome matrix.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- c.2098A>G (p.Tyr700Cys); rs367543167
- c.2098A>T (p.Tyr700Phe); rs121908478
- c.2908C>T (p.Arg970Cys); rs137852660
- The above mutations are single nucleotide substitutions causing amino acid changes. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels affecting PEX1.

## Related Disease
As mentioned earlier, mutations in PEX1 are associated with Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), which is a rare and severe disorder. There have been reported cases where missense variants in PEX1 have been associated with a milder form of the phenotype.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Zellweger syndrome spectrum. The treatment focuses on the symptomatic relief of the patient by administering drugs or therapy to improve the quality of life. There is no known standard life expectancy.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs specifically targeting PEX1. Although there are approaches under study to treat peroxisomal disorders using gene therapy or liver transplantation.
