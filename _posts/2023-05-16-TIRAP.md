# Information on Gene TIRAP

**Genetic Position**
- Gene: TIRAP (toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein)
- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11q24.2

**Pathology**
- TIRAP gene has been associated with various diseases such as asthma, sepsis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

**Function**
- TIRAP plays a role in the activation of the innate immune response by mediating the signal transduction pathway of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs).

**External IDs and Aliases**
- HGNC: 11830
- NCBI Entrez: 114609
- Ensembl: ENSG00000162368
- OMIM: 606252
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86XR7

**AA Mutation List**
- p.Leu105Phe (rs8177374)
- p.Asp88Asn (rs8177375)
- p.Ser180Leu (rs3794269)
- p.Arg201Leu (rs8177404)
- p.Asp162Asn (rs8177401)

**Mutation Type**
- Missense 

**Somatic SNVs/InDels**
- rs36284801
- rs74117847

**Related Diseases**
- Asthma
- Sepsis
- Rheumatoid arthritis

**Treatment and Prognosis**
- Treatment for diseases associated with TIRAP gene are based on the specific illness and can range from antibiotics and antifungal medications to respiratory treatments and immunosuppressants.
- Prognosis is also dependent on the specific disease and severity.

**Drug Response**
- Studies suggest that inhibitors of TIRAP and TLR pathways could be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in various diseases.
