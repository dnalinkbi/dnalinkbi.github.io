# Gene Information

## Gene Name and Genomic Position
The gene of interest is TSPAN17 which stands for Tetraspanin 17. It is located on chromosome 1 and its genomic position is 1p13.1. 

## Pathology 
The deficiency of TSPAN17 gene has been implicated in the development of various types of cancer such as colorectal, breast, and lung cancer.

## Gene Function 
TSPAN17 gene codes for tetraspanin-17 protein whose function is to facilitate cell signaling, cell adhesion, and cell motility. This protein is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation processes.
