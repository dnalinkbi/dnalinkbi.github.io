# Information on Gene CDH3

## Genomic Position
The gene CDH3 is located on chromosome 16 at the position 16q22.1.

## Pathology and Function
The CDH3 gene encodes Cadherin-3, which is a calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of epithelial tissues by mediating cell-cell adhesion. Mutations in this gene have been associated with cancer progression and metastasis.

- c.250T>C (missense) with dbSNP ID rs2229189
- c.76G>C (missense) with dbSNP ID rs2229190

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified in the CDH3 gene. Some of these variants and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are as follows:
- c.998C>G with dbSNP ID rs118874683
- c.1172G>A with dbSNP ID rs78139139
- c.1014-1G>T with dbSNP ID rs886052892

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CDH3 gene have been associated with various cancer types such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment options and prognosis for CDH3-related cancers vary depending on the cancer type, stage, and other factors. Further research is needed to develop effective treatments.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response for CDH3-related cancers. However, some studies have suggested that certain drugs targeting Cadherin-3 could be used as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.
