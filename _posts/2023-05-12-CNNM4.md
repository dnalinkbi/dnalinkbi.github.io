# Information about Gene CNNM4


### Genetic Position

Gene CNNM4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q11.2-q14.2)

### Pathology

Mutations in the CNNM4 gene are associated with inherited retinal diseases such as cone-rod dystrophy, macular dystrophy and night blindness.

### Function for gene

The CNNM4 gene encodes for a metal transporter called cyclin M4. Cyclin M4 is involved in transporting magnesium and manganese ions across cellular membranes.
