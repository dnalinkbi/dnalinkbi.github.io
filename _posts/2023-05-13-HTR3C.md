# Information about Gene HTR3C

## Genetic Position

The HTR3C gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q29.

## Pathology

The HTR3C gene is associated with various disorders such as alcohol dependence and heroin addiction. Studies have shown that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene may alter the risk for these addictive behaviors.

## Function

The HTR3C gene encodes a protein known as 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3C. This protein is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor family and is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000175207
- OMIM: 606192
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N1M0

Aliases: 5-HT3C, 5-HT3-like receptor

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

No amino acid mutations associated with HTR3C have been reported yet.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic variants have been reported in this gene.

## Related Disease

The HTR3C gene is associated with various disorders such as:
- Alcohol dependence 
- Heroin addiction

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known targeted treatment for genetic variations in HTR3C. 
Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the associated disorder.

## Drug Response

Studies suggest that certain drug responses may be influenced by genetic variations in HTR3C. For example, some studies have shown that HTR3C variations may affect the response to certain anti-nausea medications.
