# Information about Gene TCN1 

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 18: 57,557,359 - 57,565,738

**Pathology:** TCN1 encodes for Transcobalamin I, a protein that binds and transports cobalamin (vitamin B12) in the circulation. Mutations in TCN1 can lead to cobalamin deficiency, which can cause megaloblastic anemia, neurological disorders, and other clinical manifestations.

**Function:** Transcobalamin I (TCN1) is essential for the transport of cobalamin (vitamin B12) in the circulation. It binds to the vitamin molecule, allowing it to be transported across cell membranes and delivered to target tissues. TCN1 is mainly synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, where it forms a complex with cobalamin and delivers it to cells that express the receptor for TCN1.
