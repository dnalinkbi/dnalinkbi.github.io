## Information about gene MMADHC

### Genetic Position and Pathology

- Gene: MMADHC
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2q23.2
- Pathology: Mutations in MMADHC gene can cause methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblD type. This is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12).

### Function for Gene

MMADHC gene encodes a protein that plays a key role in the intracellular processing of cobalamin. This protein is involved in the conversion of cobalamin into its functional coenzyme forms, such as methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. These coenzymes are essential for various biochemical pathways, including the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, and the synthesis of DNA.
