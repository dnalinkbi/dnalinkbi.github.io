# Information on Gene RPSA

## Genetic Position, Aliases and External IDs

The RPSA gene, also known as "Ribosomal protein SA" or "37/67 kDa laminin receptor", is located on chromosome 3 (3p22.3). The gene has an mRNA length of 1581 bp and the protein-coding sequence is 417 bp long. It has several aliases, including "LAMR1", "67LR", "p40", and "PRP19".

External IDs for the gene and genomic location can be found in the following databases:
- HGNC: 10417
- NCBI Entrez: 3920
- Ensembl: ENSG00000114013
- OMIM: 180435
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08865

## Function of the Gene

The RPSA gene encodes for a protein known as ribosomal protein SA. Ribosomal protein SA is a component of the small subunit of the ribosome and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, protein translation, and cell adhesion.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RPSA gene, some of which result in amino acid changes in the protein. Here are some common examples:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gly10Arg | Missense | rs11546407 |
| Ser14Leu | Missense | rs34456069 |
| Leu178Phe | Missense | rs1138272 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the RPSA gene so far.

## Related Disease

Research has linked the RPSA gene to various diseases such as tumors, bacterial infections, and neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, ribosomal protein SA was shown to be up-regulated in various cancer types including pancreatic, ovarian, lung and breast cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for genetic alterations in the RPSA gene. However, further research may provide better insight into possible treatments.

## Drug Response

Currently, there is no available information about the drug response of RPSA gene variants.
