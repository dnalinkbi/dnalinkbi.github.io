# Gene CYP4F22

This gene is located on chromosome 19 at position q13.2. It encodes for cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 22 (CYP4F22).

## Function
CYP4F22 is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and is responsible for the production of Ï‰-hydroxyceramides, which are essential for maintenance of the skin barrier function.
