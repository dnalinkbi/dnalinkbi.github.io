## Gene: COG8
### Genetic Position 
The COG8 gene is located on chromosome 16p13.3 and spans 20 kilobases.

### Pathology and Function 
COG8 encodes for a protein required for normal Golgi function. Specifically, it is involved in intra-Golgi transport. Mutations in this gene have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, including type II.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the COG8 gene, with the following amino acid changes:
- p.His12Arg (rs145018840)
- p.Leu54Phe (rs369498225)
- p.Leu60Pro (rs137852784)

All of these mutations are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the COG8 gene.

### Related Disease
Variations in COG8 have been linked to several congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), including type II, which is characterized by severe neurological impairment and often early death.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for CDGs often involves symptom management and supportive therapies. The prognosis for these disorders varies depending on the specific type and severity.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug for the direct treatment of CDGs. However, ongoing research is exploring potential therapies.
