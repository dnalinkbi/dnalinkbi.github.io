## Gene: CYP3A4

- **Function:** This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. The protein encoded by CYP3A4 metabolizes almost 50% of drugs, including several anticancer drugs, leading to pharmacologic and toxicologic effects.

- **Related Diseases:** 
    - CYP3A4 is associated with drug-induced liver injury, which can be caused by drugs metabolized by the enzyme.
    - Genetic variations in CYP3A4 can impact the metabolism of many drugs, leading to variable clinical outcomes.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - The impact of CYP3A4 genetic variation on drug metabolism can affect the efficacy of drugs and lead to adverse drug reactions. Thus, the knowledge of CYP3A4 genotype can be used to personalize drug therapy and optimize treatment outcomes.

- **Drug Response:**
    - The metabolism of many drugs, including anticancer drugs, is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Genetic variations in the gene can lead to altered drug efficacy and toxicity.
