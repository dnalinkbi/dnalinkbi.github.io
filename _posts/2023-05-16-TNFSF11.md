## Gene: TNFSF11

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- TNFSF11 (Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11) is located on chromosome 13q14 and contains 5 exons.
- It has been shown to be involved in the regulation of bone remodeling and immune system function. 
- Mutations in TNFSF11 have been associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy and rare genetic bone disorders such as osteopetrosis.

### Function 
- TNFSF11 plays a critical role in the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, which are cells responsible for breaking down and resorbing bone tissue. 
- It is also an important regulator of the immune response, particularly the differentiation and activation of dendritic cells, which are antigen-presenting cells important in initiating the adaptive immune response. 

### External IDs and Aliases

### Related Diseases
- Osteoporosis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Paget's disease of bone
- Hypercalcemia of malignancy

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Drugs targeting TNFSF11 activity have shown promising results in the treatment of bone disorders such as osteoporosis and bone metastases.
- Inhibition of TNFSF11 may also have potential applications in the treatment of autoimmune disorders.
- The prognosis for patients with TNFSF11 mutations depends on the specific disorder and severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response
- Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets TNFSF11 and has been shown to increase bone density and reduce the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis.
- Other drugs targeting TNFSF11, such as AMG-162 and ONO-7318, are currently in development.
