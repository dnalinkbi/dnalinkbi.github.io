## Gene: EMX1

### Genetic position and genomic location
- EMX1 is located on Chromosome 2 at position 2p13.3  
- The genomic location is from 55,221,238 to 55,231,093 (GRCh38.p13)

### Pathology and Function
- EMX1 is a homeobox gene that encodes a transcription factor. 
- The protein product of this gene is primarily expressed in the developing cerebral cortex and is involved in the regulation of cortical development. 
- Mutations in EMX1 have been associated with different neuronal disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.

### External IDs and aliases
- HGNC ID: 3357

- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000115263
- OMIM ID: 600037
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q04741
- Other aliases: Empty spiracles homeobox 1, empty spiracles-like protein 1, and ESX1.

### AA mutation and SNP
- There are several mutations reported in the AA sequence of EMX1 that have been associated with different neurological disorders.
    - p.Arg16His with dbSNP ID: rs133653223
    - p.Arg194Cys with dbSNP ID: rs144691466
    - p.Arg202Trp with dbSNP ID: rs137854064
    - p.Arg247Gln with dbSNP ID: rs202233981

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
