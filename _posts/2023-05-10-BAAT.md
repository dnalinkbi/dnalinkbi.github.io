# Gene BAAT

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** 9q31.1
- **Pathology:** BAAT gene-related disorders can lead to abnormalities in bile acid metabolism which can cause cholestasis, a liver disorder characterized by the reduction or stoppage of bile flow.
- **Function:** The BAAT gene encodes bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids with either glycine or taurine making them more soluble and improving their excretion via bile.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 570
    - Genomic Location: NC_000009.12 
    - Aliases: BACAT, NAT8
- **External Sites:**
    - HGNC: [BAAT](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:938/))
    - NCBI Entrez: [BAAT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/570))

    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: [P80404](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80404))

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are several missense mutations identified in the BAAT gene. Some of these include:
    - p.Arg233His (rs72558109)
    - p.Arg336Cys (rs72558110)
    - p.Leu259Phe (rs72558111)
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs72558109, rs72558110, rs72558111

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- There are somatic variants identified in the BAAT gene that are associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
- **dbSNP ID:** Not available

## Related Disease
- **Disease Name:** Primary Biliary Cholangitis
- **Description:** It is an autoimmune disease that damages the liver's small bile ducts leading to cholestasis. Genetic mutations in the BAAT gene could increase the risk for developing PBC.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for PBC typically involves the use of bile acid-binding resins and immunosuppressive therapies to prevent or slow further damage to the liver. Patients may also benefit from liver transplantation in severe cases.
- The prognosis for PBC varies depending on the severity of the disease and the extent of liver damage at the time of diagnosis.

## Drug Response
- **Drug Name:** Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
- **Response:** UDCA is used in the treatment of PBC and has been shown to improve patient outcomes by reducing the risk of liver failure and the need for liver transplantation.
