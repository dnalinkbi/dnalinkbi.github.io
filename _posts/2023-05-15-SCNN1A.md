## Gene SCNN1A

- **Function:** The gene SCNN1A encodes for the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is involved in regulating sodium absorption in epithelial tissues such as the lungs, kidneys, and colon.

- **External IDs:**
    - Gene: SCNN1A
    - Genomic Location: Chr 12q13.11
    - Aliases: ENaCα, ASIC2, BESC1, SCNEA1, α-ENaC

- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: 10652
    - NCBI Entrez: 6337
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000111676
    - OMIM: 600228
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P37088

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.1459G>A (p.Gly487Asp) - rs374191098
    - c.1697G>A (p.Arg566His) - rs28933374
    - c.2037C>T (p.Arg679Trp) - rs121908033
    - c.2275C>T (p.Ser759Leu) - rs28933375

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - None reported

- **Related disease:** 
    - Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder that leads to hypertension due to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. Mutations in SCNN1A result in the overactivity of ENaC channels, leading to excessive sodium absorption and water retention in the body.

- **Treatment and prognosis:**
    - Thiazide diuretics and amiloride are effective in treating hypertension in Liddle syndrome patients by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. Prognosis is usually good with proper treatment.

- **Drug response:**
    - Thiazide diuretics and amiloride are effective in treating hypertension in Liddle syndrome patients.
