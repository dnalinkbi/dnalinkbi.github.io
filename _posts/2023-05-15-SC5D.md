# Information about gene SC5D

## Genetic Position
The SC5D gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.3) and spans 46,098 base pairs.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SC5D gene have been associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of inherited skin disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin.

## Function for gene
The SC5D gene encodes an enzyme called sterol-C5-desaturase, which converts dihydrolanosterol to cholesterol in the last step of cholesterol synthesis.

- NCBI Entrez: 6304
- Ensembl: ENSG00000136003
- OMIM: 604370
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14534
- Alias: CHOLE5DES1, SRD5

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Two missense mutations in the SC5D gene have been reported to cause ARCI:
- p.Leu337Pro (rs750535032)
- p.Ile183Thr (rs786205162)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the SC5D gene.

## Related Disease
- Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for ARCI is supportive and focused on relieving symptoms such as itching and preventing infections. The prognosis for individuals with ARCI varies depending on the severity of their condition.

## Drug Response
There is currently no FDA-approved drug for ARCI. However, retinoids such as acitretin and isotretinoin have been used off-label with varying success.
