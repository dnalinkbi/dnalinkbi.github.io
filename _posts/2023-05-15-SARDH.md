# Gene SARDH

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** 2q35
- **Pathology:** Mutations in SARDH gene are associated with the disease SARDH deficiency, which leads to a buildup of sarcosine and decreased levels of glycine, which can cause intellectual disability, hypotonia, and seizures.
- **Function:** SARDH gene encodes sarcosine dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of amino acids, especially the conversion of sarcosine to glycine.
- **Aliases:** SARD, SARDase, SARCDS

## External IDs
- **HGNC:** 10529
- **NCBI Entrez:** 51158
- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000043878
- **OMIM:** 603471
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:** Q9UBQ7
