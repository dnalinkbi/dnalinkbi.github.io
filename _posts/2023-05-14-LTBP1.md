# Information about gene LTBP1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** LTBP1 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1) is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q22.3).
- **Pathology:** Mutations in LTBP1 have been associated with several diseases, including Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), geleophysic dysplasia (GD), and acromicric dysplasia.
- **Function:** LTBP1 encodes a glycoprotein that belongs to the family of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It binds to and regulates the activity of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which plays a vital role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. LTBP1 is involved in the transport and/or deposition of TGF-β in the extracellular matrix.
