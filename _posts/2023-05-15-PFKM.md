# Gene Information for PFKM

## Pathology
PFKM gene is associated with Glycolysis. Glycogen Storage Disease type VII which is also known as Tarui disease is caused by the mutation in this gene.

## Function
PFKM gene encodes a muscle specific isoform of phosphofructokinase enzyme. It is responsible for the regulation of the glycolytic pathway.

## External IDs and Genomic location
- HGNC ID: 8874
- NCBI Gene ID: 5213
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000102144
- OMIM ID: 610681
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P08237
- Genomic Position: Chr12, 10.64Mb

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- T383A (rs4544)
- V596A (rs4755821)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.598G>A (rs1801161)
- c.1313G>T (rs4656460)

## Related disease
- Glycogen storage disease type VII (Tarui's Disease)

## Treatment and prognosis
PFKM Deficiency is treated symptomatically. Gene therapy is considered a potential treatment for Tarui disease.

## Drug response
There are no specific drugs currently available for PFKM associated disorders.
