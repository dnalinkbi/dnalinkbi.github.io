## Gene Information for ITGAM

### Genetic Position

- Chromosome: 16q12.2
- Start position: 56,753,620 bp
- End position: 56,794,524 bp

### Function

The ITGAM gene encodes a protein called Integrin alpha M (ITGAM), also known as CD11b, which is a part of the integrin family of proteins. Integrins are involved in cell adhesion, aggregation, and migration. Specifically, ITGAM is expressed on the surface of immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, where it plays a role in leukocyte adhesion and migration, phagocytosis, and host defense against pathogens.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

The following is a list of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) in the ITGAM gene, along with their dbSNP ID:

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| -------------|----------|
| SNV | rs13047663 |
| SNV | rs3740878 |
| InDel | rs369636597 |
| SNV | rs555570668 |

### Related Disease

Mutations or dysregulation of the ITGAM gene have been associated with a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including:

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Atherosclerosis

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments targeting ITGAM for the diseases associated with its dysregulation. However, drugs targeting downstream molecules involved in ITGAM-mediated leukocyte adhesion and migration, such as integrin antagonists or anti-inflammatory drugs, may be effective in managing symptoms and controlling disease progression.

### Drug Response

Several studies have investigated the effect of ITGAM genetic variants on drug response and toxicity. For example, the ITGAM rs1143679 variant has been associated with an increased risk of methotrexate toxicity in RA patients, while the rs1143678 and rs1143683 variants have been linked to improved response to rituximab in the same population.
