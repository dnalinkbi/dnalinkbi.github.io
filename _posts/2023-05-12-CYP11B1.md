## Gene Information

**Gene**: CYP11B1

**Function**: The CYP11B1 gene encodes for an enzyme called 11-beta hydroxylase which plays a crucial role in steroid hormone synthesis pathway. It is involved in the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol in the adrenal cortex.

**External IDs**: HGNC: 2608, NCBI Entrez: 1584, Ensembl: ENSG00000134400, OMIM: 124085, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P15538

**Genomic Location**: Chromosome 8q21.3

**Aliases**: P450c11B1, CYP11B, CYP11B1V1, CPB1

## Mutations

**AA Mutation List**: The most common mutations observed in the CYP11B1 gene are missense mutations and include p.Arg448Trp, p.Arg448Gln and p.Arg374Cys.

**Mutation Type**: Missense mutations

**dbSNP ID**: rs121908182, rs121908183, rs121908184

**Somatic SNVs/InDels**: There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the CYP11B1 gene can cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) which is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by reduced cortisol production and excess androgen production. CAH can lead to a variety of adverse health outcomes including feminization in males, virilization in females, and inappropriate sexual development in both sexes.

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment of CAH primarily involves the replacement of deficient hormones and active management of excess hormone production. The prognosis for CAH is generally good with proper management, however, individuals with this condition may be at increased risk for fertility problems and other health complications later in life.

## Drug Response

CAH can be treated using glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone replacement therapy to manage hormone deficiencies caused by the condition. These treatments have proven to be effective in improving the health outcomes of individuals with CAH.
