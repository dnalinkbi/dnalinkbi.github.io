## Gene: DEPDC5

### Information

- Genetic position: Chromosome 22, q12.1.
- Pathology: Pathogenic variants of the DEPDC5 gene have been associated with familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), and sporadic and familial epilepsies with focal onset seizures.
- Function: The DEPDC5 gene, also known as DEP domain-containing protein 5, encodes a protein that is part of the GATOR1 complex, which negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway. The mTORC1 pathway is essential for the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. DEPDC5 plays a crucial role in maintaining proper cellular homeostasis and preventing the onset of seizures.

### Related Diseases

- Familial Focal Epilepsy with Variable Foci (FFEVF)
- Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE)
- Sporadic and Familial Epilepsies with Focal Onset Seizures

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for DEPDC5-related epilepsies typically involves the use of anticonvulsant medications. However, some cases may be resistant to treatment, and surgical intervention may be necessary. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the epilepsy and the effectiveness of the treatment.

### Drug Response

Studies have shown that some DEPDC5-related epilepsies may respond well to treatment with mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin.
