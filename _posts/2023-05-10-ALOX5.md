# Gene Information for ALOX5

## Function
ALOX5 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase) is a gene that encodes an enzyme which is involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are bioactive lipid mediators involved in inflammation, asthma, and other allergic reactions.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- Gene ID: 240
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10 (10q11.2)
- Aliases: 5-LOX, 5-lipoxygenase

## External Sites
- HGNC: 432
- NCBI Entrez: 240
- Ensembl: ENSG00000142168
- OMIM: 152390
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09917

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known AA (amino acid) mutations for ALOX5:
- V290M (rs10507391)
- R402Q (rs11604207)
- D519G (rs222808)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several known somatic SNVs/InDels (Single Nucleotide Variants/Insertions and Deletions) for ALOX5:
- rs58488150
- rs3729887

## Related Disease
ALOX5 has been implicated in several disease states, including:
- Asthma
- Allergic rhinitis
- Cardiovascular disease
- Cancer
- Alzheimer's disease
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are no specific treatments targeted toward ALOX5 as of yet. Prognosis is dependent on the underlying disease state associated with ALOX5 dysfunction.

## Drug Response
Some drugs that target ALOX5 include:
- Zileuton (anti-asthmatic)
- Aminoguanidine (neuroprotective in Alzheimer's Disease)
