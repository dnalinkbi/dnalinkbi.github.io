## Gene NDST4

### Genetic Position

NDST4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q25).

### Pathology

Mutations in the NDST4 gene have been linked to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

### Function

NDST4 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are molecules that play an important role in cell signaling and adhesion.

### External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: 17767 
- NCBI Entrez ID: 92124 
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000138677 
- OMIM ID: 609379 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q96L73

Aliases: NDST-4, N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase 4, heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 4.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There is a missense mutation in the NDST4 gene, a C to T substitution, at position 583 in the coding sequence leading to a change in amino acid from alanine to valine. It is also known as rs7204477.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic mutations in the NDST4 gene that have been identified in various types of cancer. One example is a missense mutation, a C to G substitution, at position 1755 in the coding sequence leading to a change in amino acid from threonine to arginine. It is also known as rs141506092.

### Related Disease

Mutations in NDST4 have been associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no specific treatment available for NDST4 mutations. Prognosis depends on the severity of the cancer and response to treatment.

### Drug response

There is no known drug response specifically related to NDST4 mutations.
