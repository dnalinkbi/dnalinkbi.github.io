# Information about Gene KMT2A

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 11q23.3
- **Pathology:** Chromosomal translocations affecting KMT2A gene are a frequent cause of acute leukemia. 
- **Function:** KMT2A gene encodes a histone methyltransferase that is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression through histone methylation. 

## Additional Information

- **External IDs:** HGNC: 6399, NCBI Entrez: 4297, Ensembl: ENSG00000118058, OMIM: 159555, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q03164
- **Aliases:** ALL1, MLL, CXXC7, HRX

## Genetic Variations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several mutations reported in KMT2A gene, some of which are synonymous and others are missense mutations. Some of the missense mutations with dbSNP ID are:

    - rs1057519841: p.Arg420His
    - rs201990369: p.Arg387His
    - rs121908277: p.Val49Ala

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Although KMT2A gene is commonly affected by chromosomal translocations, there are few reports of somatic SNVs/InDels in this gene. One example is:

    - rs1057519812 : c.3406C>T (p.Ala1136Val)

## Related Disease
- **Disease:** Leukemia
- **Association:** Chromosomal translocations involving KMT2A gene are commonly found in acute leukemia and are indicative of a poor prognosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for leukemia largely depend on the type and severity of the disease. KMT2A-rearranged leukemia is generally associated with a poor prognosis regardless of treatment approach. 
- According to recent studies, targeting KMT2A fusion proteins with epigenetic modulators and proteasome inhibitors could offer new therapeutic options.

## Drug Response
- The treatment options for KMT2A-rearranged leukemia are limited and current therapies are not very effective. Studies have shown that epigenetic modulators and proteasome inhibitors can be effective against KMT2A-rearranged leukemia, but more research is needed in this area.
