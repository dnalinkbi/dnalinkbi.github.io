# Gene Information: ARSG

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: 17q24.3

## Function
- ARSG gene codes for an enzyme that participates in the degradation of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, which are components of cartilage and other connective tissues. It is also involved in the regulation of inflammation and the immune response.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:25610
- NCBI Entrez ID: 116986
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000125843
- OMIM ID: 610272
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q8WUJ3
- Alias: Chss1, C3orf15, FLJ12990

## AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID
- No AA mutations have been reported for ARSG in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for ARSG in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
- No diseases have been directly linked to mutations in ARSG. However, changes in ARSG expression levels have been associated with certain diseases such as osteoarthritis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
