## Gene function

The CALR gene encodes for the protein calreticulin, which is a calcium-binding chaperone located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calreticulin serves multiple functions in the cell, such as protein folding, quality control, and calcium homeostasis.

## Related diseases

CALR mutations have been implicated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, including essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mutations are usually somatic and result in a gain-of-function effect, resulting in aberrant activation of signal transduction pathways.

## Treatment and prognosis

CALR mutation status has prognostic significance in PMF, with patients who have CALR mutations typically having better survival outcomes than those with JAK2 mutations or triple-negative status. JAK inhibitors are a common treatment for CALR-mutated PMF. In AML, CALR mutations have been associated with a favorable prognosis.

## Drug response

CALR mutations have been shown to confer sensitivity to certain drugs, such as imatinib and ruxolitinib.
