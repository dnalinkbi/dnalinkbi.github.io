# Information about gene EDA

## Genetic position

EDA (Ectodysplasin A) is a gene located on the X chromosome. Its genomic location is Xq12-q13.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in the EDA gene are associated with ectodermal dysplasia, which is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of hair, teeth, nails, and sweat glands.

## Function

The EDA gene provides instructions for producing a protein called ectodysplasin A, which is involved in the development of ectodermal structures. This protein is important for the formation of hair, teeth, nails, and sweat glands. It is also involved in the development of other organs, such as the mammary gland and the immune system.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- p.Arg156Ter: frameshift mutation that results in a premature stop codon (dbSNP ID: rs28935495)
- p.Arg289His: missense mutation that changes an amino acid from arginine to histidine (dbSNP ID: rs121908792)
- p.Val336Met: missense mutation that changes an amino acid from valine to methionine (dbSNP ID: rs121908793)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the EDA gene in dbSNP.

## Related disease

Mutations in the EDA gene are associated with X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED), which is a genetic disorder that affects the development of ectodermal structures.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is no cure for XLHED, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms. Treatment may include dental implants, artificial tears, and sweat gland transplantation. The prognosis for XLHED depends on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug response

There are currently no drugs specifically designed for the treatment of XLHED.
