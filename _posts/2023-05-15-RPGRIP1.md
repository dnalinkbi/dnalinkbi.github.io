# Information about Gene RPGRIP1

## Genetic Position
RPGRIP1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q11.2)

## Pathology
RPGRIP1 mutations have been linked to several conditions, including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and Leber congenital amaurosis.

## Function
RPGRIP1 encodes a protein that is important in the functioning of cilia - structures on the surface of cells that are involved in cell signalling, movement, and sensing.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 18622
- NCBI Entrez: 57096 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100376 
- OMIM: 605446 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96KN7 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly165Ser (missense), rs372367808
- p.Gln154* (nonsense), rs367832296

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported.

## Related Disease
RPGRIP1 mutations are associated with several types of inherited retinal degeneration, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cone rod dystrophy (CRD), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for RPGRIP1-related retinal degeneration. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. In severe cases, a retinal prosthesis may be considered.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response in individuals with RPGRIP1-related retinal degeneration.
