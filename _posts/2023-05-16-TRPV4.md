# Gene Information

## Gene TRPV4
The TRPV4 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4. This gene is located on chromosome 12q24.1 and is comprised of 15 exons.

## Function 
The TRPV4 protein is a calcium-permeable cation channel that plays a fundamental role in several physiological processes, including osmotic regulation, mechanosensation, and thermosensation. It also contributes to the regulation of water and glucose homeostasis.

## Related Disease 
There are several diseases associated with mutations in the TRPV4 gene, including:
- Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 2C (HMSN2C)
- Brachyolmia type 3
- Metatropic dysplasia

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with mutations in the TRPV4 gene vary depending on the specific condition and severity.

## Drug Response
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that specifically target TRPV4. However, there are ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of TRPV4 inhibitors in various conditions.
