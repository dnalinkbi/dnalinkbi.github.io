#NLGN1 Gene Information

## Gene Position, Pathology,and Function
- **Position:** NLGN1 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 26.3
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the NLGN1 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. 
- **Function:** NLGN1 encodes for a protein that is involved in synaptic function and neuronal communication.
