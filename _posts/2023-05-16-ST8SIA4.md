# Gene: ST8SIA4
---

## Genetic Position
The gene ST8SIA4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 at the position 12q12.

## Pathology
Mutations in ST8SIA4 have been associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

## Function
The ST8SIA4 gene encodes a protein called GD3 synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of gangliosides, a type of glycolipid found on the surface of cells. Gangliosides have diverse roles in cell signaling and are particularly abundant in brain tissue.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known mutations in ST8SIA4 that are associated with diseases. However, the NCBI ClinVar database lists several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene. Some of these SNPs are:

- rs1794197: A missense mutation resulting in a substitution of arginine with cysteine at amino acid position 211 (R211C).
- rs17805455: A synonymous mutation (G225G).
- rs235050: A missense mutation causing an alanine to threonine substitution at amino acid position 238 (A238T).
- rs12734285: Another synonymous mutation (E295E).

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no known somatic mutations in ST8SIA4 with a dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease
- Alzheimer's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, but various treatments are available to manage their symptoms. DM1, a sialyltransferase inhibitor, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.

## Drug Response
DM1 has been shown to reduce the production of amyloid beta, a protein that forms aggregates in the brain, in Alzheimer's disease models.
