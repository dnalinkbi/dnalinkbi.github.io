# Gene B3GNT8

## Genetic Position

Gene B3GNT8 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 at position 11q12.3.

## Pathology

Studies have shown that B3GNT8 is not linked to any genetic disorder or disease pathology.

## Function

B3GNT8 encodes a protein that belongs to the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a sugar moiety from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The protein is involved in the biosynthesis of complex glycosphingolipids that are essential for cell-cell recognition and communication.
