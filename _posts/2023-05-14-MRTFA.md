## Gene: MRTFA

- Function for gene: 
The MRTFA gene encodes a protein called Myocardin-related transcription factor A, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the MRTFA gene. Some of these mutations with their dbSNP ID are listed below:

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|---------------|----------|
| SNV           | rs113994088|
| SNV           | rs113994089|
| SNV           | rs115447593|

- Related disease:
Mutations in the MRTFA gene are associated with Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS).

- Treatment and prognosis:
Management of MMIHS is supportive and may include total parenteral nutrition, decompression of the dilated urinary tract, and surgical interventions. Prognosis varies depending upon the severity of the condition.

- Drug response:
There is no reported drug response based on MRTFA mutations.
