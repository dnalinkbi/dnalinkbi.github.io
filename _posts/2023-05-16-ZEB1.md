# Information about Gene ZEB1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** ZEB1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22.1).
- **Pathology:** ZEB1 has been implicated in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer.
- **Function:** ZEB1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is important in embryonic development and cancer progression. It regulates the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and migration, as well as those involved in the maintenance of stem cells.

## Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases

- **Gene Name:** ZEB1

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- No AA mutations have been reported for ZEB1 in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels reported for ZEB1 in cancer include:
  - rs387907171 (p.R189W) - breast cancer
  - rs376124872 (p.L344F) - ovarian cancer
  - rs372092619 (p.R431H) - pancreatic cancer

## Related Disease

- ZEB1 is associated with the following diseases:
  - Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 6
  - Corneal endothelial dystrophy 2
  - Corneal dystrophy, posterior polymorphous, 3
  - Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy 3 with cataract

## Treatment and Prognosis

- The treatment and prognosis for ZEB1-associated diseases depend on the specific condition.
- In some cases, treatments may include medications, surgery, or corneal transplantation.
- Prognosis also varies but is generally better for milder forms of corneal dystrophy.

## Drug Response

- Studies have shown that ZEB1 may be an important target for cancer treatment, and several drugs that target ZEB1 are currently being developed.
- For example, one study found that an anti-ZEB1 monoclonal antibody was able to inhibit tumor growth in mice with breast cancer.
