## Gene: CACNA2D1

### Information
- **Position:** Chromosome 7 (7q21.11)
- **Pathology:** Associated with neurological disorders such as epilepsy, bipolar disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease.
- **Function:** Encodes for voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1, which is involved in calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release.

### Identifiers
- **Gene ID:** 773 (NCBI Entrez)
- **Aliases:** Alpha-2/delta subunit 1, CACNA2D

### Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** There are multiple AA mutations listed for CACNA2D1, but some of the most studied ones include:
    - R972C (rs104893771): Missense mutation leading to a change in a positively charged amino acid, causing a change in channel kinetics and reduced calcium influx.
    - R1438C (rs121918237): Missense mutation leading to altered protein structure and trafficking, associated with autistic spectrum disorders and epilepsy.
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs104893771, rs121918237

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
- There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for CACNA2D1.

### Related Diseases
- Epilepsy
- Bipolar Disorder
