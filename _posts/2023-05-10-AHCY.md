## Gene AHCY
### Information
- **Genetic Position:** chr20:50,096,240-50,124,724
- **Pathology:** No known pathology associated with gene AHCY
- **Function:** AHCY gene encodes S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the regulation of adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a potent feedback inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases. Therefore, AHCY regulates the levels of SAM and SAH, which affect the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
