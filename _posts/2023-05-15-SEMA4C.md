## Information about gene SEMA4C

**Genetic Position:** SEMA4C gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.32)^[1]^.

**Pathology:** SEMA4C is associated with various pathological conditions including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders^[2]^.

**Function:** SEMA4C encodes for a protein belonging to the semaphorin family that regulates the growth and development of neurons by interacting with its receptor, plexin-B2^[3]^.
