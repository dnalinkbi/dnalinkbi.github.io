## Gene AXIN1

- **Function:** The AXIN1 gene encodes a protein that acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 908
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 8312
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105974
    - OMIM: 603816
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15169
    - Aliases: AXIN, AXIN1D, PPP1R49

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
Some of the reported mutations in the AXIN1 gene are:

| Mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| p.Pro554Leu | Missense | rs757011357 |
| p.Ile669Met | Missense | rs121913373 |
| p.Arg530* | Nonsense | rs1554929520 |
| p.Lys843Glu | Missense | rs137853361 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
Several somatic mutations have been found in the AXIN1 gene in various types of cancer, including colorectal, hepatocellular, and endometrial cancer. Some of the reported mutations are:

| Mutation | Cancer Type | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| p.Glu17Lys | Colorectal | rs201202295 |
| p.Ala286Thr | Colorectal | rs797045501 |
| p.Gly410Arg | Colorectal | rs1057518944 |
| p.Val262Gly | Hepatocellular | rs757464255 |

- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the AXIN1 gene have been associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and endometrial cancer.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for cancer patients with AXIN1 mutations may vary depending on the cancer type, stage, and other factors. However, studies have suggested that AXIN1 mutations may be associated with a more favorable prognosis in some cases.

- **Drug Response:** Some studies have suggested that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway, which is regulated by AXIN1, may be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, more research is needed to develop targeted therapies for cancer patients with AXIN1 mutations.
