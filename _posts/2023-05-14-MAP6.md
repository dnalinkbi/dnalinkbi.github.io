# Gene MAP6

## Genetic Position 
MAP6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q21.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in MAP6 have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, MAP6 expression in the brain is decreased, leading to the formation of tau tangles. 

## Function
MAP6 encodes a microtubule-associated protein that regulates microtubule dynamics, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity.

## External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 4134
- HGNC: 6842
- Ensembl: ENSG00000147133
- OMIM: 157182
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P47756
- Aliases: STOP, MAP6D1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations in MAP6 associated with different neurodegenerative diseases:
- c.268G>A (p.Arg90His) - rs145933900
- c.536A>G (p.Tyr179Cys) - rs886037857
- c.697C>T (p.Arg233Cys) - rs146305190
- c.1256G>T (p.Ala419Ser) - rs745059985

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic mutations reported for MAP6 in dbSNP.

## Related Diseases
- Alzheimer's disease
- Huntington's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for neurodegenerative diseases associated with MAP6 mutations. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms. The prognosis is generally poor, as these diseases are progressive and debilitating.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs specifically targeting MAP6. However, drugs used to treat Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease may provide some symptom relief.
