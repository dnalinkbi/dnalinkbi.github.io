# Gene FCGR3B

## Information
- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 1 (1q23.3)
- **Pathology**: FCGR3B gene is associated with various diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV, and malaria.
- **Function**: This gene encodes a receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG), which plays a crucial role in the immune response. The encoded protein is involved in phagocytosis, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
