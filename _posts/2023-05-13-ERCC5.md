## Gene ERCC5

### Genetic Position

The ERCC5 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 13 at position 14.3.

### Pathology

Mutations in ERCC5 are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XP-G), a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight and an increased risk of skin cancer.

### Function

The ERCC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called XPG, which plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA. Specifically, XPG is involved in a process called nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is responsible for removing DNA damage caused by UV radiation and certain chemicals.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

The following mutations have been reported in the ERCC5 gene:
- c.1768A>G (p.Asn590Ser) - rs137853046
- c.1895C>T (p.Arg632Ter) - rs374018122
- c.2543C>T (p.Arg848Cys) - rs200196822
- c.2899C>T (p.Arg967*) - rs104894066
- c.3474C>T (p.Arg1158*) - rs104894163

These mutations are all single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and they are associated with XP-G.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

The following ERCC5 somatic variants have been reported in dbSNP:
- rs104894067 (c.634G>A; p.Arg212His)
- rs104894068 (c.2015G>A; p.Val672Met)
- rs104894071 (c.2983C>T; p.Arg995Cys)

### Related Disease

Mutations in ERCC5 are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XP-G), a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for XP-G, but prompt and careful management of sun exposure can prevent skin damage and reduce the risk of skin cancer.

### Drug Response

There is currently no targeted drug therapy for XP-G, but several chemotherapeutic agents have been used to treat skin cancer associated with XP-G.
