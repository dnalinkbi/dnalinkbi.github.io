# Gene: MAD1L1

## Genetic Position
MAD1L1 is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 at position 22.1.

## Pathology 
MAD1L1 has been associated with a number of different types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function 
MAD1L1 encodes a protein known as mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD1, which plays an important role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division.
