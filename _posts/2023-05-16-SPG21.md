# Information about gene SPG21

**Genetic position:** SPG21 is located on the chromosome 15q21.1.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the gene SPG21 are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). HSP is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the corticospinal tract, resulting in spasticity and weakness of the lower extremities.

**Function for gene:** SPG21 encodes for spartin, a protein that is involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of protein trafficking and degradation, vesicle transport, and lipid metabolism.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
- HGNC: 11204 
- NCBI Entrez: 27072 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000140374 
- OMIM: 604867 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q6P4F2

Aliases for SPG21 include Maspardin, Paraplegin-4, SPG21P1.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.Arg347Ter (rs587782634)
- p.Glu222Lys (rs56101232)
- p.Asp396Asn (rs368367540)

Mutation type: Missense, Nonsense.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related disease:** Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for HSP, and treatment is primarily symptomatic, involving physical therapy, rehabilitation, and assistive devices. The prognosis for HSP varies, but in general, it is a slowly progressive disorder that can lead to significant disability in some patients.

**Drug response:** There are no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of HSP, but some medications, such as baclofen and tizanidine, may provide symptomatic relief for spasticity.
