# Information about gene TUBGCP6

## Genetic Position
The gene TUBGCP6 is located on chromosome 17q25.3. It spans a total of 105.2 kb and has 26 exons.

## Pathology and Function
TUBGCP6 encodes for the protein gamma-tubulin complex component 6. This protein is a core component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation in eukaryotic cells. The γTuRC serves as a platform for the polymerization of tubulin dimers to form microtubules. Dysregulation of TUBGCP6 expression or function has been associated with several diseases, including cancer and microcephaly.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (InDels) reported in TUBGCP6 in the dbSNP database. These include missense, synonymous, and splice-site mutations. 

Here are some examples of missense mutations in TUBGCP6:
- p.Gly413Arg (dbSNP ID: rs141319546)
- p.Asn122Ser (dbSNP ID: rs761530225)
- p.Arg732Trp (dbSNP ID: rs768322281)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in TUBGCP6 have been reported in various cancers, including breast and lung cancer. Here are some examples of somatic mutations:
- p.Asp717Asn (dbSNP ID: rs869025842)
- p.Gly104Arg (dbSNP ID: rs761580522)
- p.Arg350Gln (dbSNP ID: rs371693727)

## Related Disease
Dysregulation of TUBGCP6 has been associated with several diseases, including cancer and microcephaly. For example, TUBGCP6 is overexpressed in breast cancer and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. In microcephaly, mutations in genes that are involved in microtubule regulation, including TUBGCP6, may affect brain development.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments available for diseases associated with TUBGCP6 dysfunction. Prognosis depends on the specific disease and individual case.

## Drug Response
No information is available on drug response related to TUBGCP6.
