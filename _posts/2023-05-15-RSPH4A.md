## Information about gene RSPH4A

### Genetic Position

RSPH4A (Radial spoke head 4 homolog A) is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.2 (19q13.2).

### Pathology

Pathogenic mutations in RSPH4A have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of cilia.

### Function

RSPH4A encodes a protein that is a component of the radial spoke head in cilia. Radial spokes are critical for the proper alignment and motion of the microtubules that form the cilia.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP ID

There are several missense mutations in RSPH4A that have been associated with PCD. Some examples include:

| Mutation | Type   | dbSNP ID |
| ---------| ------ | -------- |
| p.Lys268Asn | Missense | rs267606860 |
| p.Thr283Ile | Missense | rs267606859 |
| p.Arg354Trp | Missense | rs267606858 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic mutations in RSPH4A.

### Related Disease

Pathogenic mutations in RSPH4A have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder that affects respiratory function, fertility, and situs inversus.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for PCD. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms of the disease, including respiratory infections, hearing loss, and infertility.

### Drug Response

There is currently no known drug response for mutations in RSPH4A.
