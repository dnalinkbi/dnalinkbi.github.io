# Information about Gene SLC15A1

## Genetic Position
The gene SLC15A1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q33.1). 

## Pathology
Mutations in the SLC15A1 gene are associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, a decrease in the expression of SLC15A1 has been linked with a poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

## Function
The SLC15A1 gene encodes a protein known as PEPT1, which is a transporter protein in the intestinal tract responsible for absorbing small peptides and peptide-like molecules. This gene plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients and maintenance of intestinal health.

## Related Disease
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Lung adenocarcinoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for inflammatory bowel disease or type 2 diabetes. Treatment for these conditions aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications. The prognosis for lung adenocarcinoma varies depending on the stage at which the cancer is diagnosed.

## Drug Response
SLC15A1 has been identified as a potential target for drugs used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. However, further research is necessary to develop effective therapies.
