## Gene Information for SPG25
### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
Symbol: SPG25

Name: Spastic paraplegia 25 (autosomal recessive, with a type of mental retardation)

Locus: Chromosome 8 (8q)

Pathology: SPG25 is a type of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness.

Function: SPG25 encodes the Protein Spastizin, which is involved in neuronal development and autophagy. Mutations in this gene cause neurodegeneration and abnormal neuronal development.
