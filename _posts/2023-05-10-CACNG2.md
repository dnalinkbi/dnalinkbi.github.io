# Information on Gene CACNG2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
Gene CACNG2 is located on chromosome 17q24 and encodes for a protein called stargazin. Stargazin is essential for the functional expression of AMPA receptors in the central nervous system and plays a role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. The gene has been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder.

- Autism spectrum disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments or targeted therapies for any of the diseases associated with CACNG2. Treatment is generally symptomatic and involves the use of antipsychotic or antidepressant medications. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited research on drug response in relation to CACNG2 mutations, but some studies have suggested that certain CACNG2 variants may affect the response to antipsychotic medications.
