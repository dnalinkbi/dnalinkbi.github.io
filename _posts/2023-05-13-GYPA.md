# Gene GYPA

## Genetic Position
The GYPA gene is located on chromosome 4q31.21.

## Pathology
Mutations in the GYPA gene are associated with blood group Gerbich system antigens and Gerbich-related blood groups.

## Function
The GYPA gene encodes for glycophorin A, which is a red blood cell membrane glycoprotein. It plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the red blood cell membrane.
