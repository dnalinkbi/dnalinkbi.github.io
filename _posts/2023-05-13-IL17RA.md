### Gene IL17RA

IL17RA gene encodes for interleukin 17 receptor A (IL-17RA) protein which is a member of the interleukin 17 receptor family. This protein is expressed in various tissues and plays a crucial role in immune response and inflammatory processes by binding to IL-17 cytokine family members.

#### Function

The function of IL17RA gene is to encode IL-17RA protein, which plays a crucial role in immune response and inflammatory processes by binding to IL-17 cytokine family members. It is involved in mediating the pro-inflammatory responses and autoimmunity.

#### Related disease

Mutations in the IL17RA gene are linked to various diseases such as psoriasis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis.

#### Treatment and prognosis

There are currently no specific treatments available for the mutation of IL17RA gene, but certain treatments such as anti-TNF-, IL-12/23, and IL-17 therapeutics are in development for treating related autoimmune diseases.

#### Drug response

Recent studies have found that anti-IL-17 therapies, such as Secukinumab, Ixekizumab, and Brodalumab, have shown to be effective in treating diseases caused by defective IL-17RA signaling, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.
