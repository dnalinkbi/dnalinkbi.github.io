## Gene: OPHN1
### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: X
- Location: Xq12
- Pathology: X-linked intellectual disability

### Function:
OPHN1 plays a crucial role in the development and plasticity of synaptic connections. It is involved in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology and the function of excitatory synapses.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC: 8496
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 4984
- Ensembl: ENSG00000130829
- OMIM: 300127
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60890

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
OPHN1 mutations have been identified as a cause of X-linked intellectual disability. Some of the identified missense mutations are:
- p.Arg178Gln (dbSNP ID: rs104894848)
- p.Arg132Trp (dbSNP ID: rs104894849)
- p.Arg43Cys (dbSNP ID: rs1554117057)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for OPHN1.

### Related Disease:
OPHN1 mutations have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability and syndromic cases of epileptic seizures.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no cure for X-linked intellectual disability caused by OPHN1 mutations. Treatment is usually supportive and includes educational interventions, behavioral therapy, and medication for associated symptoms such as seizures.

### Drug Response:
There is currently no specific drug that targets OPHN1 mutations directly. Treatment is usually focused on managing the symptoms associated with intellectual disability and seizures.
