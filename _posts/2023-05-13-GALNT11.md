# Gene Information for GALNT11

## Summary
The gene GALNT11 is located on chromosome 2q24.1, and it encodes a member of the UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family. This enzyme catalyzes the initial step in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, transferring an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue to a serine or threonine residue on the target protein. GALNT11 has been associated with various diseases and has potential implications in drug response.

## Function
As a member of the GalNAc-T family, GALNT11 catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to target proteins, initiating O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. This process can have many downstream effects on protein function and localization.

## Related Disease, Treatment, and Prognosis
GALNT11 has been implicated in various diseases. For example, it has been suggested that GALNT11 expression may play a role in breast cancer metastasis. Additionally, GALNT11 mutations have been associated with developmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Because of its involvement in disease pathways, GALNT11 has potential implications for drug response and prognosis, though further research is needed to explore these possibilities.

## Drug Response
There is currently limited information available regarding drug response and GALNT11. However, given its involvement in disease pathways, it is possible that GALNT11 could have implications for targeted therapies in the future.
