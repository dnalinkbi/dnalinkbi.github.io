# Information about gene DBH

## Genetic Position

The DBH gene is located on chromosome 9q34.2 and it spans 78.84 kb of genomic DNA. 

## Pathology

Variations in the DBH gene have been associated with several disorders, including:

- Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- Orthostatic hypotension

## Function

The DBH gene encodes dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine in the last step of the biosynthesis of catecholamines.

## External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC: 2682
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 1621
- Ensembl: ENSG00000136816
- OMIM: 223360
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09172

Aliases for DBH include dopamine beta-hydroxylase, dopamine beta-monooxygenase, and DBM.

## AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID

Several non-synonymous variations have been reported in the DBH gene. Some of these variations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs include:

- Gly266Ser (rs1611115)
- Ala317Val (rs6271)
- Asn52Ser (rs2519152)
- Asp290Asn (rs1611120)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have been identified in the DBH gene. These mutations are primarily missense variations and have different dbSNP IDs, including:

- Met108Ile (rs786205340)
- Gly336Asp (rs1558773432)
- Glu318Gly (rs1558773433)

## Related Disease

Variations in the DBH gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, including Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Orthostatic hypotension.

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment and prognosis of disorders associated with the DBH gene largely depend on the specific condition and its severity. In some cases, treatment may involve the use of medications to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

## Drug Response

Variations in the DBH gene may affect drug response to certain medications, particularly those used to treat hypertension and ADHD.
