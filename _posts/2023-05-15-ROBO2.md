# Information about Gene ROBO2 

## Genetic Position
ROBO2 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 12.3 (3q12.3). This gene spans 193.7 kb of genomic DNA and consists of 30 exons. 

## Pathology and Function 
The protein encoded by ROBO2 is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in controlling axon guidance during neuronal development. Robo2 is also found to act as a tumor suppressor gene in various types of cancer. Loss of function mutations or reduced expression of ROBO2 are associated with increased tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis.

## Related Diseases
The ROBO2 gene is associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. The mutations or altered expression of ROBO2 is known to play roles in the progression and metastatic spread of these cancers. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for ROBO2 mutations, and the treatment options depend on the type and stage of cancer. Patients with ROBO2 mutations or lower expression of ROBO2 may have a worse prognosis and a higher risk of poor outcomes. 

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that ROBO2 mutations may affect the response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs in cancer patients.
