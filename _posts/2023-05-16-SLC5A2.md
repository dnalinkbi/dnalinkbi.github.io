# Gene Information for SLC5A2

## Genetic Position
The SLC5A2 gene is located on chromosome 16 at the position q23.3.

## Pathology
Variations in the SLC5A2 gene are associated with different renal diseases. Mutations in the SLC5A2 gene can cause familial renal glycosuria, which is an inherited disorder characterized by the excretion of glucose in urine despite normal blood glucose levels. Additionally, SLC5A2 genetic variations are associated with the development of kidney stones and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

## Function
The SLC5A2 gene encodes a protein called sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is primarily responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney. SGLT2 inhibitors are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic variations in the SLC5A2 gene.

## Related Disease
- Familial renal glycosuria
- Kidney stones
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus

## Treatment and Prognosis
For familial renal glycosuria, treatment may not be necessary, as people with this condition can have a normal lifespan and no other complications. Treatment options for kidney stones include pain relief medication, drinking plenty of water, and in severe cases, surgery. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, SGLT2 inhibitors are used to lower blood glucose levels.

## Drug Response
SGLT2 inhibitors are approved drugs that block the actions of SGLT2, leading to reduced glucose reabsorption in the kidney. They are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.
