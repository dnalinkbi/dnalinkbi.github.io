# Gene SMO

## Genetic Position
The SMO gene is located on chromosome 7q32.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SMO gene have been linked to several types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and ovarian cancer.

## Function
SMO encodes for the Smoothened protein, which is a key component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway regulates cell growth and differentiation during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis. Smoothened is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates downstream signaling in response to binding of Hedgehog ligands.

## Related Disease
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Medulloblastoma
- Ovarian cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeted therapies that inhibit the Hedgehog signaling pathway, such as vismodegib and sonidegib, have been approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. The long-term prognosis of SMO-mutated cancer depends on the specific cancer type and stage.

## Drug Response
The efficacy of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors for SMO-mutated cancers can vary depending on the specific mutation and tumor context.
