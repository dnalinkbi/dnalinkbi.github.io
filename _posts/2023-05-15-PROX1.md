# Gene Information: PROX1

## Genetic Position:
The PROX1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.21.

## Pathology:
The PROX1 gene is linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer, lymphedema, and developmental disorders.

## Function:
The PROX1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor and plays a vital role in cell differentiation, development, and lymphatic vessel formation.
