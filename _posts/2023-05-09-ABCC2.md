# Gene ABCC2 Information

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The ABCC2 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 2) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q24.2). This gene encodes a protein called multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) that is involved in the transport of various substrates across cell membranes. MRP2 is primarily expressed in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney, brain, and intestine.

Several mutations in the ABCC2 gene have been associated with various pathologies, including Dubin-Johnson syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired organic anion transport and jaundice. ABCC2 mutations have also been linked to increased susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury.

## Function for Gene
The ABCC2 gene encodes multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), which is involved in the transport of various substrates, including drugs, across cell membranes. MRP2 is known to play a critical role in the excretion of bilirubin and other organic anions from the liver into bile.

## Related Diseases
- Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (OMIM: #237500)
- Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis 2 (OMIM: #601847)
- Drug-Induced Liver Injury (OMIM: #614156)

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of ABCC2-related diseases depend on the severity of the specific condition. Treatment for Dubin-Johnson syndrome typically involves managing symptoms, such as jaundice, while drug-induced liver injury requires immediate discontinuation of the offending drug and supportive care.

## Drug Response
Various drugs have been shown to be substrates of MRP2, including anticancer agents, antibiotics, and antiviral drugs. ABCC2 mutations can alter the function of MRP2 and affect drug response.
