## Information on gene MYCL

### Genetic Position
- MYCL is located on chromosome 1 at 1p34.2. 

### Pathology
- MYCL amplifications and overexpression have been associated with several cancer types, including neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. 
- MYCL amplification is also a negative prognostic factor in neuroblastoma.

### Function
- MYCL is a member of the MYC family of transcription factors, which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. 
- MYCL specifically plays a role in the development of neural crest cells, which give rise to the peripheral nervous system. 

### External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 4610
- HGNC ID: 7595
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000117283
- OMIM ID: 189980
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P12524
- Other aliases: bHLHe38, LMYC, MYCL1, MYN

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported for MYCL in the COSMIC database, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. 
- Examples of some mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:
    - p.Y267D, rs116155333
    - p.Q68*, rs1567926679
    - p.F31fs, rs1567926109

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- The COSMIC database also contains information on somatic SNVs/InDels in MYCL from various cancer types. 
- Examples of some mutations with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:
    - c.38-42delTCACT, rs587776839
    - c.211G>A, rs1553887970
    - c.323G>A, rs1567926708 

### Related Disease
- MYCL amplification and overexpression have been associated with several cancer types, including neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. 
- Neuroblastoma patients with MYCL amplification have a poorer prognosis. 

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment strategies for MYCL-amplified cancers are still being developed, and prognosis can vary depending on the cancer type and stage. 
- Some studies have suggested that MYCL amplification may confer resistance to certain chemotherapy agents.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information on drug response specifically related to MYCL.
