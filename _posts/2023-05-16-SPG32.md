# Gene Information for SPG32

## Gene function
The SPG32 gene encodes for a protein called FAM46D which plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability and cell cycle progression.

## External IDs and Genomic location
- HGNC: 28438
- NCBI Entrez: 84255
- Ensembl: ENSG00000136135
- OMIM: 609342
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9P239
- Genomic location: Chromosome 2q33.1

## AA mutation list and mutation types with dbSNP ID
- c.541C>T (p.Thr181Met); rs118203917
- c.1121G>A (p.Gly374Ser); rs780368911

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported for SPG32.

## Related diseases
Variants in the SPG32 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 32 (SPG32). This is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs.

## Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for SPG32, and treatment is mainly supportive. Physical therapy and assistive devices may be helpful in managing symptoms.

## Drug response
There is no known drug treatment for SPG32.
