# Gene: SIM1

SIM1 is a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 6. It encodes for a transcription factor that plays a critical role in development and maintenance of the central nervous system.

## Function for gene

SIM1 is primarily involved in the development and regulation of specific neurons within the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and energy expenditure. It also regulates the development of other neuroendocrine and autonomic neurons throughout the brainstem, spinal cord and retina.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are several known missense mutations in SIM1 that lead to functional impairment, including:

- p.Gly374Ser (rs121908758)
- p.Arg403Cys (rs1555262440)
- p.Pro469Leu (rs104894390)
- p.Arg669Ter (rs1554713507)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic SNVs/InDels in SIM1 have been identified in various cancers, including:

- c.422T>A (rs201987522)
- c.764A>C (rs200932438)

## Related disease

Mutations in SIM1 have been associated with early-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, and Prader-Willi-like syndrome. Additionally, recent studies have suggested a possible role for SIM1 in the development of certain forms of cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment for SIM1-associated disorders typically involves management of symptoms, such as dietary and exercise interventions for obesity and hormone therapy for hypothalamic dysfunction. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder and degree of symptom management.

## Drug response

There is currently no known drug therapy specifically targeting SIM1.
