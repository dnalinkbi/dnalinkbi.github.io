## Gene IGK

The IGK gene codes for the immunoglobulin kappa light chain, a type of protein involved in the immune response. The protein is expressed in B cells and is involved in the recognition and neutralization of foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses.

### Function

The main function of the IGK gene is to encode the immunoglobulin kappa light chain, which is a component of antibodies produced by B cells. The light chains pair with heavy chains to form the complex structure of an antibody that can recognize and bind to specific foreign molecules in the body.

### External IDs and Genomic Location

- HGNC ID: HGNC:5455
- NCBI Entrez ID: 3518
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000137293
- OMIM ID: 147200
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P01834

The IGK gene is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2p11.2.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are many mutations associated with the IGK gene, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other types of variations. Below is a list of some of the amino acid (AA) mutations associated with the IGK gene, along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Ser/Asn | SNP | rs1803274 |
| Thr/Met | SNP | rs1803275 |
| Val/Ala | SNP | rs1803276 |
| Thr/Ile | SNP | rs1803277 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs (single nucleotide variations) and InDels (insertion/deletion) associated with the IGK gene. Some of these variations include:

- rs61746198: C/T somatic variant in colorectal cancer
- rs772394482: TTA/T somatic variant in lung carcinoma

### Related Disease

The IGK gene mutations have been associated with various diseases, including:

- Autoimmune diseases
- Hematologic malignancies
- Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

### Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment options for diseases associated with the IGK gene mutations vary depending on the specific condition and severity of the symptoms. For example, CLL may be treated with chemotherapy or targeted therapy. In cases of MGUS, regular monitoring may be recommended to watch for any progression to a more serious condition.

In general, the prognosis for conditions associated with IGK mutations depends on the specific disease, stage of progression, and individual factors such as age and overall health.

### Drug Response

Some drugs have been developed that target the immune system and may be effective in treating conditions associated with IGK gene mutations. For example, rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets B cells and has been used to treat CLL.
