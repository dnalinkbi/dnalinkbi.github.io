# Information on Gene MCEE

## Genetic position, Pathology, and Function

- The gene MCEE is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q33.1 and is associated with various diseases based on its pathology and function.
- It is involved in the hydrolysis of S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine and is thus a part of the methionine salvage pathway that recycles the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine.
- This gene is also implicated in several cellular processes such as gene expression regulation and maintenance of genomic integrity.

## Function of gene

- The MCEE gene encodes the protein S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), which plays a vital role in the methionine cycle.
- SAHH catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) to produce L-homocysteine and adenosine.
- SAHH is also involved in the maintenance of cellular and genomic integrity as it regulates DNA methylation through its role in the methionine cycle.

## Related Disease

- MCEE gene mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with a variety of diseases, including liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
- SAHH deficiency is also associated with a rare metabolic disorder known as hypermethioninemia.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for diseases associated with the MCEE gene depend on the specific condition and its severity.
- For SAHH deficiency, treatment involves a low-methionine diet, medication, and dietary supplements to prevent vitamin deficiencies.
- Most of the diseases associated with MCEE have a moderate prognosis and can be managed with proper treatment.

## Drug Response

- Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting the MCEE gene. However, treatments for related diseases may involve drugs that target other pathways or aspects of the disease.
