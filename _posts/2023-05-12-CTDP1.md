# Information about Gene CTDP1

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic position:** CTDP1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q23) in humans.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in the CTDP1 gene lead to an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder called Congenital Cataracts, Facial Dysmorphism, and Neuropathy (CCFDN). 

- **Function:** The CTDP1 gene encodes for a phosphatase enzyme called carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1). CTDSP1 is involved in RNA transcription and gene expression regulation by dephosphorylating the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II.

## Other information

- **External IDs:** The gene has the following external IDs: 
    - HGNC: HGNC:2509
    - NCBI Entrez: 9152
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000130600
    - OMIM: 604927
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5S2

- **Aliases:** The gene is also known by the following aliases:
    - CTD (CARBOXY-TERMINAL DOMAIN, RNA POLYMERASE II, POLYPEPTIDE A SMALL PHOSPHATASE 1)
    - FCMDP (FACIOCRANIAL DYSPLASIA AND POLYNEUROPATHY)
    - CTDNEP1 (CTD NUCLEOSOME ASSOCIATED PHOSPHATASE 1)

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are many mutations in the CTDP1 gene that are associated with CCFDN. The following table lists some of the reported mutations along with the mutation type and dbSNP ID (where available).

    | Amino Acid change | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Arg232Ser | Missense | rs587782506 |
    | Gly626Ala | Missense | rs118203619 |
    | Gly731Asp | Missense | rs371587876 |
    | c.1190_1191delGA | Frameshift | rs1554130899 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no somatic mutations currently reported for the CTDP1 gene in dbSNP.

- **Related disease:** CCFDN is the only known disease associated with CTDP1 gene mutations.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no cure for CCFDN, and treatment is targeted at managing the symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

- **Drug response:** There are no known drugs that specifically target CTDP1 gene mutations.
