# Analysis of Gene LGI2

## Gene Information
- Gene Name: LGI2
- Genomic Location: 4q25
- Function: LGI2 encodes leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 2 protein which is involved in the development and function of the nervous system.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6618
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 9212
- Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000138727
- OMIM: 611021
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95970
- Aliases: FLJ21642, Leucine-Rich Glioma-Inactivated Protein 2, MGC12635

## Variants and Mutations
- AA Mutation List:
  - p.Ser346Leu
  - p.Ala528Thr
  - p.Val610Leu
- Mutation Types: Missense Variants
- dbSNP IDs: rs142593864, rs281864631, rs797044390

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP IDs: rs149423999, rs72633511

## Related Disease
- LGI2 mutations are associated with Autosomal Recessive Spastic Paraplegia Type 67 (SPG67), which is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and elevated reflexes of the lower limbs.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for SPG67. Treatment mainly focuses on managing the symptoms and may include physical therapy, muscle relaxants, and braces. The prognosis for individuals with SPG67 varies but in most cases, the condition slowly progresses.

## Drug Response
- There is no known drug that specifically targets LGI2 mutations or SPG67.
