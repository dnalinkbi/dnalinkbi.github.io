## Gene NAIP
NAIP stands for "NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein". This gene is located on chromosome 5q13.1. NAIP is known to function in the inhibition of apoptosis, which is the programmed cell death of damaged or unnecessary cells. 

### Function
The NAIP gene is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. It is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses, specifically in the inhibition of inflammatory signalling pathways through its anti-apoptotic functions.

Aliases for NAIP include BIRC1, NLRB1, and BIRC2. 

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several variants reported for NAIP. Some of the commonly reported ones are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported for NAIP as well. Some of them with their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | dbSNP ID |
| -------- | -------- |
| p.Ala408Gly | rs113169155 |
| c.372C>T | rs372424994 |
| c.545T>C | rs200065059 |

### Related Disease
Mutations in NAIP have been associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and wasting. NAIP mutations are found in less than 1% of all SMA cases but are known to cause a milder form of the disease with later onset.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for SMA aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Supportive therapies include respiratory care, physical therapy, and orthopedic care to prevent scoliosis. Prognosis is variable and depends on several factors, including disease onset, severity of symptoms, and age at diagnosis.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response specific to NAIP mutations. However, recent advances in SMA treatment options, including gene therapy and antisense oligonucleotide therapy, have shown promising results in addressing the underlying cause of the disease.
