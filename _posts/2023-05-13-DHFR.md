# Gene DHFR

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 5
- Position: 35,286,665 - 35,295,710

## Pathology
DHFR gene mutations have been associated with susceptibility to various cancers, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

## Function
DHFR encodes an enzyme called dihydrofolate reductase which is involved in the folate metabolism pathway. This pathway is crucial for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation.
