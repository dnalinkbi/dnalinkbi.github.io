# Gene Information: UBR5

## Position

Gene UBR5 is located on chromosome 8 at position 8q12.1.

## Pathology

UBR5 gene is associated with developmental disorders, brain disorders, and cancer disease. UBR5 gene is found to be amplified and overexpressed in many types of cancer, which may contribute to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.

## Function

UBR5 gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is involved in protein degradation through the proteasome pathway. The protein encoded by UBR5 is involved in the regulation of numerous signaling pathways and cellular processes, such as DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation.

## Related Disease

UBR5 gene is associated with several diseases, such as:

- Neuropathy, hereditary sensory and autonomic, type IX (OMIM: 601928)
- Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain edema and/or leukoencephalopathy (OMIM: 617186)
- Mental retardation, autosomal recessive 48 (OMIM: 616593)
- Cancer, various types, including breast cancer, lung cancer, etc.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment or prognosis available for UBR5 gene-associated disorders. Diagnosis and management of symptoms are the main therapeutic measures available.

## Drug Response

Currently, there are no drugs available that specifically target UBR5 gene or its related pathways. However, studies have shown that inhibition of UBR5 can enhance the therapeutic response of cancer cells to other chemotherapeutic agents.
