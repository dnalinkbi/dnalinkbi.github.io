# Information about gene PIKFYVE

## Genetic Position

- Gene: PIKFYVE
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: q34

## Pathology

Mutations in the PIKFYVE gene can cause two rare inherited disorders - Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) and Fleck corneal dystrophy (FCD). 

- MLIV is a lysosomal storage disorder that affects the nervous system and causes developmental delay, vision and hearing loss, and muscle weakness. 
- FCD is a corneal dystrophy that affects the clarity of the cornea, leading to blindness in severe cases.

## Function

The PIKFYVE gene encodes the phosphoinositide kinase PIKFYVE, which is involved in several cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking and autophagy. It converts phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P₂) to modulate endosomal membrane trafficking and maturation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- c.2501C>T (p. Arg834Trp) rs121908001
- c.3538C>T (p. Arg1180Ter) rs137853905
- c.2867G>A (p. Arg956His) rs769460591
- c.394G>A (p. Arg132His) rs121908003

The listed mutations are all missense mutations, except for the second one which is a nonsense mutation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels in the PIKFYVE gene.

## Related Disease

- Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV)
- Fleck Corneal Dystrophy (FCD)

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no definitive cure for MLIV or FCD. Treatment is generally supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Prognosis varies based on the severity of the disease and the age at which symptoms appear.

## Drug Response

There are no known drugs that specifically target PIKFYVE mutations. However, some drugs such as diltiazem and loperamide have been found to help alleviate symptoms of MLIV in some cases.
