# Information about gene ANGPTL6

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

- Gene: ANGPTL6 (Angiopoietin-like 6)
- Location: Chromosome 19p13.3
- Pathology: ANGPTL6 has been associated with various diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Its dysregulation has been linked with glucose and lipid metabolism, angiogenesis, and inflammation.
- Function: ANGPTL6 is a secreted protein that belongs to the angiopoietin-like protein family. It plays a role in lipid metabolism by regulating the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL). ANGPTL6 also promotes tumor angiogenesis by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.

### External IDs and Aliases

- External IDs: HGNC: 19721, NCBI Entrez: 284158, Ensembl: ENSG00000105630, OMIM: 607091, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H168
- Aliases: ARP5, Betatrophin, C19orf80, TD26, and RIFL.
