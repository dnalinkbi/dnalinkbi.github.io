# Information about Gene ASPA

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- Gene Name: ASPA (Aspartoacylase)
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q21.31
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 760
    - NCBI Entrez: 443
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000108779
    - OMIM: 608034
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P45381
- Aliases: Canavanase, Acylaspartic Syndrome, Aspartoacylase Deficiency

### Function

The ASPA gene encodes the aspartoacylase enzyme, which is responsible for the breakdown of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA). NAA is primarily present in the brain and spinal cord and is believed to play a role in myelin production and maintenance. The breakdown of NAA by aspartoacylase helps to maintain the appropriate levels of this metabolite in the nervous system.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- c.79A>C (p.Lys27Gln) rs28939684
- c.472G>A (p.Gly158Ser) rs121908639
- c.698G>A (p.Arg233His) rs121908641
- c.865T>C (p.Leu289Ser) rs121908642

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic mutations for the ASPA gene.

### Related Disease

Mutations in the ASPA gene are associated with the autosomal recessive disorder Aspartoacylase Deficiency (also known as Canavan Disease). This disorder is characterized by the progressive destruction of white matter in the brain, leading to motor and cognitive deficits, seizures, developmental delay, and early death. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for Aspartoacylase Deficiency, and treatment is supportive. Drugs such as antiepileptics and muscle relaxants may be used to manage symptoms, while physical and occupational therapy can help patients maintain mobility and independence. Prognosis is poor, with most affected individuals dying in childhood or early adolescence.

### Drug Response

There is limited information available on the drug response of ASPA mutations.
