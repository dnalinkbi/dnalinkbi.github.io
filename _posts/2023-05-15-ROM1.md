# Gene: ROM1

### Function:
- Rod outer segment membrane protein 1
- Part of the photoreceptor complex in the retina of the eye
- Required for the normal structure and function of the photoreceptor cells

### External IDs:
- Gene: 6390
- Genomic location: Chromosome 11: 108,692,711-108,717,391
- Aliases: CTN32, POB1, RDS2, RETGC-1

- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P47804

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Arg39Trp: missense, rs61749879
- p.Ala89Val: missense, rs104894695

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
None reported

### Related Disease:
- Retinitis pigmentosa (RP): a group of genetic disorders that affect the retina, leading to progressive vision loss and eventual blindness.
- Macular degeneration: a condition that causes central vision loss due to damage in the macula, the region of the retina responsible for detailed vision.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Currently, there is no cure for RP or macular degeneration.
- Treatment options include medication, surgery, and assistive devices to help patients manage vision loss.

### Drug Response:
- No known drug response information is available for ROM1.
