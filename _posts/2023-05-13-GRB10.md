# Gene: GRB10

## Genetic Position:
GRB10 gene is located on chromosome 7, specifically on the q11.23 region.

## Pathology:
GRB10 has been implicated in several diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and cancer.

## Function:
GRB10, also known as growth factor receptor-bound protein 10, plays a vital role in insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism.
