# Information on Gene PROS1

## Genetic Position
The PROS1 gene is located on chromosome 3 at position 3q11.2.

## Pathology and Function
The PROS1 gene produces a protein called Protein S, which acts as a natural anticoagulant in the blood. Mutations in this gene can lead to deficiencies in Protein S levels, which can increase the risk of blood clotting and related disorders such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Here are some examples of amino acid mutations and their associated mutation type and dbSNP ID in the PROS1 gene:

| Amino Acid Mutation  | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Cys97Gly            | Missense      | rs121964965 |
| Ser284Arg           | Missense      | rs121964964 |
| Arg581Ter           | Nonsense      | rs137852673 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the PROS1 gene.

## Related Disease
Deficiencies in Protein S levels due to mutations in the PROS1 gene are associated with increased risk of blood clotting disorders such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for deficiencies in Protein S levels due to PROS1 mutations typically involves anticoagulant therapy, which can help prevent blood clots from forming. The prognosis for individuals with PROS1 mutations varies depending on the severity of the deficiency and the presence of other risk factors.

## Drug Response
Certain anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin and heparin may be less effective in individuals with deficiencies in Protein S levels due to PROS1 mutations. Alternative anticoagulant therapies may need to be considered.
