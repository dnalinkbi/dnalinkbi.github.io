# Gene Information

## Gene CYP1A2

- Function: This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. The CYP1A2 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and its expression is induced by some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are found in cigarette smoke.

- Related disease:
  * CYP1A2-related disorders: According to OMIM, essentially drug metabolism status and interindividual differences are associated with the CYP1A2 gene. Variation of the CYP1A2 gene can affect the plasma levels of caffeine, which can cause increased risk of myocardial infarction if consumed in high doses.

- Treatment and prognosis:
  * CYP1A2-related disorders: The CYP1A2 gene may affect how individuals metabolize specific drugs. Individuals with reduced activity may be at higher risk of adverse effects from certain drugs, such as clozapine and theophylline.

- Drug Response: 
  * CYP1A2 has been associated with drug response to various medications, including clozapine, theophylline, and caffeine.
