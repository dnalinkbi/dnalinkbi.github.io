## Gene: GYS2

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- Chromosome location: 12q24.31
- Pathology: Glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD0) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GYS2 gene.

### Function
- The GYS2 gene encodes glycogen synthase 2, which is responsible for converting glucose into glycogen for energy storage in the liver and muscles.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 4643
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 2998
- Ensembl: ENSG00000186868
- OMIM: 138570
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P54840
- Aliases: GYS2, GYG2

### AA Mutation list and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Tyr548Cys: missense variant with dbSNP ID rs150215553
- p.Ser642Asn: missense variant with dbSNP ID rs141126955
- p.Ala785Val: missense variant with dbSNP ID rs121908019
- p.Leu930Pro: missense variant with dbSNP ID rs200236394

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- None reported in dbSNP

### Related Diseases
- Glycogen storage disease type 0

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment involves maintaining normal glucose levels and avoiding fasting or prolonged periods of exercise.
- The long-term outcome for individuals with GSD0 treated with dietary intervention is generally good.

### Drug Response
- Not applicable as there are currently no drugs approved specifically for GSD0.
