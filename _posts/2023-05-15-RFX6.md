# Information about Gene RFX6 

## Genetic Position
The RFX6 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q22.31).

## Pathology
RFX6 is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies have shown that mutations or polymorphisms in the RFX6 gene can lead to decreased insulin secretion and impaired glucose metabolism, ultimately resulting in the development of T2DM.

## Function
The RFX6 gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that plays a crucial role in pancreatic islet development and insulin secretion. It regulates the expression of several genes involved in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, insulin secretion, and glucose metabolism.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several variants in the RFX6 gene have been associated with T2DM. Below are some examples of amino acid mutations with their corresponding dbSNP ID and mutation type:

|Mutation |dbSNP ID |Mutation Type |
|---------|---------|--------------|
|Arg415Gln |rs61748128 |Missense      |
|Leu111Ile |rs3814571  |Missense      |

|Pro33Leu |rs150880563|Missense      |
|Arg189*  |rs150569364|Nonsense      |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported for RFX6 in the COSMIC database.

## Related Disease
RFX6 mutations are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for RFX6 mutations. However, early diagnosis through genetic testing can help manage T2DM symptoms and prevent complications. The prognosis for individuals with RFX6 mutations depends on the severity of their diabetes and other associated risk factors.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response specific to RFX6 mutations.
