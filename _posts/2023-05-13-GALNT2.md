# Gene GALNT2

## Information
- **Function:** GALNT2 (polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine/threonine residues on proteins to initiate O-glycosylation.
- **External IDs:**
    - Gene ID: 2589
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 1q41
    - Aliases: ppGaNTase-T2
