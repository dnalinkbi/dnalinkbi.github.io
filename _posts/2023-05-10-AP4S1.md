## Gene: AP4S1

- Function: The AP4S1 gene encodes for a subunit of the adapter protein complex 4 (AP4), which is involved in vesicular trafficking in the cell.

- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 608
    - NCBI Entrez: 11140
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000138126
    - OMIM: 607245
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6A6

- Genomic location: Chromosome 14q12

- Aliases: Adaptor-Related Protein Complex 4 Sigma 1 Subunit, Sigma 4A, Sigma-4A, Sigma4A

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - c.344T>G (p.Val115Gly); rs397514542
    - c.423T>A (p.Leu141His); rs794728668
    - c.526T>C (p.Leu176Pro); rs794728669
    - c.258delG (p.Gly86Alafs*2); rs786205032

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: None reported.

- Related disease: Mutations in AP4S1 have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs.

- Treatment and prognosis: There is no cure for HSP, but physical therapy and assistive devices can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

- Drug response: No specific drug response has been identified for AP4S1 mutations in HSP.
