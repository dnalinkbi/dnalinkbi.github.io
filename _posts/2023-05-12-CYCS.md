# Gene: CYCS

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 7, 31,909,330-31,911,655
- **Pathology:** CYCS is associated with various diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiac diseases. Mutations in this gene can result in cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, which impairs the oxidative phosphorylation system and leads to a variety of disorders.
- **Function:** CYCS is a small heme-containing protein that plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain of aerobic respiration. It is responsible for transferring electrons between Complex III and Complex IV and facilitating the production of ATP. CYCS also has a role in apoptosis, where it is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, initiating the caspase cascade.

- **Related Disease:** Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Leukemia, Congenital sideroblastic anemia, Alzheimer's disease.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure available for CYCS related disorders. Treatment is usually symptomatic, and supportive care is provided to manage the symptoms. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder.
- **Drug response:** Several compounds have been found to target CYCS in the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. These include curcumin, cardamonin, and protopanaxadiol.
