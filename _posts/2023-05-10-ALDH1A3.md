# Genetic Information Analysis: Gene ALDH1A3

## Gene Information
The ALDH1A3 gene is located on chromosome 15q26.3 and its genomic position spans from 98,783,734 to 98,824,339. The gene is also known by the following aliases: ALDC, PUM2, RETSDR4, RALDH3.

## Function of ALDH1A3 Gene
The ALDH1A3 gene encodes the aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A3 enzyme which plays an important role in the detoxification of aldehydes generated by alcohol metabolism and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the enzyme plays a role in the metabolism of retinoic acid and synthesis of other signaling molecules.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the ALDH1A3 gene have been associated with a variety of diseases including autosomal dominant ovarian dysgenesis, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depends on the specific disease associated with mutations in the ALDH1A3 gene. For example, patients with ovarian dysgenesis may require hormone replacement therapy, while patients with cancer may require surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy.

## Drug Response
Research suggests that ALDH1A3 may play a role in drug resistance in a variety of cancers. Targeting the enzyme may sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.
