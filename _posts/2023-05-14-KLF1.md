## Gene KLF1

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 19q13.33

**Pathology:** KLF1 is associated with various blood-related diseases, particularly with the regulation of erythrocyte differentiation and hemoglobin production.

**Function for gene:** The KLF1 gene encodes for a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a critical role in controlling erythropoiesis, specifically in the regulation of globin and heme metabolism.
