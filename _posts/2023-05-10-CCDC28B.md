# Information about Gene CCDC28B

## Genetic Position
CCDC28B gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q26.31.

## Pathology and Function
CCDC28B gene encodes a protein called Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 28B. The protein has a role in the regulation of cilia, which plays a crucial role in normal respiratory function. Mutations in CCDC28B gene have been linked with various lung diseases, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the symptoms and complications of these diseases can be managed through various treatments, such as antibiotics, bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy.

## Drug Response
No specific drugs have been developed to target CCDC28B gene. However, drugs used to treat the symptoms of PCD and COPD may have varying levels of efficacy depending on the individual.
