## Gene GNE

### Genetic Position
The GNE gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q31.2-q31.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the GNE gene have been associated with several diseases, including a form of hereditary inclusion body myopathy known as Nonaka myopathy; sialuria, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of sialic acid in the urine; and autosomal-recessive sialidosis, which affects both the nervous system and other organs.

### Function
The GNE gene encodes the bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, which is involved in the first two steps of sialic acid biosynthesis.

### Related Disease
Mutations in GNE have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Nonaka myopathy
- Sialuria
- Autosomal-recessive sialidosis

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for the diseases associated with GNE mutations, and treatment options are typically focused on symptom management and supportive care.

### Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs specifically approved to treat GNE-related diseases. However, researchers are investigating potential treatments, including enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy.
