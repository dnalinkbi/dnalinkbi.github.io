## Gene: OGT

### Genetic Position
The OGT gene is located on chromosome Xq13.1

### Pathology
OGT has been associated with various diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders.

### Function
The OGT gene encodes for O-GlcNAc transferase, an enzyme responsible for adding O-GlcNAc sugar molecules to intracellular proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification crucial for various physiological processes, including transcriptional regulation, protein degradation, and cellular signaling.
