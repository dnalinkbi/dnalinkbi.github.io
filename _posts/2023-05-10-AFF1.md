## Gene Information Analysis for AFF1

### Gene Name and ID Information
- Gene name: AF4/FMR2 family member 1 (AFF1)
- Gene ID: HGNC:312, Entrez Gene ID: 27125, Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000125166 

### Gene Function 
- AFF1 gene encodes for the af4/fmr2 family member 1 protein which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation through chromatin binding and regulation of RNA polymerase II activity. It also takes part in the formation of nuclear speckles and contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing. 

### Genomic Location 
- Chromosome: 4 
- Location (base pair): 155,207,417 - 155,323,100

### Aliases 
- MLLT2, or CDK9 associated C-type cyclin-like 1 (CCNT1)
