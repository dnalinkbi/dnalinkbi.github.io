# Information about Gene SLC6A3

## Genetic Position
SLC6A3 is a gene located on chromosome 5 at the position 5p15.33.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SLC6A3 gene have been associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

## Function
SLC6A3 encodes a protein called dopamine transporter (DAT), which plays a crucial role in regulating dopamine levels in the brain by transporting dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into presynaptic neurons.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000151632
- OMIM: 126455
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q01959
- Aliases: DAT1, DAT

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- 372Ala/Thr, missense_variant, rs1800497
- 559Thr/Ile, missense_variant, rs406065

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the SLC6A3 gene.

## Related Disease
- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Bipolar disorder
- Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
- Parkinson's Disease

## Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options for SLC6A3-related disorders largely involve medications that target dopamine levels in the brain, including stimulants for ADHD and dopaminergic drugs for Parkinson's Disease. The prognosis for patients with SLC6A3-related disorders varies depending on the condition and severity of the symptoms.

## Drug response
Individuals with certain SLC6A3 gene variants may respond differently to medications affecting dopamine levels in the brain, leading to differences in drug efficacy and side effects.
