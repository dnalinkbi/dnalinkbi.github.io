# Gene: ERCC8

### Genomic Location and External IDs

- Chromosome: 5
- Genomic location: NC_000005.10:g.131,067,176-131,123,423
- Gene ID: 1161
- HGNC ID: 3428
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000113441
- OMIM ID: 609413
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q13216
- Aliases: CSA, COFS3

### Function

The ERCC8 gene encodes for a protein called CSA (Cockayne syndrome complementation group A), which plays a vital role in DNA repair. Specifically, it is involved in a process called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), where it recognizes and removes damaged DNA during transcription.

### AA Mutation and SNP list

There are multiple AA mutations associated with the ERCC8 gene. Some of them are:

- p.Ser89Leu (rs137853332)
- p.Arg153Cys (rs121434568)
- p.Asp251Asn (rs137853331)
- p.Asp316Gly (rs137853330)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

Some somatic SNVs/InDels are:

- rs757596316
- rs756127797
- rs772960506

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the ERCC8 gene have been linked to several diseases, including:

- Cockayne syndrome
- UV-sensitive syndrome
- Xeroderma pigmentosum

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for Cockayne syndrome or UV-sensitive syndrome, and treatment is mainly supportive and focuses on managing the symptoms. Xeroderma pigmentosum can be managed by avoiding UV exposure and regular skin checks.

### Drug Response

There is currently no approved drug to treat Cockayne syndrome, UV sensitivity syndrome, or Xeroderma pigmentosum. However, several drugs are being investigated for their potential to improve DNA repair, including PARP inhibitors and other chemotherapeutic agents.
