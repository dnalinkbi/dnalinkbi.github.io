# Analysis of Gene TCAP

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** TCAP (Titin-Cap)
- **Aliases:** Telethonin, T-Cap, LIM domain binding protein 3 (LDB3)
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 10q23.2
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC ID: 6490
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 28988
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000107613
    - OMIM ID: 605906
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NQ17

## Function for Gene
The TCAP gene encodes a protein called telethonin or T-cap which is mainly found in cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers. It plays a significant role in the assembly and maintenance of Z-discs in the sarcomeres. Telethonin is known to interact with many proteins, for instance, it binds to actin, troponin T, and titin, which are involved in muscle contraction and relaxation.

## Mutations and Related Diseases
- The TCAP gene is associated with several cardiovascular diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
- Mutations in TCAP have been reported to cause autosomal dominant DCM, characterized by an enlarged heart and weakened heart muscle resulting in heart failure.
- Somatic mutations in TCAP have also been observed in cancer, including colorectal cancer and breast cancer.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Below is a summary of some of the amino acid mutations in the TCAP gene, along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID where available:

|AA Change|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|L5F|Missense|rs104894509|
|T20I|Missense|rs759990944|
|G22R|Missense|rs104894510|
|R25W|Missense|rs797044386|
|L27P|Missense|rs797044387|
|E102K|Missense|rs199825970|
|N122S|Missense|rs797044391|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
The TCAP gene has several somatic mutations that have been reported in different types of cancer. Some of these mutations include:

|AA Change|Mutation type|dbSNP ID|Cancer type|
|---|---|---|---|
|I92M|Missense|rs563957222|Breast carcinoma|
|G103D|Missense|rs544383015|Colorectal adenocarcinoma|
|S118F|Missense|rs886040605|Colorectal adenocarcinoma|

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment for TCAP-related diseases mainly includes medications to manage the symptoms and prevent further complications. In severe cases, heart transplant may be required.
- The prognosis for TCAP-associated DCM varies depending on the severity of the condition. Some patients may experience rapid deterioration in cardiac function while others may remain stable for a long time.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug therapy for TCAP-related diseases. However, medications like beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and diuretics are used to manage the symptoms of heart failure.
