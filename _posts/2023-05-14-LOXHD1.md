## Gene Information for LOXHD1

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 18: 49,613,334-49,696,283
- **Function for Gene:** The LOXHD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. The protein is responsible for the proper formation and function of stereocilia, tiny hair-like projections that detect sound.
- **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 169482
    - HGNC ID: 28364
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000184252
    - OMIM ID: 613072
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q6N021
    - Alias: DFNB77
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Ala1948Thr (rs34215704)
    - p.Arg2465Gln (rs150818684)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported
- **Related Disease:** LOXHD1 mutations have been associated with a form of inherited hearing loss, autosomal recessive hearing impairment type 77 (DFNB77).
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for DFNB77 or any other form of genetic hearing loss. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms and helping patients cope with their hearing loss. Cochlear implants and hearing aids are often effective in improving communication abilities.
- **Drug Response:** None reported
