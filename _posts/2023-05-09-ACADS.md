## Gene ACADS information

### *Genetic Position*
The ACADS gene, also known as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short-chain, is located on chromosome 12 at the position 12q24.31.

### *Pathology*
Mutations in the ACADS gene can cause a shortage of the enzyme it codes for, which can lead to a metabolic disorder called short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD). SCADD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to convert certain fats into energy. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 

### *Function for gene*
The ACADS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD). This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a group of fats called short-chain fatty acids.

### *External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases*
- Gene ID: 36
- HGNC ID: 113
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000151388
- OMIM ID: 606885
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P16219
- Genomic Location: Chr12:110,493,982-110,509,280
- Alias(es): ACAD2, SCAD

### *AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID*
The ACADS gene has multiple mutations that can cause SCADD. Some of the commonly reported ones are listed below.

| Amino Acid Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Gly185Ser | Missense | rs121908601 |
| p.Thr201Met | Missense | rs28941777 |
| p.Ser52Lys | Missense | rs72879239 |
| p.Ala123Val | Missense | rs121908600 |

### *Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID*
There are somatic mutations reported in the ACADS gene, but they are not known to be related to any disease.

### *Related disease*
Mutations in the ACADS gene can cause the metabolic disorder short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD). SCADD is typically diagnosed in infants or young children. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including developmental delays, low muscle tone, and seizures. However, many individuals with SCADD do not have any symptoms and are identified through newborn screening programs.

### *Treatment and prognosis*
There is currently no cure for SCADD, but the condition can be managed through dietary changes and careful monitoring. Individuals with SCADD should avoid fasting and eat frequent meals that are rich in carbohydrates to maintain a steady blood sugar level.

### *Drug response*
There is no known drug that directly targets SCADD. However, individuals with SCADD should avoid certain medications and supplements that can worsen their condition, including valproic acid and medium-chain triglycerides.
