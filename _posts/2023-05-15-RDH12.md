## Gene RDH12

- **Function:** The RDH12 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called retinol dehydrogenase 12, which is involved in the visual cycle. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of retinol to retinaldehyde, a crucial step in the process of vision.

- **External IDs:**
  - Gene ID: 145226
  - Genomic location: Chromosome 14:62,453,333-62,484,637
  - Aliases: RETHD12, RRD, RDH13

- **External sites:**
  - HGNC: 20141
  - NCBI Entrez: 145226
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000129534
  - OMIM: 608830
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96KN2

- **AA mutation list:**
  - p.Leu186Arg

  - p.Arg161His
  - p.Leu134LeufsTer7
  - p.Gln141Ter
  - p.Arg161Cys
  - p.Arg161Ser

- **Mutation type and dbSNP ID:**
  - Missense: rs61751071
  - Frameshift: rs121918386
  - Nonsense: rs121918385

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  - N/A

- **Related disease:** Mutations in the RDH12 gene are associated with a rare form of inherited retinal disease called Leber congenital amaurosis 13 (LCA13). This disease is characterized by severe vision loss from birth or early childhood, nystagmus, and absent or severely reduced electrical signals in the retina.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for LCA13. Treatment options include gene therapy, which involves the use of genetically modified viruses to deliver functional copies of the RDH12 gene to the retina. The prognosis for individuals with LCA13 is generally poor, and most affected individuals experience progressive vision loss over time.

- **Drug response:** There is currently no drug therapy specifically designed for LCA13.
