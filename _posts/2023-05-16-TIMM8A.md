# Gene Information Analysis: TIMM8A

## Genetic Position and Pathology

* **Gene Name:** TIMM8A (Translocase of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane 8A)
* **Chromosome Number:** X
* **Genomic Location:** Xq22.1
* **Pathology:** TIMM8A gene mutations are associated with deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy (DDON) syndrome, which is a rare X-linked disorder that typically affects males. The mutation causes a defect in protein import into the mitochondria and leads to neurodegeneration of the optic and auditory nerves.

## Function

The TIMM8A gene encodes a protein that is an essential component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. It plays a critical role in the trafficking of nuclear-encoded proteins to the mitochondria, where they are required for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.

## External IDs and Aliases

* **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000198711
* **OMIM ID:** 304700
* **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** O60220
* **Aliases:** DDP, DDONA, DDONX, TIM8, TIMM8

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for the TIMM8A gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in TIMM8A are associated with deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy (DDON) syndrome, which is a rare X-linked disease that typically affects males. The disease is characterized by deafness, dystonia, and optic atrophy, which can result in visual impairment.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for DDON syndrome. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms of the disease, such as hearing and vision impairment, and dystonia. The prognosis for individuals with DDON syndrome is poor, as the disease is progressive and can lead to severe disability.

## Drug Response

There is no specific drug that is targeted at treating DDON syndrome, as it is caused by a genetic mutation. However, there are medications that can be used to manage the symptoms of the disease, such as hearing aids or cochlear implants for hearing loss, and medications for dystonia.
