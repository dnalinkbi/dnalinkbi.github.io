## Information about gene PRICKLE1

### Gene and Genomic Position
- Gene: PRICKLE1
- Genomic Location: Chr1: 166,242,347-166,475,748
- Aliases: Pk1, Espinas, hu, rc2h, rjs, stump, van, MGC21430

### Function
- The PRICKLE1 gene encodes a member of the prickle family, which is involved in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity.
- It helps regulate cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with the Wnt/PCP pathway, actin, and microtubules.
- PRICKLE1 is also involved in neural development and synaptic function.
