# Gene: CYP2A6

## Information
CYP2A6 gene is located on the chromosome 19 at the position q13.2. It encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of a variety of drugs and endogenous compounds. The CYP2A6 enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver, where it functions in the oxidation of nicotine, coumarin, and other xenobiotics.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the CYP2A6 gene have been linked to various diseases, such as:
- Lung cancer 
- Bladder cancer 
- Head and neck cancer 
- Polymorphic drug metabolism 
- Nicotine addiction

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments or prognoses associated with mutations in the CYP2A6 gene. However, understanding the genetic background of CYP2A6 does provide insight into nicotine dependence and individual response to various drugs.

## Drug Response
Studies have found that individuals with specific mutations in the CYP2A6 gene may have altered responses to drugs metabolized by the CYP2A6 pathway, including nicotine, cotinine, and several other psychotropic compounds.
