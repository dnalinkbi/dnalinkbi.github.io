## Information about gene LMO2

### Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic position**: LMO2 (LIM domain only 2) is located on human chromosome 11p13. It's a protein-coding gene with a length of 15.9 kb.
- **Pathology**: LMO2 is a proto-oncogene that plays a role in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). LMO2 is involved in chromosomal translocations in which its regulatory sequences are juxtaposed to T-cell receptor (TCR) genes and drive their overexpression. 
- **Function**: LMO2 encodes a transcriptional regulator that contains two LIM domains. It forms a complex with other transcription factors, such as GATA3 and TAL1, to control the expression of genes involved in T cell differentiation and hematopoietic development.

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
    - rs372452602 (T-ALL)
    - rs776567362 (T-ALL)

### Related diseases

- LMO2 is associated with the following diseases:
    - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
    - B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
    - Angiocentric T-cell lymphoma

### Treatment and prognosis

- LMO2 overexpression is a poor prognostic factor for T-ALL. Patients with LMO2-positive T-ALL have a worse outcome than those with LMO2-negative disease.
- The treatment of LMO2-positive T-ALL typically involves intensive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

### Drug response

- LMO2 is a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL. Several small-molecule inhibitors of LMO2 are being developed for the treatment of this disease.
