# Gene information for CAMK4

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- CAMK4 is located on chromosome 5, specifically at position 5q35.1.
- Pathology related to this gene includes various mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism.

## Gene Function

- The CAMK4 gene encodes for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV, which is a member of the CaMK family of serine/threonine kinases.
- It is involved in various cellular and molecular functions such as synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.
- It also has a role in gene transcription and regulation, as well as cell growth and differentiation.

## External IDs and Aliases

- HGNC ID: 1495
- NCBI Entrez ID: 815
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000134057
- OMIM ID: 114078
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q16566
- Aliases: KIAA0843, CaMKIV

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- There are several amino acid mutations associated with CAMK4, including:
  - R309Q (rs2239219)
  - T287S (rs2239224)
  - V866A (rs2229587)
  - V867A (rs2229588)
- These mutations are missense mutations, which means they alter a single amino acid in the protein sequence.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are several somatic mutations in CAMK4, including:
  - rs371904477
  - rs371398190
