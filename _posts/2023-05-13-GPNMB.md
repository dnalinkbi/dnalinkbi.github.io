# Gene GPNMB

## Genetic position

The gene GPNMB (Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B) is located on chromosome 7q21.2.

## Pathology

GPNMB has been associated with multiple diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and glaucoma. In particular, GPNMB has been found to be overexpressed in several types of cancer, such as breast, melanoma, and glioblastoma, and is associated with tumor progression and metastasis.

## Function

GPNMB is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It has also been shown to play a role in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.
