# Gene Information for LAMB2

## General Information
- **Gene Name:** LAMB2 (Laminin Subunit Beta 2)
- **Aliases:** LAMB2A
- **Function:** LAMB2 encodes for a protein called laminin-332, which is a component of the extracellular matrix that plays a role in cellular adhesion and differentiation. Specifically, laminin-332 is involved in the formation of epithelial tissues.

## Genomic Location and IDs
- **Genomic Position:** Chromosome 3: 159,163,050-159,239,468 
- **External IDs:** 
    * HGNC: 6479
    * NCBI Entrez: 3913
    * Ensembl: ENSG00000164062
    * OMIM: 150325
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P55268

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** 
    * p.Cys321Tyr
    * p.Arg2157*
- **Mutation Type:** Missense, Nonsense
- **dbSNP IDs:** rs28940884, rs137853123

## Somatic Mutations
- No somatic mutations have been reported for LAMB2 in the COSMIC database.

## Related Diseases
- **Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Type 1C (MDC1C):** Inherited disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting that begins in early childhood. Mutations in LAMB2 have been identified as a cause of MDC1C.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis of MDC1C varies depending on the severity and extent of the symptoms. Physical therapy, orthotics, and surgery may be required in some cases.

## Drug Response
- There is no information available about drug response specific to mutations in LAMB2.
