# Genetic Information for Gene ROS1

## Gene Information

- Function: The ROS1 gene encodes for the ROS proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase, which plays a role in cellular growth and differentiation. It is also involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.
- External IDs:
    - Gene ID: 6098
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 6q22.1
    - Aliases: ROS, MCF3, c-ros-1, proto-oncogene ROS

## Mutations

- AA mutation list and mutation type:

| Mutation           | Type          | dbSNP ID      |

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are numerous somatic SNVs/InDels in the ROS1 gene, but without additional context, a comprehensive list is not possible to provide.

## Related Disease

Recent studies have shown that ROS1 gene fusions are present in a variety of cancers, including lung, gastric, colorectal, ovarian, and cholangiocarcinoma. These fusions lead to the constitutive activation of the ROS1 kinase domain, driving cellular proliferation and metastasis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to target ROS1 fusions, including crizotinib, entrectinib, and lorlatinib. Treatment with these TKIs has shown promising results, with tumor regression and improved progression-free survival in ROS1-positive patients. However, resistance to TKIs can develop over time, and alternative therapeutic strategies are being explored.

## Drug Response

ROS1-positive patients have shown a positive response to TKIs, including crizotinib, entrectinib, and lorlatinib.
