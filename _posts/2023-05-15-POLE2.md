## Gene: POLE2

### Genetic Position
POLE2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q21) in humans.

### Pathology
Mutations in POLE2 have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer. It has also been found to play a role in the development of other cancers such as glioblastoma and breast cancer.

### Function
POLE2 encodes for a subunit of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex. The protein is involved in DNA replication and repair processes.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for cancers with POLE2 mutations may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Prognosis may vary depending on the stage and type of cancer.

### Drug Response
Currently, there are no specific drugs targeting POLE2 mutations. However, ongoing research is focused on developing targeted therapies for DNA replication and repair pathways.
