## Gene Name: GPR143

### Function
GPR143 is involved in the signaling pathway that regulates the expression and transport of melanin-containing pigment granules in melanocytes. It is believed to play a role in the pigmentation of the eyes, skin, and hair.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic SNVs or InDels were found for GPR143 in the COSMIC database.

### Related Disease
Mutations in GPR143 are associated with ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), a genetic condition characterized by vision abnormalities and hypopigmentation of the retina, iris, and skin.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for ocular albinism type 1, and treatment is mostly supportive. Visual aids and low-vision rehabilitation may be useful for individuals with impaired vision.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information on drug response specific to mutations in GPR143.
