# Information on Gene CRADD

## Genetic Position

CRADD gene is located on chromosome 2 in humans, at position 2p25.1.

## Pathology

CRADD gene has been linked with various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and bladder cancer. Mutations in CRADD have also been associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

## Function

CRADD (CASP2 and RIPK1 domain-containing adaptor protein) gene encodes a protein that is required for the activation of caspase-2, an enzyme involved in the initiation of apoptosis (programmed cell death). CRADD protein functions as an adaptor molecule that bridges between caspase-2 and the upstream receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), facilitating the activation of caspase-2.

## AA Mutation List, Mutation Type, and dbSNP ID

No AA mutations in CRADD gene have been reported in human population.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels and dbSNP ID

No reported somatic SNVs/InDels in CRADD gene have been reported so far.

## Related Disease

- Gastric cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Inflammatory bowel disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for patients with CRADD mutations. However, several chemotherapeutic agents like 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan are being used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The prognosis of CRADD-related cancer is still not very clear and requires further investigation.

## Drug Response

No information is currently available on drug response with respect to CRADD gene mutation.
