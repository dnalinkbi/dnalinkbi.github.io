# Information about gene APOBEC1

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- Gene: APOBEC1 (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Enzyme Catalytic Subunit 1)
- Chromosome location: 12q24.1
- Pathology: APOBEC1 has been associated with several cancers, including lung, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It has also been linked to regulation of lipoprotein metabolism.

## Function
- Function: APOBEC1 is an RNA-editing enzyme that converts a cytosine to a uracil in the apolipoprotein B (APOB) mRNA, which results in the editing of the APOB protein sequence.
- Aliases: A1CF, ACF, APOBEC-1 complementation factor

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for APOBEC1-related diseases, but current treatments focus on managing symptoms and reducing risk factors.
- Prognosis depends on the specific disease and its stage at diagnosis.

## Drug Response
- APOBEC1-targeting drugs have not yet been developed.
