# Information about gene GIGYF2

## Gene Position
- GIGYF2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2. (2q37.1)

## Pathology and Function
- GIGYF2 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a role in regulating cell growth and the cell cycle.
- Mutations in the GIGYF2 gene have been associated with the development of several types of cancer, including breast and prostate cancer.
- Studies have also suggested that GIGYF2 may play a role in the development of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease.
