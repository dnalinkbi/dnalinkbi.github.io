# Information about gene LAMA3

## Genetic Position
LAMA3 gene is located on the q29 region of chromosome 18 (18q11.2-q12.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in LAMA3 gene result in a rare genetic disorder called Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB). This disorder affects the skin and mucous membranes causing blistering, erosions, and scarring. 

## Function
LAMA3 encodes the protein laminin-332, which is involved in the formation and maintenance of basement membranes in various tissues, including skin.

## Related Disease
- Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for JEB. Treatment mainly involves managing symptoms (such as wound care) and preventing infections. The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the disease. 

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug for JEB. However, several treatments (such as gene therapy and protein replacement therapy) are being investigated to improve symptoms and possibly cure the disease.
