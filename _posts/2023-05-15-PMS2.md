# Information about Gene PMS2

## Gene Position
The PMS2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 22.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PMS2 gene have been linked to Lynch syndrome, which is an inherited condition that increases the risk of colon, endometrial, ovarian, and other types of cancer.

## Function
The PMS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in DNA repair. This protein helps to fix mistakes that occur when DNA is copied in preparation for cell division.

## Related Disease
Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with Lynch syndrome require close medical monitoring and may need to undergo preventative surgeries. The prognosis varies depending on the extent and type of cancer.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs specifically designed to target PMS2 gene mutations in Lynch syndrome.
