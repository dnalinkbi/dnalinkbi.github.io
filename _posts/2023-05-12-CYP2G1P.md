## Gene Information: CYP2G1P

### Position and Pathology
- CYP2G1P is located on Chromosome 7 (7q21.11)
- It is a pseudogene, meaning it is an inactive gene that is no longer functional
- Hence, it is not associated with any pathology.

### Function 
- The function of CYP2G1P is unknown, although it is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.

### External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic location
- HGNC: 25307
- NCBI Entrez: NA
- Ensembl: ENSG00000276441
- OMIM: NA
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: NA
- Aliases include: CYP2G1, CYP2G2

### AA Mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- Since CYP2G1P is a pseudogene, there are no mutations associated with it.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 
- There are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with CYP2G1P.

### Related Disease
- There are no diseases associated with CYP2G1P.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- As there are no diseases associated with CYP2G1P, there is no treatment or prognosis information available.

### Drug response
- Since the function of CYP2G1P is unknown, there is no drug response information available.

### Related Papers
- NA

**Instructions:**
- To provide the information about a gene such as its position, pathology, function, external IDs, aliases, mutation list and type, related disease, treatment, drug response, and related papers, first introduce the gene with its name in bold. 
- Then, provide the position, pathology, and function information in bullet points using markdown syntax. 
- Next, add the external IDs, aliases, and genomic location of the gene. 
- After that, list the AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID. If the gene is a pseudogene, mention that there are no mutations. 
- Similarly, if there are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the gene, mention that. 
- If there are any diseases related to the gene, list them under the "Related Disease" section. 
- If there is any information related to treatment, prognosis or drug response, mention that in the respective sections. 
- Finally, add the related author name, DOI links to related papers at the end of the answer.
