# Gene ATP1B1

## Genetic Position

- The gene ATP1B1 is located on the chromosomal position 1q21.1.

## Pathology

- The mutations in the ATP1B1 gene have been associated with various diseases. These include:
  - Hypertension
  - Diabetes
  - Renal tubular acidosis

## Function

- The ATP1B1 gene encodes for a subunit of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, which is responsible for the active transport of sodium and potassium ions across cell membranes.
- This gene is involved in maintaining the electrochemical gradients and regulating cellular volume.
