# Gene: MB21D2

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 9
- Location: q31.1

## Pathology
- MB21D2 is a protein-coding gene that is a member of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) family, which plays a key role in the host immune response to DNA viruses and intracellular bacteria.
- Mutations in the MB21D2 gene have been linked to certain autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.

## Function
- MB21D2 encodes a protein that catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP.
- cGAMP functions as a signaling molecule that activates the innate immune response by triggering the production of interferons and other cytokines.
