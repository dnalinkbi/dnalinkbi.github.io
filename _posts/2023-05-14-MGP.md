# Gene MGP

## Information
- Function: MGP (Matrix Gla Protein) is a vitamin K-dependent, non-collagenous protein. It is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix calcification and bone mineralization.
- External IDs: HGNC:7112, Entrez Gene: 4256, Ensembl: ENSG00000136038, OMIM: 154870
- Genomic location: Chromosome 12q12-q14.3
- Aliases: Gla protein, matrix, ECM2

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: The mutations in MGP that have been reported are P10L, E19K, P20R, D27G, D27H, D27V, W32X, T36M, Q40X, I63T, E68K, L73P, R74W, R74Q, R75C, G83S, S84L, K93R, S101R, E105K, T112R, S116F, V118F, E130V, D136Y, W139L, V140I, S143F, N145S, S155G, and R162W
- Mutation type: Missense, nonsense, frameshift
- dbSNP IDs: rs121908663, rs121908664, rs121908665, rs121908666, rs121908667, rs121908668, rs121908669, rs57945921

## Related Diseases
- Keutel syndrome
- Arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73
- Autosomal dominant idiopathic arterial calcification
- Generalized arterial calcification of infancy
- MED, type IV

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for MGP-related diseases focuses on the management of symptoms. Since there is no cure for these diseases, regular monitoring is required to detect and treat complications early. Prognosis is variable and depends on the severity and extent of calcification.

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug for the treatment of MGP-related diseases. However, some drugs, such as bisphosphonates and warfarin, may slow down the progression of the disease.
