# Information about gene CDH23

## Genetic Position
CDH23 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22.1)

## Pathology
Mutations in CDH23 gene have been associated with various hearing disorders including autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural deafness type DFNB12, Usher syndrome type 1D and age-related hearing loss.

## Function
CDH23 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cadherin-23. This protein is found on the stereocilia tips of hair cells in the inner ear and plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of these cells.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: HGNC:1746
- NCBI Entrez ID: 64072
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000117984
- OMIM ID: 605516
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9H251
- Other Aliases: USH1D, DFNB12, CDHR23, PCDH23

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Variations in CDH23 can cause different types of amino acid substitutions. Some of the known mutations and their types are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Trp56* | Nonsense | rs1060491637 |
| p.Thr309Ala | Missense | rs74315406 |
| p.Gly1678Ala | Missense | rs724159054 |
| p.Gly4123Ser | Missense | rs375931105 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in CDH23 gene are less commonly reported but some of the known variations and their dbSNP IDs are:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.11600C>T | Missense | rs757024881 |
| c.14077C>G | Missense | rs786204343 |
| c.12827dup | InDel | rs775693939 |

## Related Disease
Variations in CDH23 gene are associated with several hearing disorders including:

- Autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural deafness type DFNB12
- Usher syndrome type 1D
- Age-related hearing loss

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for hearing loss caused by CDH23 mutations. However, hearing aids and cochlear implants may provide some benefit. The prognosis for individuals with CDH23-related hearing loss varies depending on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is no specific drug treatment available for CDH23-related hearing loss.
