## Information about Gene CLEC7A

### Genetic Position
- Gene: CLEC7A (C-type lectin domain family 7 member A)
- Chromosome: 12
- Location: p13.2
- Strand: Plus
- Genome Assembly: GRCh38.p13
- Locus Type: Protein-coding gene

### Pathology
The CLEC7A gene has been implicated in a variety of infections and inflammatory conditions. Specifically, it is known to be involved in the recognition and response to fungal infections.

### Function
The CLEC7A gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein known as dectin-1. This protein is a pattern recognition receptor expressed primarily on immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Dectin-1 recognizes and binds to β-glucan, a component of fungal cell walls, triggering an immune response that helps to clear the infection.

### AA Mutation and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several variants in the CLEC7A gene that have been associated with disease. Here are a few examples:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lys42Glu | Missense | rs16910526 |
| Arg98Trp | Missense | rs61733349 |
| Thr238Met | Missense | rs61752436 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported in the CLEC7A gene. Here are a few examples:

| Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- |
| Missense | rs372900511 |
| Frameshift | rs757762772 |
| Nonsense | rs758714180 |

### Related Disease
Variants in the CLEC7A gene have been associated with several disease conditions, including:
- Candidiasis
- Aspergillosis
- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
- Inflammatory bowel disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for CLEC7A-related diseases, but antifungal medications are often used to treat fungal infections associated with these conditions.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response related to variants in the CLEC7A gene.
