# Information on Gene NEUROD1

## General Information
- Gene: NEUROD1
- Location: Chromosome 2: 87,494,793-87,515,740
- Aliases: BETA2, MODY6

## Function of Gene
NEUROD1 gene encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. It is expressed in the developing and mature nervous system and helps in the differentiation and maturation of neurons. It is also involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in NEUROD1 gene have been associated with the development of several diseases, including:
- Diabetes Mellitus, MODY type 6 (MODY6)
- Pancreatic cancer
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for MODY6 but management includes lifestyle changes such as controlling weight, following a healthy diet and regular physical exercise. In the case of cancer, treatment varies depending on the stage of the disease. It may include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to NEUROD1 gene. However, a study showed that some compounds such as leptin and lithium may modify the expression of NEUROD1 target genes.
