## Gene: CECR2
### Genetic Position
CECR2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 11.23 (22q11.23).

### Pathology
CECR2 is associated with mental retardation, autistic features, epilepsy, and craniofacial dysmorphology syndrome. Mutations in the CECR2 gene have been found in individuals with this syndrome which is also known as Goldberg-Shprintzen Syndrome.

### Function
The CECR2 gene encodes adenosine deaminase-like protein which plays an important role in purine metabolism. It is involved in the regulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine levels in cells.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID currently.

### Related Disease
Goldberg-Shprintzen Syndrome is caused by mutations in the CECR2 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for Goldberg-Shprintzen Syndrome. Treatment is mainly supportive which includes special education, speech therapy, and physiotherapy. The prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response for Goldberg-Shprintzen Syndrome.
