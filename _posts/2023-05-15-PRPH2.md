## Analysis of PRPH2 gene

### Gene information

- Gene: PRPH2 (Peripherin-2)
- Function: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tetraspanin family of membrane proteins. This protein plays a role in the structure and function of the outer segment of rod photoreceptors. Mutations in this gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa type 7 (RP7) and macular degeneration.

### Treatment and prognosis

- There is currently no cure for RP7, but treatments such as vitamin A supplementation and gene therapy are being studied.
- The prognosis for RP7 varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

### Drug response

- There is currently no known drug response for mutations in PRPH2.
