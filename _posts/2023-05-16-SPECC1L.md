## Information about Gene SPECC1L

### Genetic Position
SPECC1L, also known as Sperm Antigen with Calponin Homology and Coiled-Coil Domains 1 Like, is located on chromosome 22q13.33.

### Pathology
Mutations in SPECC1L have been associated with a range of developmental disorders, including Oblique facial cleft 1, Developmental delay with behavioral abnormalities and Obesity, and Congenital heart defects, Hirschsprung disease, and Choanal atresia, with or without Defending syndrome (CHARGE). 

### Function
SPECC1L is involved in several cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, microtubule organization, and protein localization. Specifically, it helps regulate mitotic spindle orientation and asymmetric division in neural progenitors and is essential for normal embryonic development.
