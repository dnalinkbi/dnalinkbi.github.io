# Gene RDH5

## Information about the gene

**Pathology:** The RDH5 gene encodes an enzyme called retinol dehydrogenase 5, which is involved in the visual cycle and is responsible for the conversion of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. Mutations in this gene are associated with fundus albipunctatus, a recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness.

**Function:** The RDH5 enzyme plays a vital role in the visual cycle by converting all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal.

**Aliases:** RDH6, SDR9C6, MGC120853, FLJ21027, RETDS

## Related disease

Mutations in the RDH5 gene are associated with fundus albipunctatus, which is a recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness. This disease is characterized by impaired night vision and the presence of white-yellow spots in the retina.

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for fundus albipunctatus. However, dietary supplementation with vitamin A has been shown to improve night vision in affected individuals.

## Drug response

No specific drugs targeting RDH5 have been developed yet.
