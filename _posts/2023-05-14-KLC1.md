## Gene: KLC1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 14
- Gene locus: 14q32.31

### Pathology
- KLC1 has been implicated in several pathologies, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2 (CMT2).

### Function
- KLC1 encodes a protein called kinesin light chain 1, which is involved in intracellular transport.
- KLC1 interacts with kinesin heavy chain to form a kinesin-1 motor, which transports cargo along microtubules.
- The protein is critical for the retrograde axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and contributes to the maintenance of synaptic function.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6346
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 3831
- Ensembl Gene: ENSG00000100985
- OMIM: 604395
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q07866
- Other aliases: KLC2, KNS2

### AA Mutation List with Mutation Types and dbSNP IDs
- p.Asn340Ser (missense) - rs137854202
- p.Arg170His (missense) - rs137854203
- p.Thr92Met (missense) - rs80338939

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs
- c.18_19del (frameshift) - rs757617508
- c.522_525del (frameshift) - rs1057519606
- c.833C>A (missense) - rs75151161

### Related Diseases
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2
- Alzheimer's Disease
- Various Cancers including Breast Cancer and Colorectal Cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for diseases related to KLC1 dysfunction is largely symptomatic and varies depending on the specific disease and its severity.
- Prognosis is also variable depending on the disease, its severity, and the individual affected.

### Drug Response
- Studies have identified potential target molecules for drug development based on KLC1-related pathways, but no specific drugs have been developed as yet.
