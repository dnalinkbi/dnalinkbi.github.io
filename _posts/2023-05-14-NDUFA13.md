# Gene: NDUFA13

## Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome X: 154,515,688-154,553,304
- **Pathology:** Mutations in this gene have been associated with Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial complex I deficiency.
- **Function:** This gene encodes a subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex which is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The complex I subunit encoded by this gene is required for the assembly of the complex and for the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain.
