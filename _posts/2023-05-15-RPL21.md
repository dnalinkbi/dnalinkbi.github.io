## Gene RPL21 

### Genetic position, Aliases, and External IDs
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 3q29, 61,315,095 - 61,318,787 bp 
- **Aliases:** 
    - 60S ribosomal protein L21
    - Ribosomal protein L21
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC:10473
    - NCBI Entrez: 6145 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000114650
    - OMIM: 180481
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P33981

### Function 
RPL21 is an essential component of the 60S ribosomal subunit, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by helping to form peptide bonds between amino acids during translation. Specifically, RPL21 is involved in maintaining the proper structure of the ribosome and in positioning the peptidyl transferase center where peptide bond formation occurs.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- No disease-associated AA mutations have been reported for RPL21 in ClinVar or HGMD.
- However, several non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the RPL21 gene:
    - rs3745556: p.Val226Ile 
    - rs283857: p.Asp82Asn  
- These SNPs are classified as benign or likely benign by ClinVar and have not been reported to contribute to any disease phenotype.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Somatic mutations have been reported in RPL21 in various cancer types, including lung cancer and bladder cancer. 
- Some of the reported mutations in RPL21 include:
    - rs41284450: p.Arg98Gln 
    - rs74708380: p.Arg54* 
    - rs201836308: p.Arg60Gly  
- These mutations are associated with cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and resistance to chemotherapy.

### Related disease
- Mutations in the RPL21 gene have not been directly linked to any disease phenotype. 
- However, somatically acquired mutations in RPL21 are associated with various types of cancer, such as lung cancer and bladder cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis
- There is no specific treatment for RPL21 mutations or dysregulation. 
- Since somatic mutations in RPL21 are often associated with cancer, treatment typically involves standard cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
- Prognosis for cancer patients with RPL21 mutations can vary depending on the cancer type and stage of the disease.

### Drug response
- There is no data available on drug response specific to RPL21 mutations. 
- However, some studies suggest that RPL21 may potentially be a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
