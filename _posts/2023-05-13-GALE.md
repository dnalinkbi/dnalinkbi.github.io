# Information about gene GALE

## Genetic Position and Aliases
Gene GALE is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p36.11. It is also known by the aliases UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and GALEH.

## Function
The GALE gene encodes UDP-galactose epimerase, which is responsible for the interconversion of UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose. These sugar nucleotides play important roles in biosynthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans.

## External IDs and Sites
The external IDs and sites for gene GALE are as follows:

- HGNC: 4165
- NCBI Entrez: 2586
- Ensembl: ENSG00000143148
- OMIM: 606953
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14376

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known amino acid (AA) mutations in the GALE gene, including:

- R229H (rs120074163)
- R266C
- R333H (rs12764840)
- R405W (rs12764842)

These mutations are associated with type III galactosemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects galactose metabolism.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs or InDels associated with the GALE gene.

## Related Disease
As mentioned earlier, mutations in the GALE gene are associated with type III galactosemia. This disorder is characterized by delayed speech, cognitive impairment, and other neurological symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for galactosemia, but affected individuals can be managed with a galactose-restricted diet. The prognosis for galactosemia varies depending on the severity of the condition, but with early intervention and proper management, affected individuals can lead healthy lives.

## Drug Response
There are currently no known drugs that target the GALE gene specifically.
