# Gene SRR

## Genetic Position
The gene SRR is located on chromosome 6p21.1-p12 in humans.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SRR gene have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called sulfite reductase deficiency. This disorder is characterized by neurological symptoms such as seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability.

## Function
The SRR gene encodes sulfite reductase, which is an enzyme involved in the process of sulfur metabolism. Specifically, sulfite reductase catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, which is an important step in the synthesis of cysteine, an essential amino acid.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are many reported mutations in the SRR gene associated with sulfite reductase deficiency. Some examples of missense mutations and their dbSNP IDs include:

- p.Val305Gly (rs121918007)
- p.Arg390Ser (rs137853778)
- p.Arg161Gln (rs781594358)
- p.Asn310Ser (rs121918008)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is limited information about somatic mutations in the SRR gene. One study reported a somatic missense mutation, p.Arg541Cys (rs772407414), in a patient with a brain tumor.

## Related Disease
The SRR gene is primarily associated with sulfite reductase deficiency, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. However, some studies have also suggested that the SRR gene may play a role in the development of cancers, such as brain tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for sulfite reductase deficiency, and treatment is usually supportive and focused on managing symptoms. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information about drug responses specific to mutations in the SRR gene.
