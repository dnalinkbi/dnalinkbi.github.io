# Gene GLB1

## Information

### Gene Position

The GLB1 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the locus 3p22.3.

### Pathology

Variations of the GLB1 gene can lead to multiple diseases, including GM1-gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disease that causes progressive neurodegeneration.

### Function

The GLB1 gene encodes for beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that breaks down complex sugars in lysosomes.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type 

The following is a list of amino acid mutations for the GLB1 gene, their mutation type, and corresponding dbSNP IDs:

| Amino Acid Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| R201H | Missense | rs28935478 |
| R201C | Missense | rs80338823 |
| L620P | Missense | rs758528585 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels for the GLB1 gene.

### Related Diseases

Variations of the GLB1 gene can cause several diseases, including:

- GM1-gangliosidosis, type I
- GM1-gangliosidosis, type II
- GM1-gangliosidosis, type III

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for GM1-gangliosidosis, and treatment options are limited to supportive care to manage symptoms. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease but is generally poor.

### Drug Response

There is currently no drug that can treat the underlying cause of GM1-gangliosidosis. Symptomatic treatment may include medications to control seizures or muscle spasms.
