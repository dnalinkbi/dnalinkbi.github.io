# Gene: SPEF2

## Genetic Position and Pathology

- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 5: 70708744-70884958 (+ strand)
- **Pathologies:** SPEF2 has been found to be associated with several pathological conditions, including male infertility, ciliary dyskinesia, and several types of cancer.

## Function for gene
SPEF2 encodes a protein called sperm flagellar 2, which plays an important role in regulating cilia and flagellar function, particularly in sperm cells.

- c.3274C>T; p.Arg1092Trp(rs145999252)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- c.2T>C; p.Met1Thr(rs113994228)

## Related disease
- **Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD):** SPEF2 mutations have been found to be associated with PCD, a rare genetic condition characterized by chronic respiratory infections, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.
- **Male Infertility:** Mutations in SPEF2 have been linked to male infertility, particularly due to defects in sperm motility.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for PCD is largely supportive and aims to improve respiratory symptoms and prevent complications. No specific targeted treatments for SPEF2 mutations have been developed yet.

## Drug Response
There is currently no data available on drug response related to SPEF2 mutations.
