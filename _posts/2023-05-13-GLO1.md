## Gene GLO1 Information

### Genetic Position

The gene GLO1 is located on chromosome 6p21.2.

### Pathology

The GLO1 gene has been associated with various diseases, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. It has also been linked to diabetic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy.

### Function

The GLO1 gene encodes for the enzyme glyoxalase I, which is responsible for detoxifying methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic metabolite of glucose metabolism. The glyoxalase system is essential for cellular defense against oxidative stress.
