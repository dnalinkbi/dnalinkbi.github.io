# Gene: SEPN1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: p36.13
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): 19,511,529 - 19,578,950

## Pathology and Function
- Pathology: SEPN1 is associated with several diseases including rigid spine muscular dystrophy and multiminicore disease.
- Function: SEPN1 encodes a selenoprotein involved in oxidative stress response and calcium regulation in muscle cells. It also plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of skeletal muscle.
