# Information about Gene FFAR4

## Genetic Position
The FFAR4 gene is located on chromosome 10q24.31. It spans a genomic region of approximately 11kb.

## Pathology and Function
The FFAR4 gene is also known as Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4 or G-protein Coupled Receptor 120 (GPR120). It encodes a protein that functions as a receptor for long-chain free fatty acids. The binding of specific fatty acids to FFAR4 on adipocytes, macrophages, and other cells can activate signaling pathways that regulate glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation.

FFAR4 is associated with various diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory disorders.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the FFAR4 gene. The following are some of the AA mutations with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| V290M | Missense | rs1693482 |
| A55V | Missense | rs61735682 |
| A219V | Missense | rs201925930 |
| V368M | Missense | rs1693484 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are also somatic mutations identified in the FFAR4 gene. However, no SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID were found in public repositories.

## Related Disease
Several studies have linked FFAR4 to various diseases, including:
- Obesity
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease
- Atherosclerosis

## Treatment and Prognosis
Activation of FFAR4 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of targeting FFAR4 in treating these diseases.

## Drug Response
Studies have identified specific small molecule agonists that can activate FFAR4 and improve glucose homeostasis. However, no drugs targeting FFAR4 have been approved for clinical use.
