# Information about gene CFTR

## Genetic position
CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31.2). 

## Pathology
Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to cystic fibrosis (CF), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. CF affects multiple organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and intestines, causing chronic respiratory infections, digestive problems, and infertility. 

## Function
The CFTR gene encodes a membrane-bound ion channel that regulates the transport of ions and water across epithelial tissues lining the airways, sweat glands, and pancreas. The CFTR protein has ATPase activity and acts as a chloride channel, regulating the movement of chloride ions in and out of cells.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported in the CFTR gene.

## Related disease
Cystic fibrosis is the primary disease associated with CFTR gene mutations. Other conditions, such as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens and chronic bronchitis, are also linked to CFTR dysfunction.

## Treatment and prognosis
Current therapies for CF focus on improving respiratory and digestive symptoms and managing complications. These treatments include antibiotics, mucolytics, bronchodilators, and pancreatic enzyme replacement. Recently, new drugs such as CFTR modulators that improve the function of mutated CFTR proteins have been approved for use. The prognosis for CF patients has improved significantly with the introduction of these new treatments.

## Drug response
CFTR modulators, such as ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, have shown promising results in improving lung function and reducing respiratory infections in CF patients with specific mutations.
