## Gene: COL18A1

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 21
- Start: 35,933,307 bp
- End: 36,044,857 bp 

### Function:
COL18A1 gene encodes for a type XVIII collagen protein, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) found in various tissues such as cornea, lung, and skin. This protein is involved in angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and migration.

### Related Disease:
COL18A1 mutations have been associated with Knobloch syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifested by retinal detachment and occipital skull defect.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no specific treatment available for Knobloch syndrome. Ophthalmologic interventions such as surgery may help manage retinal detachments. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and timely management of complications.

### Drug Response:
Information on drug response is currently not available.
