## Gene: 

ACKR1

## Function: 

ACKR1, also known as DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines), is a glycosylated protein that belongs to the family of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This protein functions as a receptor for various chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), and plays a role in regulating chemotaxis and inflammation.

- Ensembl: ENSG00000117748
- OMIM: 110700
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16570
- Aliases: Duffy blood group antigen, SR-PSOX, CD234 antigen

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type (dbSNP ID): 

- p.G42D (rs2814778)
- p.V45L (rs12075)
- p.Q95H (rs7912176)
- p.R142K (rs2814779)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: 

- c.322G>A (rs34557427)

## Related Disease: 

Mutations in the ACKR1 gene can lead to altered chemokine response, which has been linked to several diseases, including HIV infection, malaria, and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis: 

Currently, there is no specific treatment for ACKR1-related diseases, but studies are ongoing to investigate the potential therapeutic applications of targeting ACKR1.

## Drug Response: 

ACKR1 is involved in the regulation of chemotaxis and inflammation, making it a potential target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.
