## Gene PPP1R13L

### Genetic position

PPP1R13L (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 13 like) is located on chromosome 19q13.32.

### Pathology

PPP1R13L is associated with certain cancers such as breast and lung cancers. Mutations in this gene have also been linked to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Function

PPP1R13L is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cytokinesis, apoptosis, and DNA damage response.

### Related disease

PPP1R13L is associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, breast cancer, and lung cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis

There is no known cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but treatments such as pulmonary rehabilitation and the use of oxygen can help manage symptoms. The prognosis for patients with PPP1R13L mutations depends on various factors such as the specific mutation and the type of cancer.

### Drug response

There is no known drug response specifically for PPP1R13L mutations, but treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often used in cancer treatment.
