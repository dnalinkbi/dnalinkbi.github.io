# Gene GP6

## Genetic Position
GP6 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.2.

## Pathology
Genetic variations in GP6 gene are associated with the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is a common type of cardiovascular disease that affects the arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

## Function for Gene
GP6 gene encodes a protein called platelet glycoprotein VI, which is a receptor for collagen on the surface of platelets. The receptor plays a key role in platelet activation and aggregation, which are important for the normal process of blood coagulation.

Aliases: GP6D, GPVI, GPVI-2

## AA Mutation list and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Some of the non-synonymous variants in GP6 gene associated with CAD are:
- Met89Val (rs1613662)
- Ser219Gly (rs2269827)
- Thr261Met (rs267607015)
- Lys248Arg (rs139591174)
- His281Gln (rs148530083)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in GP6 gene.

## Related Disease
Genetic variations in GP6 gene have been linked to several diseases, including:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)
- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for CAD and ACS depend on the severity of the disease. Lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery may be required to manage the symptoms and prevent complications.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response associated with GP6 gene variations.
