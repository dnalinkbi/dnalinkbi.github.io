## Information about Gene IKBKB

### Genetic Position
The IKBKB gene is located on chromosome 8q22.2.

### Pathology
- Mutations in the IKBKB gene have been associated with immune disorders, including susceptibility to viral infections.
- Overexpression of IKBKB has been observed in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma.

### Function
The IKBKB gene encodes a protein called Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Kinase Subunit Beta (IKKβ), which plays a key role in the canonical NF-κB pathway. This pathway regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, immune response, and cell survival.

### Related Disease
- Immunodeficiency 44 (IMD44) - caused by mutations in the IKBKB gene
- Cancer - overexpression of IKBKB has been observed in various types of cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for IMD44 include antiviral therapy, gene therapy, and stem cell transplantation.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the immune disorder and the response to treatment.

### Drug Response
- The IKKβ protein is a promising target for the development of anti-inflammatory and anticancer drugs.
