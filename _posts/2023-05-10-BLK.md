## Gene BLK

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 8, q24.12

**Pathology:** Blk mutations have been linked to the development of lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease.

**Function:** The BLK gene encodes the B-lymphocyte kinase, a protein that is involved in B-cell receptor signaling. It plays a role in the survival and proliferation of B-cells.

**External IDs:**
- Gene ID: 640
- Genomic Location: NC_000008.11 (74429437..74549703)
- Aliases: LYK

**External Sites:**
- HGNC: 1068
- NCBI Entrez: 640
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104375
- OMIM: 191305
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51451

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- R358Q - Missense - rs34557432
- A71V - Missense - rs142288928

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- No record found

**Related Disease:** Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment of SLE includes cytotoxic drugs, corticosteroids, and antimalarials. Patients with SLE have variable clinical outcomes ranging from early remission to chronic progressive disease.

**Drug Response:** BLK inhibitors have not been developed yet.
