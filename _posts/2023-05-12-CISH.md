# Information about Gene CISH

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location

- **Gene Name**: CISH
- **Chromosome**: 3
- **Location**: 3p21.31

## Pathology and Function

- **Function for Gene**: The Cytokine-Inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) is a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, which means it inhibits the signaling pathways of different cytokines to suppress their activity. It is involved in the regulation of immune response, hematopoiesis, and other cellular processes. 

- **Aliases**: CIS, G18, Cish1

- **External IDs**:
	- HGNC: 2096
	- NCBI Entrez: 11514
	- Ensembl: ENSG00000197170
	- OMIM: 605211
	- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NSE2

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: 
There are several missense mutations reported in CISH gene, such as: 
	- c.96G>A (p.Glu32Lys) rs2239751
	- c.214G>A (p. Gly72Arg) rs414171
	- c.473A>G (p.Asn158Ser) rs2071348

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
There are somatic mutations reported in CISH gene, like:
	- c.233G>A (p.Ala78Thr) rs757179283
	- c.287C>A (p.Ala96Asp) rs376828676

## Related Disease

- **Disease**: Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- **Relation**: The CISH gene variants are associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. The CISH gene overexpression is related to a lower risk of developing MS.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment**: CISH is a potent therapeutic target for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as MS. A CISH antagonist may provide a new and effective therapy for these diseases by enhancing T cell activity and cytokine signaling.

- **Prognosis**: The overexpression of CISH is associated with poor prognosis in different types of cancer, whereas the down-regulation of CISH is related to better survival of patients with cancer.

## Drug Response

- **Drug**: Tofacitinib 
- **Response**: Tofacitinib is a CISH-targeting drug that enhances cytokine signaling and T cell activation. It is effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and some other autoimmune diseases.
