# Information on Gene MT-ND4

## Gene Position, Pathology and Function
The MT-ND4 gene is located on the mitochondrial genome at position 10,433-10,955. It encodes for a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase, which is a part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex plays an important role in the synthesis of ATP molecules during oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in the MT-ND4 gene have been associated with various diseases such as Leigh syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and exercise intolerance.

## Gene Function
The primary function of the MT-ND4 gene is to encode a subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase enzyme, which is involved in the electron transport chain. This is a critical process in the production of ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation.
