## Gene: DPAGT1

### Information

- **Pathology:** Mutations in DPAGT1 have been linked to autosomal recessive congential disorder, characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and hypotonia. 
- **Function:** DPAGT1 encodes for an enzyme called Dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase, which is involved in glycosylation pathways. 
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 11, position 14.1 
- **Aliases:** D11S813E, GPT, PGS, C3orf27

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported for DPAGT1 gene.

### Related Disease

- **Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ij (CDG Ij):** It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation, seizures, and hypotonia. Variants in DPAGT1 gene have been found to cause CDG Ij. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

- There is no cure for CDG Ij. Management is focused on treating the symptoms of the disorder.
- Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis for individuals with CDG Ij.

### Drug Response 

- No specific drugs have been approved for the treatment of CDG Ij. However, management of the disorder includes symptomatic treatments such as physical therapy, antiepileptic drugs, and nutritional support.
