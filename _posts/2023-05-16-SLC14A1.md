## Gene: SLC14A1

### Genetic Position:
SLC14A1 gene is located on chromosome 18q12.3.

### Pathology:
A mutation in SLC14A1 gene causes or predisposes to several diseases, including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and anemia.

### Function:
SLC14A1 gene encodes a urea transporter that plays an essential role in the concentration of urine and the maintenance of systemic osmotic balance. It is expressed in the renal collecting duct, inner medullary collecting duct, and vascular endothelial cells of the vasa recta.
