## Information about Gene LRP8

**Pathology:** LRP8 gene encodes a receptor that binds many ligands including lipoprotein, alpha-2-macroglobulin and thrombospondin. The encoded protein plays a role in the clearance of endocytosed proteins as well as the activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta. Mutations in LRP8 gene have been associated with Alzheimer disease type 2, myocardial infarction and late-onset Alzheimer disease.

**Function for gene:** The LRP8 gene is involved in important biological processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and transmembrane transport of ligands across the cell membrane. It also plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular signaling and gene expression.

**Related disease:** Mutations in LRP8 gene have been associated with Alzheimer disease type 2, myocardial infarction and late-onset Alzheimer disease, as mentioned earlier.

**Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment for diseases associated with mutations in LRP8 gene is symptomatic and supportive, as there is no cure for these conditions. Prognosis may vary depending on the specific condition and its severity.

**Drug response:** There is limited information about drug response related to LRP8 gene mutations.
