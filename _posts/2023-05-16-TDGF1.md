# **Information on Gene TDGF1**

## **Genetic Position**

The TDGF1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q27). It spans over 40,000 base pairs and contains 5 exons.

## **Pathology**

TDGF1 is known to be overexpressed in various cancers, including gastric, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers. It has been proposed to play a role in tumor development and progression. 

## **Function**

TDGF1 is a signaling molecule that plays a key role in early embryonic development. It is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. TDGF1 is also important for the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells and is thought to have therapeutic potential for regenerative medicine.

## **Related Disease**

The TDGF1 gene is associated with various cancers, including gastric, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers.

## **Treatment and prognosis**

No specific treatment is available to target TDGF1 for cancers yet. However, studies have shown that blocking TDGF1 signaling can inhibit tumor growth and progression. Prognosis may vary depending on the cancer type and stage.

## **Drug response**

There is no specific drug available to target TDGF1 for cancers yet. However, studies are underway to identify inhibitors of TDGF1 signaling.
