# Gene Information for SH2D1A

## Genetic Position
The SH2D1A gene is located on the X chromosome at Xq25.

## Pathology and Function
The SH2D1A gene encodes the SH2D1A protein, which is important for regulating immune response. Mutations in the SH2D1A gene are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 (XLP-1), which can cause severe immune dysregulation and an increased risk of developing lymphoma.

## Related Disease
Mutations in SH2D1A are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 (XLP-1), which is characterized by severe immune dysregulation and an increased risk of developing lymphoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for XLP-1, but treatment options include immunosuppressive medications and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The prognosis for individuals with XLP-1 can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response specific to mutations in SH2D1A.
