# Information about gene RPS19

## Genetic Position

- Gene: RPS19
- Genomic location: 19q13.2
- Chromosome: 19

## Pathology and Function

- Function: Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome, which plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis. RPS19 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and is essential for normal erythropoiesis.
- Pathology: Mutations in the RPS19 gene have been implicated in the development of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia, macrocytosis, and reticulocytopenia.

## External IDs and Aliases

  - HGNC: 10464
  - NCBI Entrez: 6225
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000105647
  - OMIM: 603474
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P39019

- Aliases for RPS19 include DBA1, S19, MGC71791

- Mutation Type: Missense Mutation
- dbSNP IDs:
  - rs80338650
  - rs80338651
  - rs80338652
  - rs80338653

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the RPS19 gene.

## Related Disease

- Related Disease: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA)
- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal Dominant (in some cases) and Autosomal Recessive

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for DBA include blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and bone marrow transplant.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment. Some cases may require lifelong treatment with blood transfusions.

## Drug Response

- There is limited information available about drug response related to mutations in RPS19.
