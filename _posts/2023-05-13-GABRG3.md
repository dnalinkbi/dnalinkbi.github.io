## GABRG3

- **Function:** The GABRG3 gene encodes for one of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits, which are important for neuronal inhibition in the central nervous system.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:**
    - HGNC: 4117
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 2563
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000150720
    - OMIM: 601977
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P28472
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome X: 74,936,991-74,969,102 

- **Aliases:** GABA(A) receptor subunit gamma-3, Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-3

- **AA Mutation List:**
    - p.Arg100His(rs2229944)
    - p.Asp126Asn(rs149542378)
    - p.Val219Ile(rs147245629)
    - p.Glu250Lys(rs147533113)

- **Mutation Type:** Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
    - No somatic mutations have been reported for the GABRG3 gene according to dbSNP.

- **Related Disease:** There is evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the GABRG3 gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy and other neurological disorders.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis for disorders associated with GABRG3 variants depends on the specific disease and mutation.

- **Drug Response:** Drug response to disorders associated with GABRG3 variants depends on the specific disease and mutation.
