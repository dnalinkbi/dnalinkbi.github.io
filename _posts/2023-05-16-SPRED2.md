**Gene:** SPRED2

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 2, band q31.2

**Pathology:** SPRED2 is associated with various diseases including intellectual disability, congenital anomalies, and autism spectrum disorder.

**Function for gene:** SPRED2 encodes a protein that belongs to the Sprouty family of proteins, which play important roles in intracellular signaling pathways. Specifically, SPRED2 acts as a negative regulator of the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. By regulating the MAPK pathway, SPRED2 controls cell growth and differentiation during development.
