# Information about Gene VPS53

## Genomic Position and ID
- Gene: VPS53
- Chromosome: 17
- Genomic coordinates (GRCh38): 17q25.3
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 24611
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 55344
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000141311
    - OMIM: 615791
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5K5
- Aliases: ABY1, KIAA0539, VPS52B, VPS53B

## Function
- The VPS53 gene encodes for a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is involved in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.
- VPS53 also plays a role in autophagy, which is the process by which cells degrade and recycle their own components.

## Related Disease
- VPS53 deficiency: a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, and other features such as brain abnormalities and skeletal anomalies.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for VPS53 deficiency, and treatment is currently supportive and symptomatic, addressing specific symptoms such as seizures.
- Prognosis is generally poor, with affected individuals typically experiencing severe intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other health complications.

## Drug Response
- There is no current information on drug response for VPS53 deficiency.
