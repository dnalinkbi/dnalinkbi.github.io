# Gene KNL1

**Genetic position:** KNL1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q32.1).

**Function:** KNL1 (Kinetochore null 1) is a protein-coding gene that plays a critical role in chromosome segregation during cell division. It acts as a scaffold protein that recruits other proteins to the kinetochore, a structure that forms at the centromere of a chromosome and attaches it to the microtubules of the spindle apparatus.

**Aliases:** CASC5, Blinkin

- HGNC: 24472
- NCBI Entrez: 81930
- Ensembl: ENSG00000162408
- OMIM: 611963
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NBJ4

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- p.R1031H (missense) - rs148094798
- p.L105M (missense) - rs151208527

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- c.4481_4484dup (frameshift) - rs886041082
- c.6607C>T (missense) - rs41268797

**Related disease:** KNL1 mutations have been associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly-13 (MCPH13), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a reduced head circumference and intellectual disability.

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for MCPH13. Treatment is mainly supportive, and patients may benefit from early intervention programs and educational support.

**Drug response:** There is limited information available regarding drug response in MCPH13 patients.
