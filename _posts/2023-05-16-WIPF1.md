### Gene WIPF1

**Genetic Position and Genomic Location**

The WIPF1 gene (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein Interacting Protein 1), also known as WASPIP, is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q31.1.

**Function**

The WIPF1 gene encodes a protein called WIP, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of actin polymerization. Actin polymerization is important for many cellular processes, including cell migration, phagocytosis, and cytokinesis. WIP regulates actin polymerization by interacting with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp), which is also involved in actin dynamics.

- NCBI Entrez Gene: 7456
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116044
- OMIM: 602357
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6W5

Aliases: WASPIP, WIP, WIRE, WIP-1

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**

There are several amino acid mutations reported in the WIPF1 gene, including:

- p.Pro140Leu (rs786205101)
- p.Arg37Cys (rs78537521)
- p.Ser525Leu (rs746685113)

These mutations are associated with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, which is an X-linked disorder characterized by immune deficiency and a tendency to develop eczema and bleeding disorders.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**

There are somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the WIPF1 gene, including:

- c.994C>T (rs797044854)
- c.1006G>A (rs797044853)

**Related Disease and Prognosis**

Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system and causes a range of symptoms, including recurrent infections, eczema, and bleeding disorders. WAS is caused by mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) gene, which is involved in actin dynamics. Mutations in the WIPF1 gene, which interacts with WASp, can also cause a milder form of the disease.

The prognosis for individuals with WAS can vary depending on the severity of the symptoms. Treatment may include stem cell transplantation, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and antibiotics to prevent infections.

**Drug Response**

There are currently no drugs available specifically for the treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. However, treatment with immunoglobulin replacement therapy can help to reduce the risk of infections in affected individuals.
