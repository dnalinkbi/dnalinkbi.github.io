# Gene KIAA0586

## Genetic position
KIAA0586 is a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q23.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in KIAA0586 have been associated with a neurological disorder called Joubert syndrome.

## Function
The KIAA0586 protein is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a role in various biological processes such as sensing and signaling.
