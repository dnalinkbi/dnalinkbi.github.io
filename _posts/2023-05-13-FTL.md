# Gene FTL

### Description:
FTL (Ferritin Light Chain) gene encodes one subunit of a ferritin complex. The ferritin protein complex plays a crucial role in iron metabolism by controlling the levels of intracellular iron.

### Function:
The FTL gene encodes the light subunit of ferritin protein complex. This protein complex plays a vital role in the regulation of intracellular iron levels, preventing damage caused by excess free iron.
