# Information about gene RLBP1

## Genetic Position
The RLBP1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 26.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in RLBP1 gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited disease that causes progressive vision loss. 

## Function
RLBP1 encodes CRALBP (Cellular Retinaldehyde-Binding Protein), a protein that binds to and facilitates the transport of 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinaldehyde. This protein is essential for the normal functioning of the visual cycle.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
None reported.

## Related Disease
- Retinitis pigmentosa: RP is a genetic disease that causes progressive vision loss due to the death of photoreceptor cells in the retina. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for RP, but there are treatment options that can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. These treatments include the use of low-vision aids, such as magnifying glasses and telescopes, and gene therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is no drug specifically targeted at the RLBP1 gene for RP treatment. However, some drugs can slow the rate of vision loss, such as vitamin A palmitate supplements.
