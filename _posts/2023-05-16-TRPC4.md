# Information about gene TRPC4

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome Xq23

**Function for gene:** The TRPC4 gene encodes a calcium permeable channel protein and is involved in calcium signaling, which regulates various cellular functions such as muscle contraction, gene expression, and synaptic transmission.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

Currently, there are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in TRPC4 gene.

**Related Disease:** TRPC4 is associated with several diseases, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and ischemia/reperfusion injury.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no known cure or treatment for TRPC4 gene-associated diseases. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.

**Drug Response:** There are no known drugs that specifically target TRPC4 gene. However, some drugs that target calcium signaling are being investigated for their potential use in treating TRPC4-associated diseases.
