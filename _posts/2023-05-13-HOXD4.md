## Gene HOXD4
HOXD4 is a homeobox gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the development of body axis and limb development. The gene is located on chromosome 2 at the position 2q31.1 and transcribed into a mRNA of 1,165 base pairs. 

### Function
HOXD4 is involved in limb development and specifies the position of digits along the limb axis. The gene also functions in patterning of the trunk and axial skeleton.

### External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC:5139, NCBI Entrez Gene:3239, Ensembl:ENSG00000115415, OMIM:142974, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P09017
- Aliases: HOX4, HOX4E

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations reported in the HOXD4 gene that include:
- c.479C>T (p.Pro160Ser) - rs752401616
- c.577C>A (p.Ser193Arg) - rs111746562
- c.661G>A (p.Ala221Thr) - rs758856773

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are some somatic mutations in the HOXD4 gene reported in the COSMIC database with dbSNP ID as follows:
- c.641C>T (p.Leu214Phe) - COSM141017

### Related diseases
Mutations in HOXD4 are associated with several diseases, including:
- Syndactyly, type V
- Brachydactyly, type A1

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no definitive treatment for genetic disorders caused by HOXD4 mutations. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, with surgery in some cases. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the specific symptoms.

### Drug response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets mutations in the HOXD4 gene.
