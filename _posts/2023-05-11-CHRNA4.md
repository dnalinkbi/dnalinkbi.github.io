# Information about Gene CHRNA4

## Genetic Position

The CHRNA4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 at position 13.2 (20q13.2)

## Pathology

The CHRNA4 gene has been associated with various pathological conditions such as nicotine addiction, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Function

The CHRNA4 gene encodes for the alpha-4 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which plays a crucial role in the cholinergic neurotransmission system. Specifically, the alpha-4 subunit is responsible for binding acetylcholine to the receptor and initiating a cellular response.

There are some examples of somatic SNVs/INDELs in CHRNA4 gene:

|Variation|dbSNP ID|
|---------|--------|
|c.590G>A|rs142879791|
|c.1127C>T|rs1800709|

## Related Diseases

The following diseases are connected with the CHRNA4 gene:

- Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy
- Childhood absence epilepsy
- Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for CHRNA4 gene-associated disorders. However, symptom management and routine monitoring can be beneficial for epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Drug Response

Several studies have suggested that drugs targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly alpha-4 subtype, may be beneficial in the treatment of nicotine addiction, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders.
