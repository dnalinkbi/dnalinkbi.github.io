# Information about gene NKX3-2:

## Genetic Position:
- The NKX3-2 gene is located on chromosome 20p11.23. 

## Pathology:
- NKX3-2 is associated with multiple skeletal dysplasias, such as spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type 1 (SMDJ1) and a subset of autosomal dominant brachydactyly types BD-1, BD-2, and BD-4. 

## Function for gene:
- The NKX3-2 gene is involved in skeletal development and differentiation of chondrocytes.

## External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:
- External IDs: HGNC:7749, NCBI Entrez:4825, Ensembl:ENSG00000196671, OMIM:603816
- Aliases: BAPX1, NKX3B

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- c.424G>C (p.Arg142Pro) - rs113994084
- c.425C>T (p.Arg142Cys) - rs730880138
- c.434G>A (p.Ala145Thr) - rs121918581

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in NKX3-2.

## Related disease:
- Multiple skeletal dysplasias, including spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type 1 (SMDJ1) and a subset of autosomal dominant brachydactyly types BD-1, BD-2, and BD-4.

## Treatment and prognosis:
- Treatment options are limited to supportive management of the underlying skeletal dysplasia. 
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the skeletal dysplasia but can range from asymptomatic individuals to severe cases requiring surgical intervention.

## Drug response:
- There are currently no known drugs that directly target NKX3-2.
