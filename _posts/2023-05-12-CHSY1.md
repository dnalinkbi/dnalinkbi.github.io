# Information about Gene CHSY1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 15
- Location: 15q26.1

## Pathology
Gene CHSY1 is associated with various pathological conditions. Mutations in this gene are a rare cause of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a heritable disorder of connective tissue. CHSY1 is also associated with various forms of cancer, including breast and liver cancer.

## Function 
The CHSY1 gene encodes chondroitin sulfate synthase-1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a component of extracellular matrix proteoglycans. The synthesis of chondroitin sulfate plays a vital role in embryonic development, cell growth, and repair processes.

## Related Disease
- Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome 
- Breast Cancer
- Liver Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome or cancer caused by CHSY1 mutations. Treatment for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome focuses on managing symptoms and complications. The prognosis for cancer caused by CHSY1 mutations is generally poor, and treatment options are limited.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response of CHSY1 gene mutations.
