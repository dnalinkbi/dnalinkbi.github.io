## Information about gene USH2A

### Genetic position:
The USH2A gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1, specifically at position 1q41. 

### Pathology:
Various mutations in the USH2A gene have been linked to the development of Usher syndrome type II and retinitis pigmentosa. 

### Function:
The USH2A gene codes for the protein usherin, which is involved in the development and maintenance of sensory cells in the retina and inner ear.

### External IDs:
- NCBI Entrez: 7399
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104855
- HGNC: 12527
- OMIM: 608400
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9P0T2

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Gly4676Asp (missense) rs61747437
- p.Phe3379Leu (missense) rs398123093
- p.Arg4191Trp (missense) rs2037955
- p.Arg543Trp (missense) rs104894055

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
None reported.

### Related disease:
Mutations in the USH2A gene have been linked to Usher syndrome type II and retinitis pigmentosa.

### Treatment and prognosis:
There is currently no cure for Usher syndrome type II or retinitis pigmentosa. Management typically involves supportive measures such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and low vision aids.

### Drug response:
Currently, there are no specific drugs to treat Usher syndrome type II or retinitis pigmentosa caused by USH2A mutations. However, there are ongoing clinical trials investigating potential therapies.
