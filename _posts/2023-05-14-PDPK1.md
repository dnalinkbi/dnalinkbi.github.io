# Information about Gene PDPK1

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

The PDPK1 gene, also known as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, is located on chromosome 16 at position 16p13.3. This gene has a key role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway that regulates various cellular processes such as survival, growth, and metabolism.

Mutations in the PDPK1 gene have been associated with different diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders, due to their impact on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

## Function for Gene 

The PDPK1 gene encodes a protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates serine/threonine kinases, including AKT and SGK, that play crucial roles in cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. This gene is involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, and its dysregulation has been associated with insulin resistance and diabetes.
