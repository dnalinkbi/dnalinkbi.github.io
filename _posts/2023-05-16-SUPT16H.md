### Gene SUPT16H

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 14q13.3

**Pathology:** SUPT16H has been associated with several diseases, including viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It has been found that the expression of SUPT16H is dysregulated in some cancers, contributing to tumor development and progression.

**Function:** SUPT16H encodes a protein called SPT16, which is a subunit of the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex. SPT16 plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the movement of RNA polymerase II along the chromatin during transcription.

**External IDs and Aliases:** 
- HGNC: 11380
- NCBI Entrez: 11198
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100804
- OMIM: 602591
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q92800

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- There are several missense mutations reported in the SUPT16H gene. Some of them include:
    - p.Ser1010Phe (rs79925397)
    - p.Arg426Cys (rs146532889)
    - p.Glu409Asp (rs140747673)
- These mutations are mostly reported in the ExAC and gnomAD databases.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- There are several somatic mutations reported in the SUPT16H gene associated with different cancers, including:
    - c.2493C>A (rs764459682)
    - c.946A>T (rs566242830)
    - c.1458A>G (rs746238144)

**Related disease:** SUPT16H has been implicated in several diseases such as chronic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cervical cancer, and prostate cancer.

**Treatment and prognosis:** No specific treatment is available for SUPT16H-related disorders yet. However, the identification of SUPT16H dysregulation in cancer may make it a potential target for future cancer therapies.

**Drug response:** Currently, there is no known drug response for SUPT16H-related disorders.
