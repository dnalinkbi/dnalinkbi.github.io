# Analysis of Gene LRIG2

## Gene information
LRIG2 is a gene that is located on chromosome 1q23.3. It is also known by its alternate name LIG2. The gene encodes for a protein with a length of 1,139 amino acids.

## Pathology and function
The LRIG2 gene is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, and lung. The LRIG2 protein has been found to have a potential role in the development of cancer, particularly in the progression of gliomas.
