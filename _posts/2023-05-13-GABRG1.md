## Information about Gene GABRG1

### Pathology

GABRG1 is associated with several neurological disorders, including epilepsy and autism. Mutations in this gene can lead to altered GABA-A receptor function, causing abnormal neural activity.

### Function

GABRG1 encodes a protein subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is important for inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. The GABA-A receptor is a pentameric protein complex composed of five subunits, which include two α, two β, and one γ subunit. The GABRG1 gene encodes the γ subunit and is required for the formation of functional GABA-A receptors.

### External IDs and Genomic Location

- HGNC: 4166
- NCBI Entrez: 2567
- Ensembl: ENSG00000129673
- OMIM: 137163
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P18507

GABRG1 is located on chromosome 4 (4p12).

### Aliases

- Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-1
- GABA(A) receptor subunit gamma-1
- MGC29056

### AA Mutation List and Types

- A46T (rs76939205)
- R77H (rs771336086)
- P83S (rs782605509)
- V94M (rs786205094)
- P120L (rs778957603)
- P200L (rs782686031)

All of these variants are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic mutations in GABRG1 listed in dbSNP.

### Related Disease

GABRG1 is associated with several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, febrile seizures, and autism spectrum disorder.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for epilepsy and other neurological disorders associated with GABRG1 mutations typically involves the use of antiepileptic drugs and other medications that target neurotransmitter signaling. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response

There is currently limited information available on drug response specifically related to GABRG1 mutations.
