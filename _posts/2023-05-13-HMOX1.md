# Gene Information for HMOX1  

### Gene Position and Pathology   

- HMOX1 gene is located on chromosome 22q12.1. 
- It is associated with several pathologies including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. 

### Gene Function     

- Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron. 
- Its primary function is to protect cells from oxidative stress caused by free heme molecules. 

### External IDs, Genomic Location, and Aliases   

- External IDs: HGNC: 5006, NCBI Gene: 3162, Ensembl: ENSG00000100292, OMIM: 141250  
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 22q12.1 
- Aliases: HO-1
