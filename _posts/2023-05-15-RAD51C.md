# Information about gene RAD51C

## Genetic Position
- RAD51C gene is located on Chromosome 17q22
- The genomic location of RAD51C spans from 64,034,563 bp to 64,113,891 bp

## Pathology
- RAD51C is associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Fanconi anemia, type O (FA-O)
- RAD51C mutations have also been linked to increased risk for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome

## Function
- RAD51C plays a critical role in DNA repair, particularly in the homologous recombination pathway
- It is involved in the recruitment and assembly of RAD51 protein at DNA double-strand breaks

## External IDs
- Gene ID: 5889
- HGNC: 9784
- NCBI Entrez: 5889
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138831
- OMIM: 602774
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43502

- rs10425352
- rs142767862
- rs144934786
- rs150191299
- rs372995931

## Related Disease
- Fanconi anemia, type O (FA-O)
- Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure for FA-O, but hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be used to treat the bone marrow failure associated with the disorder
- Individuals with RAD51C mutations who are at increased risk for HBOC syndrome can consider risk-reducing strategies such as prophylactic surgeries or increased cancer screening

## Drug Response
- There is currently no targeted therapy for RAD51C-associated diseases
