# Information about Gene ZCCHC12

## Genetic Position
The gene ZCCHC12 is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at the position 14q21.1.

## Pathology
There is currently limited knowledge about the pathology associated with mutations in the ZCCHC12 gene.

## Function
The ZCCHC12 gene encodes for a zinc finger CCHC domain-containing protein that is involved in RNA processing. It is thought to play a role in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
