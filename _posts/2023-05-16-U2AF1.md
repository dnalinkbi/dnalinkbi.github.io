## Information about Gene U2AF1

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- The U2AF1 gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3.
- Pathology: Mutations in U2AF1 have been associated with different cancers, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.
- Function: The U2AF1 gene encodes for the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 1, which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
