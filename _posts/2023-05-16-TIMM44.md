# Information about gene TIMM44 

## Genetic Position
TIMM44 is located on chromosome 19q13.33, from base pair 52,523,230 to 52,594,456 [1].

## Pathology and Function
The TIMM44 gene encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein that functions as a crucial subunit of the mitochondrial inner membrane translocase complex. This complex is responsible for the import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondrial matrix [2]. Mutations in the TIMM44 gene have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases [3].

## AA mutation list and types with dbSNP ID
Several SNPs have been identified in the TIMM44 gene that lead to amino acid changes:

| Amino acid change | SNP ID      | Mutation type |
| -----------------|------------| ------------- |
|Val18Ile          | rs2229377  | missense      |
| Gly182Arg        | rs17853393 | missense      |
| Arg218Trp        | rs11963319 |missense       |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are 154 somatic mutations reported in the TIMM44 gene, including SNV and Indels, with dbSNP IDs available.

## Related Disease, Treatment and Prognosis
Mutations in TIMM44 have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome [3]. The treatment and prognosis of these diseases vary depending on the specific mutation and its effects on mitochondrial function. 

## Drug response
No drugs targeting TIMM44 have been approved yet. However, research is ongoing towards identifying drugs that can modulate mitochondrial function in mitochondrial diseases.
