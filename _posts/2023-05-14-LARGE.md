# Information about Gene LARGE

## Genetic Position

LARGE is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q12.3).

## Pathology

Mutations in the LARGE gene have been associated with congenital muscular dystrophy. In particular, mutations in LARGE are a cause of the muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) phenotype, which is characterized by brain abnormalities in addition to muscle weakness and vision changes. Mutations in LARGE are also associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), which is a more severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy.

## Function

The LARGE gene encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that adds repeating units of xylose and glucuronic acid to the dystroglycan protein. This modification, known as O-mannosylation, is necessary for the proper function of dystroglycan in maintaining the integrity of muscle and brain tissue.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are various reported amino acid (AA) mutations in the LARGE gene associated with MEB and WWS, such as missense mutations, splice site mutations, and frameshift mutations. Some examples are:
- p.Arg329Cysfs*105 (fs, dbSNP: rs1064794692)
- p.Cys622Phe (missense, dbSNP: rs137854640)
- p.Ile693Lys (missense, dbSNP: rs137854641)
- p.Glu737Lys (missense, dbSNP: rs137854642)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the LARGE gene.

## Related Disease

Mutations in the LARGE gene have been associated with congenital muscular dystrophy, in particular the muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) phenotypes.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for congenital muscular dystrophy, and treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. The severity and progression of the disease can vary depending on the specific mutation and resulting phenotype.

## Drug Response

There is currently no specific drug or treatment for mutations in the LARGE gene. However, ongoing research is exploring potential therapies that target the O-mannosylation pathway.
