# Genetic Information for gene RPS17

## Overview

The gene RPS17 is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17q21.2. It encodes for ribosomal protein S17, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Ribosomal proteins are essential for the formation of the ribosome and for protein synthesis, and mutations in RPS17 have been associated with various diseases.

## Function

Ribosomal protein S17 is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is involved in mRNA translation. RPS17 helps stabilize the structure of the ribosomal subunit and interacts with other proteins to ensure proper translation initiation and elongation.

## External IDs 

The external IDs for gene RPS17 are:

- HGNC: 10334
- NCBI Entrez: 6205
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108823
- OMIM: 180472
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08708

Aliases for RPS17 include CRLS1, RP17, and S17.

## Mutations

Mutations in RPS17 have been associated with various diseases, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and cancer.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some of the AA mutations in RPS17 associated with DBA include:

- G25D
- S32L
- S33T
- L44P

These mutations are missense mutations, meaning that a single nucleotide change leads to a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. They can be found in the dbSNP database with the following rsIDs:

- rs267606882
- rs267606881
- rs267606880
- rs878853639

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in RPS17 have been identified in various types of cancers. Some examples include:

- rs112444629: a missense mutation in RPS17 found in lung cancer
- rs1057521153: a frameshift deletion in RPS17 found in pancreatic cancer

## Related Disease

Mutations in RPS17 have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare bone marrow failure syndrome that affects the production of red blood cells. DBA can lead to anemia and other complications.

## Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment for DBA typically involves blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and other medications to stimulate the production of red blood cells. In some cases, bone marrow transplants may be necessary. The prognosis for DBA varies, but many patients can lead relatively normal lives with proper treatment.

## Drug Response

There is some evidence to suggest that certain drugs, such as lenalidomide, can be effective for treating DBA in patients with RPS17 mutations. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment options for these patients.
