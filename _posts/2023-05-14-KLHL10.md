## Gene KLHL10

KLHL10 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 8p21. KLHL10 regulates trichloroethylene-induced autoimmunity and inflammation through miR-142, 'Regulation of the N-terminal kinase domain of the A-RAF kinase: small molecule inhibitor development', 'CAMTA1 mutations cause sporadic [â€¦]

### Function

The function of KLHL10 is not yet fully understood. It is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of oxidized proteins, which prevents their aggregation and damage to cells.
