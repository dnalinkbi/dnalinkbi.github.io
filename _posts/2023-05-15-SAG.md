# Gene SAG

**Genetic Position:** SAG is located on Chromosome 2, at position 2q37.1.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the SAG gene have been associated with Oguchi disease, which is a rare inherited disorder that affects the retina.

**Function:** The SAG gene encodes for S-antigen, which is a protein that is found in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. S-antigen is involved in the visual cycle, which is the process by which light signals are converted into visual images in the brain.

**External IDs and Aliases:** Gene ID: 6294. Other aliases include: ARSG, NAG, NRLS1, PNR, RGS1, SAG1, hRGS-rs1.

**External Sites:**
- HGNC: 10534
- NCBI Entrez: 6294
- Ensembl: ENSG00000165322
- OMIM: 181031
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P10586

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** 
- c.457A>G(p.Asp153Gly), rs61751245
- c.873G>A(p.Arg291Gln)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related Disease:** Oguchi disease.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for Oguchi disease. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms, which can include night blindness and vision loss. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

**Drug Response:** There are no drugs specifically targeted at treating Oguchi disease.
