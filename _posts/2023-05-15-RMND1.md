# Gene: RMND1

## Information
RMND1 encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial protein import and tumorigenesis.

## Function
RMND1 is involved in mitochondrial protein import, specifically of the TIM23 complex. It is also implicated in the development of certain cancers.

- NCBI Entrez: 136647
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171188
- OMIM: 614238
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9P032

The gene is located on chromosome 15 at the position 15q23.

Aliases for the gene include:
- SHREC
- SHREC2
- CGI-58
