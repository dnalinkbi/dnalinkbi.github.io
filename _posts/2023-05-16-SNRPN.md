## Gene: SNRPN
The SNRPN gene is located on chromosome 15q11-q13 and encodes a protein known as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein associated polypeptide N (SNRPN). This gene is imprinted, meaning only one copy of the gene is active, and the other copy is silenced. The active copy is dependent on the parent of origin. 

### Function
The protein produced by the SNRPN gene is involved in RNA splicing and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. These functions are important for the regulation of gene expression and normal development.

### Related Disease
The SNRPN gene is associated with several genetic syndromes. Maternal deletions within the 15q11-q13 region can lead to Prader-Willi syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, intellectual disability, and hypogonadism. Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) in this region results in Angelman syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delays, seizures, and behavioral disorders.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome, so treatment is focused on managing symptoms. Early intervention with behavioral and educational therapies can be helpful for individuals with these conditions. 

### Drug Response
There is no known drug response specific to SNRPN mutations or related diseases.
