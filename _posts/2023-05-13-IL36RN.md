## Gene: IL36RN

### Genetic Position
The IL36RN gene is located on chromosome 2 at the position q14.2.

### Pathology and Function
The IL36RN gene encodes the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra) which is a key regulator of immune response and inflammation. Mutations in the IL36RN gene have been associated with several inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, and generalized pustular psoriasis.
