## Information about gene TRDN

### Genetic position
The TRDN gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6, specifically at 6q22.31.

### Pathology
Mutations in the TRDN gene have been associated with several pathological conditions, including central core disease, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, and other muscular disorders.

### Function for gene
The TRDN gene encodes for triadin, a protein found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Triadin plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling in muscle.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the TRDN gene listed in the dbSNP database.

### Related disease
TRDN mutations have been associated with several muscular disorders, including central core disease, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, and recessive catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment options for TRDN-related disorders vary depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms. Some options may include medications to manage symptoms and/or surgery to correct anatomical abnormalities. Prognosis also varies depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms.

### Drug response
There is currently no information available on drug response specifically related to TRDN mutations.
