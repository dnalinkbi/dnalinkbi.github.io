# Gene: RAB23

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 6
- Start position: 25855663 bp
- End position: 25875178 bp

## Pathology 
RAB23 gene mutations have been identified in several diseases including Carpenter syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, and hypothalamic hamartoma. These diseases are collectively known as "RAB23-related disorders".

## Function
The RAB23 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein is known to regulate the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for RAB23-related disorders, but treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs approved specifically for RAB23-related disorders.
