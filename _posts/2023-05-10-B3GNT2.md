## Gene: B3GNT2

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1q24.1

### Pathology:
Studies suggest that mutations in the B3GNT2 gene are associated with poor prognosis in some cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer. 

### Function:
The B3GNT2 gene encodes for a beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, an enzyme that adds sugars to proteins and lipids. This modification is involved in various cellular processes including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses.
