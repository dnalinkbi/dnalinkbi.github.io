## Gene Information

The gene TGIF1 (Transforming Growth Factor Beta Induced Factor 1) is located on the long arm of chromosome X (Xq22.1). It is a protein-coding gene that plays a key role in embryonic development and differentiation by regulating the activity of several signaling pathways. 

## Function

TGIF1 is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with a variety of DNA-binding proteins, including SMADs and CREB. It represses the expression of target genes by recruiting co-repressor complexes that modify chromatin structure and inhibit transcription initiation. This gene has been associated with several developmental disorders, including holoprosencephaly and Keutel syndrome.
