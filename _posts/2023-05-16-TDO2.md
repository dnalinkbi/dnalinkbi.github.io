# Information about Gene TDO2

## Genetic Position
The gene TDO2 (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) is located on chromosome 4q32.1.

## Pathology
TDO2 has been associated with various diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and mental disorders. It has been reported that increased TDO2 expression is involved in tumor immune evasion and that targeting TDO2 may lead to cancer therapy strategies.

## Function
TDO2 encodes tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which is a key enzyme in the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway is the main route of tryptophan metabolism in humans. TDO2 plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of tryptophan and kynurenine, which have important functions in immune responses, neurotransmission, and other physiological processes.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- No known disease-related amino acid mutations are reported in TDO2.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported in TDO2.

## Related Disease
- Mental disorders (e.g., depression and schizophrenia)
- Inflammatory diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis)
- Cancer (e.g., melanoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Targeting TDO2 has been proposed as a potential cancer therapy strategy. However, further research is needed to develop effective TDO2 inhibitors.
- No specific treatment or prognosis information is available for mental disorders and inflammatory diseases associated with TDO2.

## Drug Response
- Several TDO2 inhibitors have been developed and tested in preclinical studies, including indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors and 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT). However, no TDO2 inhibitor has been approved for clinical use yet.
- Some studies have suggested that TDO2 inhibition may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.
