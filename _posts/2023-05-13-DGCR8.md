# Gene Information for DGCR8

## Genetic Position
The DGCR8 gene is located on the chromosome 22 in the q11.21 region, spanning from base pair 18,797,707 to 18,811,284.

## Pathology and Function
The DGCR8 gene encodes the DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 protein. This protein plays a critical role in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, specifically in the processing of pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA. Mutations in DGCR8 have been linked to certain cancers, including neuroblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.
