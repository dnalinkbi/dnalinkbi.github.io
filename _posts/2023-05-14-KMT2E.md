## Information about gene KMT2E

### Genetic position
- KMT2E is located on chromosome 7 (7q22.1).

### Pathology
- KMT2E has been associated with a few developmental disorders, including a neurodevelopmental disorder with seizures and delayed psychomotor development (PMID: 30827496) and an intellectual disability syndrome (PMID: 29608117). 
- Additionally, KMT2E has been implicated in the development of various cancers. For example, KMT2E mutations have been observed in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 23238732).

### Function
- KMT2E encodes a protein called lysine methyltransferase 2E, which is involved in histone modification. 
- Specifically, it catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to lysine 3 of histone H3 (H3K4), which is associated with gene activation.
