# Information about Gene P2RX5

## Genetic Position
Gene P2RX5 is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.2). 

## Pathology
The mutations in gene P2RX5 have been implicated in various types of cancer including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer. 

## Function
P2RX5 gene encodes a member of the P2X purinoceptor family of ATP-gated ion channels. This receptor is expressed in different tissues, including lymphoid and epithelial tissues, and modulates the proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid cells.
