# Gene Information

## Gene Name and ID

The gene of interest is **NDUFS1**, with the official symbol of *NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 1* and the official HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) ID of HGNC:7642.

## Genomic Location and Aliases

The NDUFS1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33.3), spanning a region of 29.9 kb. Other aliases for NDUFS1 include Complex I-39kD, CI-39kD, and CNDI.

## Function

The NDUFS1 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. This protein is involved in electron transfer from NADH to the respiratory chain, and mutations in this gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can result in a variety of conditions, including Leigh syndrome and Parkinson's disease.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic variations in NDUFS1, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels). Here are a few examples of these variations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs:

- c.20A>T - rs1057515769
- c.169G>A - rs755231077
- c.233C>T - rs1057515797

## Related Disease

Various diseases have been associated with mutations in the NDUFS1 gene, particularly those resulting from mitochondrial complex I deficiencies. Some conditions resulting from NDUFS1 mutations include Leigh syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and optic atrophy, among others.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatments for mitochondrial complex I deficiencies can include nutrient therapy, enzyme replacement therapy, and gene therapy, although there is currently no cure for these disorders. The prognosis for individuals with mitochondrial complex I deficiencies varies depending on the severity of the condition and the specific mutations involved.

## Drug Response

There is currently no approved drug or treatment that specifically targets the NDUFS1 gene or the complex I deficiency associated with its mutations. However, various therapies and interventions may help manage symptoms of associated conditions.
