## Gene: B3GNT4

### Summary:
B3GNT4 (Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 4) is a gene that encodes for an enzyme involved in the synthesis of complex N-linked glycan structures. It is located on chromosome 16q23.1.

### Function:
B3GNT4 encodes for an enzyme that adds sugars to glycoproteins, which play important roles in cell signaling and communication. Specifically, B3GNT4 adds a specific type of sugar (N-acetylgalactosamine) to the glycan structures. The function of these glycan structures involves immunomodulation, cell-cell adhesion, and tumor metastasis.
