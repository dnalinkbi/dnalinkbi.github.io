# Information about Gene XIST 

## Gene Function
X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a long non-coding RNA gene that is involved in gene silencing and plays a crucial role in X chromosome inactivation. XIST gene expression leads to the condensation of the inactive X chromosome into a Barr body, thereby inactivating one of the two X chromosomes in female cells.  

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- Gene ID: 7503 
- Genomic location: Xq13.2 
- Aliases: X inactive specific transcript

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are no reported amino acid mutations associated with XIST.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs or InDels associated with XIST. 

## Related Disease
An abnormality in the XIST gene can lead to several diseases like Turner Syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Down Syndrome.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for diseases associated with XIST gene abnormalities. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms associated with the condition.

## Drug Response
There is no experimental evidence relating to drug response in patients with XIST gene abnormalities.
