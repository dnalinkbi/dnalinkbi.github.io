# Information about Gene CAMTA1

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

CAMTA1 is a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q22). It encodes for calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1, which is a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to calcium signals. 

Mutations in the CAMTA1 gene have been linked to several pathologies, including non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial stromal tumors.  

## Function for Gene 

CAMTA1 plays a role in the regulation of several cellular processes, including neuronal development, cardiac hypertrophy, and gene expression in response to calcium signals. It acts as a transcriptional regulator, binding to DNA and activating or repressing gene expression in a calcium-dependent mechanism.
