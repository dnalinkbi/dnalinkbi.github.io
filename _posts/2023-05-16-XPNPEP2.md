## Gene XPNPEP2 Information

### Genetic Position
Gene XPNPEP2 is located on chromosome 18 at the position 18q21.33.

### Pathology
Mutations in the XPNPEP2 gene have been associated with susceptibility to hypertension and kidney disease.

### Function
The XPNPEP2 gene encodes for a protein called X-prolyl aminopeptidase 2. This protein plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure by breaking down peptides that affect blood vessel constriction.
