# Gene FBP1

## Genetic Position

The FBP1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q22.2).

## Pathology

Mutations in the FBP1 gene have been associated with decreased activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis. This can result in a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency, which is characterized by episodes of hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and an enlarged liver.

## Function

The FBP1 gene encodes for the FBPase enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, a critical step in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.

## Related Disease

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency involves maintaining a strict diet with regular meals and avoiding prolonged fasting. Patients may also require glucose infusion during periods of illness or stress.

The prognosis for individuals with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency is variable and dependent on the severity of the underlying mutation and the individual's ability to adhere to a strict diet.

## Drug Response

No specific drug response information is available for individuals with mutations in the FBP1 gene.
