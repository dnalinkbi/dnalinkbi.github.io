# Gene: OPCML

## Genetic Position
OPCML gene is located on Chromosome 11: 111,041,064-111,083,626.

## Pathology and Function
The OPCML gene encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and tumor suppression. It is mainly expressed in the brain and other neural tissues. Mutations in the OPCML gene have been associated with various types of cancers, including ovarian, breast, and colorectal cancers.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for OPCML mutations. The treatment options for cancers associated with OPCML mutations are the same as for other types of cancers. Prognosis may vary depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug Response
Currently, there is no evidence of drug response specifically for OPCML mutations. The drug response for cancers associated with OPCML mutations is the same as for other types of cancers.
