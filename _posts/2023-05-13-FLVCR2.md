# Information about gene FLVCR2

## Genetic Position
FLVCR2 gene maps to the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 at position 24.1.

## Pathology and Function
FLVCR2 encodes a protein called feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor-related protein 2. This protein is involved in the transport of heme, which is a component of hemoglobin, from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. FLVCR2 plays a critical role in the maintenance of intracellular heme homeostasis, and its dysfunction can lead to the accumulation of heme and heme-related compounds, which are toxic for the cell.

## Related Disease
Mutations in FLVCR2 have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis type 4B (ARCI4B) 
- Griscelli syndrome type 3
- Mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia type 2 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for FLVCR2 related diseases may include symptomatic treatment of skin abnormalities and management of anemia. The prognosis depends on the severity of the clinical symptoms, however, in severe cases, it can be fatal.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of FLVCR2-related diseases. Approaches currently being investigated include gene therapy and pharmacological chaperones.
