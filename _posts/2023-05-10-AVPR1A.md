# Gene: AVPR1A

**Function:** The AVPR1A gene encodes the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds the hormone arginine vasopressin.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 899
- NCBI Entrez: 553
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100030
- OMIM: 600821
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P37288
- Genomic location: 12q14.2

**Aliases:** V1aR, AVPR1, V1a receptor

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are various reported AA mutations in AVPR1A gene, summarized as follows:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| R327L | Missense | rs1042615 |
| T223M | Missense | rs17122736 |
| T223N | Missense | rs200536509 |
| F237S | Missense | rs1042616 |
| S316N | Missense | rs200236267 |
| T356M | Missense | rs28345068 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There is no reported somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in AVPR1A gene.

**Related Disease:**

The AVPR1A gene has been associated with various complex traits and neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, depression, social behavior, and pair bonding.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

There is no cure for ASD or many of the neuropsychiatric disorders associated with AVPR1A variations. Treatment generally involves therapies that address specific symptoms. Prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of the disorder and the individual patient.

**Drug Response:**

AVPR1A antagonists and agonists have been developed and tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials for the treatment of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Preliminary results look promising, although more trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these drugs.
