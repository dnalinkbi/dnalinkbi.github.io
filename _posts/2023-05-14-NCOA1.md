# Information on Gene NCOA1

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
- Gene Name: NCOA1 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1)
- Chromosome: 2
- Location: 2p24.1
- Pathology: NCOA1 has been implicated in several types of cancer, including prostate, breast, ovarian, and lung cancers.
- Function: NCOA1 encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional coactivator for several nuclear hormone receptors, including estrogen receptor alpha, thyroid hormone receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. It plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- There are several known mutations in the NCOA1 gene that have been associated with different cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung cancers.
- Mutation types include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations.
- Examples of missense mutations and their dbSNP IDs:
    - p.Asp926Glu (rs121912578)
    - p.Arg628Gln (rs281357)
    - p.Thr650Ile (rs34329066)
- It is worth noting that many of these mutations are rare and have not been thoroughly characterized.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic variations in the NCOA1 gene that have been reported in various cancers based on the COSMIC database.
- Examples of somatic SNVs/InDels and their dbSNP IDs:
    - c.541C>T (rs587777324)
    - c.1372A>G (rs587777326)
    - c.449G>T (rs587777323)

## Related Disease, Treatment, and Prognosis
- Related Diseases: Breast cancer, Prostate cancer, Ovarian cancer, Lung cancer, Endometrial cancer
- Treatment and Prognosis: The role of NCOA1 in cancer progression and metastasis makes it a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Targeted therapies that inhibit the activity of NCOA1 are currently being developed and tested in clinical trials.
- Drug response: Several drugs, including anti-hormonal therapies, have been developed that target the function of NCOA1 in hormone-dependent cancers. However, further research is needed to improve their efficacy and reduce their side effects.
