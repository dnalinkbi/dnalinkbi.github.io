# Information about Gene MTOR

**Genetic Position:** 
MTOR is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p36.22.

**Pathology:**
MTOR gene mutations have been associated with various types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Additionally, mutations in MTOR have been linked to a number of genetic disorders, such as autism, focal cortical dysplasia type II, and Smith-Kingsmore syndrome.

**Function for Gene:**
The MTOR gene encodes for the protein mTOR, which is a kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It is responsible for integrating various signals from the cellular environment, such as growth factors, nutrients, and stress, to coordinate cellular processes.

- Somatic mutations

**Related Diseases:**
- Cancer (e.g., breast, ovarian, lung cancer)
- Genetic Disorders (e.g., autism, focal cortical dysplasia type II, Smith-Kingsmore Syndrome)

**Treatment and Prognosis:**
MTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and everolimus, have been developed to treat certain types of cancer and genetic disorders associated with MTOR mutations. The prognosis and treatment options for patients vary depending on the specific disease and mutation.

**Drug Response:**
Several studies have reported promising results with the use of MTOR inhibitors in cancer treatment. However, drug response may depend on several factors, including the specific MTOR mutation and the stage of cancer.
