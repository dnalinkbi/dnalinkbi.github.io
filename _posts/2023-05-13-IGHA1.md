## Information about Gene IGHA1

### Gene Position and Pathology

- Gene Name: IGHA1
- Chromosome: 14
- Location: 14q32.33
- Pathology: IGHA1 gene is associated with multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects white blood cells called plasma cells.

### Gene Function

IGHA1 gene encodes the alpha-1 chain of the IgA immunoglobulin, which is a glycoprotein mainly found in the mucosal tissues and plays a key role in the immune system by defending against pathogens.
