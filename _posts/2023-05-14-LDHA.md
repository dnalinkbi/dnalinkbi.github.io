# Information about gene LDHA

## Genetic Position
LDHA (Lactate Dehydrogenase A) is located on the q arm of chromosome 11 at position 15.1 (11q15.1).

## Pathology
LDHA is associated with various diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, muscular dystrophy, and retinal degeneration.

## Function
LDHA is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. It is essential for cellular metabolism, energy production, and maintenance of redox balance.
