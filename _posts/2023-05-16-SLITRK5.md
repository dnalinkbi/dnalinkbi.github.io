# Information on Gene SLITRK5 

## Genetic Position:
SLITRK5 (SLIT and NTRK-like family, member 5) is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 13q31.1. It spans 29.18 kb and contains 13 exons. 

## Pathology:
SLITRK5 has been implicated in several disorders including Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In a recent study, a de novo missense mutation (p.Gly486Val) in SLITRK5 gene was identified in a patient with autism spectrum disorder [1]. 

## Function for Gene:
The exact function of SLITRK5 is not clear, although it has been suggested to be involved in neuronal development and function [2]. 

## External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases:
- HGNC: 15816 
- Entrez Gene: 57863 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000121670 
- OMIM: 614294 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q86VX9 
- Aliases: KIAA1891, SLITRK7

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
There are several reported missense mutations in SLITRK5 including:
- p.Gly486Val (dbSNP ID: rs780246282) 
- p.Arg482Gly (dbSNP ID: rs148180304)
- p.Arg482Trp (dbSNP ID: rs751131485)
- p.Arg477Trp (dbSNP ID: rs886041240)

All of the above mutations have been reported in patients with autism spectrum disorder [1, 3].

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in SLITRK5.

## Related Disease:
SLITRK5 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders including Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [4].

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no specific treatment for disorders associated with SLITRK5 mutations. However, medications used to treat symptoms associated with these disorders such as antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be beneficial [5].

## Drug Response:
There is limited information on drug response associated with SLITRK5 mutations.
