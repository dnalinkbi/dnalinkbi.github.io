# Genetic Information on Gene NEK1

## Gene NEK1
NEK1 (NIMA-related kinase 1) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is encoded by the NEK1 gene. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q32.1).

### Function
NEK1 plays a role in DNA damage response and repair pathways, as well as in centrosome duplication and cilia formation.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7762
- NCBI Entrez: 4750
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138622
- OMIM: 604588
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96PY6

Aliases: KIAA1901, NERCC, NLK1, SDK1

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
NEK1 has been associated with sporadic ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and familial ALS. 
Several variations have been identified, including:
- K259R (rs61753333)
- E23K (rs141244591)
- P924S (rs146440855)
- G217E (rs750931175)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations have been identified in various cancer types, including:
- Breast cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Lung cancer

Some examples of somatic mutations are:
- A1012S (rs137853418)
- E19E (rs782126351)
- K249M (rs119459302)

### Related Diseases
Variations in the NEK1 gene have been associated with the following diseases:
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
- Breast Cancer
- Prostate Cancer
- Lung Cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for ALS, but treatment can help ease symptoms and maintain quality of life. The prognosis is generally poor, with a life expectancy of 2-5 years.

The treatment and prognosis for various types of cancer depends on the stage and severity of the disease.

### Drug Response
Further research is needed to determine the drug response of NEK1 mutations.
