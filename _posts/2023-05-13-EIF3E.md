# Gene EIF3E

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 2
- Genomic location: 2q36.1

## Pathology
EIF3E gene mutations have been associated with various types of cancer including lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer.

## Function for gene
The EIF3E gene encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which plays a key role in the initiation of protein synthesis.
