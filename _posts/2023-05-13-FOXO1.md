# Gene: FOXO1

#### Function:
The FOXO1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

#### External IDs:
- Gene ID: 2308
- Genomic location: Chromosome 13q14.1
- Aliases: FKHR, FOXO1A, FORKS, AFX1

#### Related Disease:
- Prostate cancer
- Breast cancer
- Non-small cell lung cancer

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is ongoing research on the potential of using FOXO1 as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. However, further studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of such treatments.

#### Drug Response:
Studies have shown that inhibitors of AKT, a downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway, may have therapeutic potential for cancer treatment by targeting FOXO1.
