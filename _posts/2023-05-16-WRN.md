# Information about Gene WRN

## Genetic position
The WRN gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 8 at position 12.3 (8p12.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in WRN have been associated with Werner syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging, genomic instability, and an increased risk of cancer.

## Function
The WRN gene encodes a protein called Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN), which is involved in DNA repair, genome stability, and telomere maintenance.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some somatic mutations in WRN that have been identified are:
- S114F: Missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs786200950)
- A834fs: Frameshift mutation (dbSNP ID: rs765000337)
- T490R: Missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs367543313)

## Related Diseases
Mutations in WRN have been associated with Werner syndrome, which is characterized by premature aging, genomic instability, and an increased risk of cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Werner syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications, such as osteoporosis and cancer.

## Drug Response
There is limited information about drug response in patients with Werner syndrome.
