# Information about gene TMEM216

## Genetic position
- Gene: **TMEM216**
- Chromosome: 11
- Location: 11q13.1
- Strand: Plus

## Pathology
- TMEM216 gene mutations have been associated with various ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome and Meckel syndrome.

## Function
- The TMEM216 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is a component of the transition zone of the ciliary membrane. The transition zone regulates the entry and exit of proteins from the cilium, a organelle involved in sensory perception and cellular signaling.
