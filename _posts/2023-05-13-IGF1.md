## Gene Information

The **IGF1** gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor 1, which is a polypeptide hormone that plays a crucial role in mammalian growth and development. It is located on chromosome 12q23.2.

## Function

IGF1 regulates cell growth and differentiation, particularly during fetal development and puberty. It also plays a role in tissue repair and regeneration.
