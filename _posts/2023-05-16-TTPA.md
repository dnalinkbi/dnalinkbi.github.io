## Gene TTPA
### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

The TTPA gene is located on chromosome 8 (8q12.3) and encodes for the protein alpha-tocopherol transfer protein. This protein plays a crucial role in transporting alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) from the liver to other tissues of the body. 

Mutations in the TTPA gene have been linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder called ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). AVED is characterized by a progressive neurological disorder that typically presents in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms can include ataxia, muscle weakness, and vision problems. 

### Function
The TTPA gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP). This protein is responsible for the transport of Vitamin E in the bloodstream. It binds to Vitamin E and carries it to other organs, where it helps protect cells from oxidative damage.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in the TTPA gene have not been reported.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the TTPA gene are linked to Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency (AVED), a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by a deficiency of Vitamin E. The deficiency is due to impaired absorption and transport of Vitamin E in the body.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for AVED typically involves high doses of Vitamin E supplementation. However, treatment may not reverse symptoms that have already appeared. Prognosis varies from person to person, but some individuals with AVED may require the use of a wheelchair or become bedridden.

### Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically approved by the FDA for treating individuals with AVED. Vitamin E supplementation is the current standard of care.
