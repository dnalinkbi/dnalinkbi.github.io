# Gene FA2H

## Genetic Position
FA2H is located on chromosome 16q21 in humans, spanning approximately 3.4kb.

## Pathology
Mutations in FA2H have been associated with several neurological disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) type 35 and a rare form of leukodystrophy known as leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy (LWDNM).

## Function
FA2H encodes for fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of 2-hydroxysphingolipids, which are important structural components of myelin in the central nervous system.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Not applicable.

## Related Disease
- Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) type 35
- Leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy (LWDNM)

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no known cure for HSP or LWDNM and treatment options are limited to symptom management. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response for FA2H-related disorders.
