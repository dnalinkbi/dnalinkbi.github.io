# Gene TPMT

- **Function:** 
The gene TPMT (Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase) provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps in the breakdown and removal of toxic substances including certain medications from the body. The enzyme produced by TPMT is primarily involved in the breakdown of thiopurine drugs which are used to treat conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

The TPMT gene has multiple variants that can affect its function. Some of the commonly observed variants along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID are listed below:

| TPMT variant | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| TPMT*2 | SNP | rs1800460 |
| TPMT*3A | SNP | rs1142345 |
| TPMT*3B | SNP | rs1800462 |
| TPMT*3C | SNP | rs1142346 |
| TPMT*4 | SNP | rs1801265 |
| TPMT*5 | SNP | rs28903068 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
  
  There are several somatic variants associated with TPMT gene, some of which are listed below:
  
  | Variant | Type | dbSNP ID | Associated disease |
  | ------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------- |
  | c.132+3A>G | SNV | rs1142347 | Thiopurine-induced myelosuppression |
  | c.400C>T | SNV | rs1142348 | Thiopurine-induced myelosuppression |
  | c.460G>A | SNV | rs11568691 | Mercaptopurine sensitivity |

- **Related disease:**

Variants in the TPMT gene have been associated with the risk of developing toxicity in individuals taking thiopurine drugs. TPMT deficiency can lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites of thiopurine drugs, leading to bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity and increased risk of infections. 

- **Treatment and prognosis:**

Individuals with TPMT deficiency who require thiopurine medications are usually treated with reduced doses or alternate medications to avoid toxicity. Early identification of TPMT variants can help prevent adverse drug reactions. Prognosis usually depends on the severity of toxicity and underlying disease. 

- **Drug response:**

Individuals carrying TPMT variants usually require reduced doses of thiopurine drugs to avoid toxicity. In some cases, alternate medications may need to be used. Thiopurine drugs are primarily prescribed for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory bowel disorders, and individuals carrying TPMT variants may respond differently to treatment.
