## Gene Information for NDUFA1
- **Function:** NDUFA1 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 1) is a nuclear-encoded protein component of the enzyme complex NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene: HGNC:7742
    - Genomic Location: Chr2:69,910,151-69,940,670
    - Alias: C2orf56, B13, CI-18, NDUFV1L, NDUFS1, NDUFS1L, SDAP, VPE1

## Mutation Information
- **AA Mutation List:** There are several mutations in the NDUFA1 gene that have been reported. Some of them with dbSNP IDs are:
    - c.343G>A (p.Ala115Thr), rs121908969
    - c.422A>G (p.Asp141Gly), rs121908970
    - c.527A>G (p.Asn176Ser), rs121908971
    - c.680T>C (p.Leu227Pro), rs201869823
- **Mutation Type:** These mutations are Missense Mutations.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** There are several somatic variants of NDUFA1 gene that have been reported, some of them with dbSNP IDs are:
    - c.337C>G (p.Thr113Ser), rs560218846
    - c.334G>A (p.Ala112Thr), rs7624150
- **Related Disease:** Mutations in the NDUFA1 gene have been associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency. This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a lack of complex I activity, which can lead to a wide range of symptoms affecting many different organs and systems in the body, including the brain, muscles, kidneys, and heart. 
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for mitochondrial complex I deficiency, and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. In severe cases, liver or heart transplant may be considered.
- **Drug Response:** There is limited information available on drug response for NDUFA1 gene mutations.
