## Information on Gene HPS4

### Genetic Position
- HPS4 gene is located on chromosome 22 at the position 22q12.1.

### Pathology
- Mutations in the HPS4 gene can cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 4 (HPS4), which is a rare genetic disorder.
- Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 4 (HPS4) is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency and often pulmonary fibrosis.

### Function for Gene
- The HPS4 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in intracellular trafficking and lysosomal biogenesis.

### Related Disease
- Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome Type 4 (HPS4) is the only disease associated with mutations in the HPS4 gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome Type 4 (HPS4).
- Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
- The prognosis for affected individuals varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response
