# Gene RIMS1

## Information
- **Genetic Position:** 6q12.1 
- **Pathology:** RIMS1 is associated with a variety of neurological disorders. 
- **Function:** RIMS1 encodes for a protein called Regulating Synaptic Membrane Exocytosis 1 (RIM1), which plays a key role in neurotransmitter release by controlling the docking and priming of synaptic vesicles. RIM1 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and is important for memory and learning.
- **Aliases:** RAB3IP, KIAA0851
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 10009
    - NCBI Entrez: 22999
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000124491
    - OMIM: 606629
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NZZ6

## Mutations
- **AA Mutation List:** Several mutations have been identified in the RIMS1 gene, including missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations.
- **Mutation Type:** Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)
- **dbSNP ID:** rs767357564, rs146487848, rs137854920, rs190452106

## Related Disease
- RIMS1 is associated with:
    - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 37 (SCA37)
    - Epilepsy
    - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
    - Schizophrenia
    - Bipolar Disorder
    - Alzheimer's Disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for the neurological disorders associated with RIMS1 mutations. Treatment options include medications to manage symptoms and therapies to improve quality of life.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disorder and the age of onset.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response specifically related to RIMS1 mutations.
