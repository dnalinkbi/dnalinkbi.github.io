# Gene AKAP2

## Overview

**Gene:** AKAP2 (A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 2)

**Aliases:** AKAP-KL, hAKAP-KL, AKAP-KL1, AKAP-KL2, AKAP75, AKAP-KL3

**Function:** The AKAP2 gene encodes a family of structurally diverse proteins that functional as scaffolding proteins, anchoring protein kinases and phosphatases to specific subcellular locations. The encoded protein is a member of the AKAP2 family and promotes cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling.
