## Gene NPL Information

### Genetic Position
The NPL (NPL Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region) gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 at position 3q24-26.

### Pathology
Mutations in the NPL gene have been associated with Wilms tumor, a rare type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children.

### Function
The exact function of the NPL gene remains unknown. However, studies suggest that it may play a role in the development of Wilms tumor.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7895
- NCBI Entrez: 1812
- Ensembl: ENSG00000182656

- Aliases: CT150_HUMAN, FLJ20563, NPL, RP11-435O14.1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid (AA) mutations associated with the NPL gene in Wilms tumor patients. These include:
- G12A - rs180177100
- S18N - rs796865416
- R22G - rs778519958
- Y24D - rs786203896

The mutation type for each of these cases is missense.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are also several somatic SNVs/InDels associated with the NPL gene in Wilms tumor patients. These include:
- c.9_13delCTCTG - rs770958623
- c.14_17delGTGA - rs5743291
- c.24_25insA - rs773283774

### Related Disease
Mutations in the NPL gene have been associated with Wilms tumor, a rare type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis vary for Wilms tumor patients based on the extent and progression of the cancer.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response in patients with mutations in the NPL gene.
