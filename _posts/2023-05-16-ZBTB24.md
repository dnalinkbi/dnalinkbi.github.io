# Gene: ZBTB24

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1q21.1
- Genomic coordinates: NC_000001.11:g.143557221_143682364

## Pathology
ZBTB24 has been linked to several diseases, including lung cancer, breast cancer, glioma, melanoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. It has also been associated with certain developmental disorders, such as Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.

## Function
ZBTB24 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is involved in several biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It regulates the expression of specific genes by binding to their regulatory regions in the DNA and recruiting corepressor complexes.
