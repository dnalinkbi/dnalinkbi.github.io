# Gene: RAB3GAP2

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 1: 59,011,020-59,177,984
- **Pathology:** Mutations in RAB3GAP2 have been associated with Warburg Micro syndrome (WMS), an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, ocular abnormalities, and other neurological abnormalities.
- **Function:** RAB3GAP2 encodes for a protein that is involved in the regulation of the activity of RAB3 proteins, which are important for neurotransmitter release.
- **Aliases:** WASHC4, KIAA0203, RAB3GAP2D
