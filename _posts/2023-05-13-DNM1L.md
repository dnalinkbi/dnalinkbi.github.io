# Information about Gene DNM1L

### Genetic Position
The DNM1L gene is located on the human chromosome 12q24.11. It spans a genomic region of 60,799 base pairs.

### Pathology
Mutations in the DNM1L gene have been associated with human disorders such as optic atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A.

### Function
The DNM1L gene encodes a protein called dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), which is involved in mitochondrial fission.
