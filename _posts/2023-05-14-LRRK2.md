## Information about LRRK2 Gene

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** LRRK2 (Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2) is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 at position 12q12.

- **Pathology:** Mutations in LRRK2 are associated with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control.

- **Function:** LRRK2 encodes a protein called dardarin, which is a multidomain protein with kinase and GTPase activity. The protein is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, including cytoskeletal dynamics, vesicle trafficking, and autophagy.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

#### Common AA Mutations

- G2019S: glycine-to-serine change at position 2019, also known as LRRK2-GS or LRRK2 c.6055G>A. This is the most common mutation associated with LRRK2 Parkinson's disease, accounting for about 1-2% of all cases.

- R1441C: arginine-to-cysteine change at position 1441, also known as LRRK2 c.4321C>T. This mutation is also associated with Parkinson's disease and is found in about 5% of familial cases.

- Y1699C: tyrosine-to-cysteine change at position 1699, also known as LRRK2 c.5096A>G. This mutation is less common but has been reported in multiple Parkinson's disease patients.

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are associated with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms. Medications such as levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors can improve motor function. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another treatment option that involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical impulses.

The prognosis for Parkinson's disease varies, but the disease is generally progressive, and symptoms worsen over time. Some people may live with the disease for many years, while others may experience rapid progression.

### Drug Response

LRRK2 inhibitors are being developed as potential treatments for Parkinson's disease. These drugs target the kinase activity of LRRK2 and may help to slow or stop the progression of the disease. However, clinical trials have yielded mixed results, and more research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these drugs.
