# Information about Gene ESPN

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Position**: ESPN is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position Xq12.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the ESPN gene are associated with nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness. These mutations can affect the function of the hair cells in the inner ear, leading to hearing loss.
- **Function**: The ESPN gene provides instructions for making a protein called espin, which is found in the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear. Espin is involved in the maintenance and organization of the actin filaments that make up the stereocilia, which are important for hearing.

## Gene Information

- **Function**: Espin binds to and bundles F-actin in a Ca2+-sensitive manner.

- **Mutation Type**: Nonsense and missense mutations
- **dbSNP ID**: rs80356606 (p.Arg288*), rs80356607 (p.Trp66*), rs80356608 (p.Arg1262His)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**: There are currently no somatic mutations reported for the ESPN gene in the COSMIC database.
- **Related Disease**: Nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no cure for nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness caused by ESPN gene mutations. Treatment options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and educational interventions such as sign language and speech therapy.
- **Drug Response**: There is currently no information available on drug response for this gene.
