# Information about Gene PRRT2

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function
The PRRT2 gene is located on chromosome 16 (16p11.2) and is associated with a variety of neurological and movement disorders. Mutations in this gene can cause paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA), and episodic ataxia. The PRRT2 protein, also known as proline-rich transmembrane protein 2, is involved in neurotransmitter release and calcium signaling in neurons.

## Function for Gene
The PRRT2 gene encodes a protein that plays a role in synaptic transmission and calcium signaling. Specifically, the protein is involved in the release of neurotransmitters from neurons and in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the PRRT2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including:
- Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD)
- Infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA)
- Episodic ataxia

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for PRRT2-related disorders. Treatment options are focused on managing symptoms and may include medications to control seizures or involuntary movements.

## Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response of individuals with PRRT2-related disorders.
