# Gene information for TIMP3

## Gene Function
TIMP3 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 3) gene is a member of the TIMP gene family, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It inhibits MMPs, which are involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix during tissue remodeling, and thereby plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis.

## Genomic Location and External IDs
- Gene: TIMP3
- Chromosome: 22
- Genomic location: 22q12.1
- Alias: K222B, C1S5, Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD)

External IDs for TIMP3 are as follows:

- HGNC: 11873
- NCBI Entrez: 7078
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135972
- OMIM: 188826
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P35625

## Mutation Information
### AA Mutation list, mutation type, and dbSNP ID
- c.572C>T (p.Arg191Cys) - Missense mutation - dbSNP ID: rs148503196
- c.506G>T (p.Cys169Phe) - Missense mutation - dbSNP ID: rs104886003
- c.265A>T (p.Asp89Val) - Missense mutation - dbSNP ID: rs11547618
- c.362A>T (p.Asn121Ile) - Missense mutation - dbSNP ID: rs786205138

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the TIMP3 gene are associated with several diseases, including:

- Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) - An autosomal dominant disease that causes progressive degeneration of the macula and central vision loss.
- Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - A common cause of blindness in elderly people, characterized by the gradual loss of central vision.
- Coronary artery disease (CAD) - A common cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by the buildup of plaques within the coronary arteries.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure available for Sorsby fundus dystrophy. Treatment options for AMD include the use of anti-VEGF drugs, photodynamic therapy, and laser photocoagulation. Lifestyle modifications and medications such as statins are recommended to prevent and treat coronary artery disease.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that mutations in the TIMP3 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing AMD, and that anti-VEGF drugs can be used to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease. Drug response may vary depending on the specific mutation and disease stage.
