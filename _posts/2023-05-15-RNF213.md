# Gene: RNF213

## Genetic Position and Pathology

**RNF213** gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 25.3. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a variety of cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic stroke, moyamoya disease, and intracranial aneurysm. 

## Function

RNF213 encodes a protein called E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which plays a role in angiogenesis and blood vessel formation. The exact function of the protein encoded by RNF213 is not fully understood yet.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels reported for RNF213.

## Related Disease

Several diseases have been associated with mutations in RNF213 including:
- Moyamoya disease (MMD)
- Intracranial major artery stenosis/occlusion
- Intracranial aneurysm
- Coronary artery disease

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no known cure for Moyamoya disease, but early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes. Treatment options include surgical revascularization procedures, medications to decrease the risk of blood clots, and management of blood pressure and other risk factors.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on drug response associated with RNF213 mutations.
