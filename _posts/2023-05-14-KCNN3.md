# Information about gene KCNN3

## Genetic Position 

The gene KCNN3 is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1q21.3.

## Pathology 

The KCNN3 gene has been associated with several pathologies including epilepsy and bipolar disorder.

## Function for gene 

The KCNN3 gene encodes for the protein potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 3 (KCNN3), which is a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. This protein plays a critical role in regulating the excitability of neurons by controlling the potassium ion flux across the cell membrane.
