## Gene Information for SNRK
**Function:** 
SNRK (SNF-related kinase) gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase which plays a crucial role in regulation of energy metabolism, cell growth and cell survival. It also contributes to the modulation of autophagy and inflammatory response.

**Related disease:**
The SNRK gene is associated with various diseases such as:
- Cancer (lung adenocarcinoma)
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Obesity

**Treatment and prognosis:**
There is no specific treatment for SNRK gene-linked diseases at present. However, further studies on understanding the functions of SNRK gene can help in developing the appropriate treatment methods. 

**Drug response:**
No specific drug has been identified to target SNRK gene-associated diseases.
