## Gene Name: NOG

### Genetic position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: q22

### Pathology
- Mutations in NOG gene have been associated with various skeletal disorders such as multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1) and proximal symphalangism (SYM1).

### Function
- The NOG gene encodes for a protein known as noggin, which is a secreted protein that inhibits bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) from binding to their receptors. Noggin plays a crucial role in several developmental processes including neural tube formation, joint formation, and bone growth.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for NOG in dbSNP.

### Related disease
- SYNS1 and SYM1 are both rare genetic disorders caused by mutations in the NOG gene. SYNS1 is characterized by multiple joint fusions in the hands and feet, while SYM1 is characterized by abnormal fusion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands.

### Treatment and prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for SYNS1 or SYM1. Treatment typically involves management of symptoms such as physical therapy and surgery. The prognosis for individuals with these conditions varies depending on the severity of their symptoms.

### Drug response
- There are no drugs specifically targeting NOG. However, drugs that target the BMP signalling pathway may be useful in treating skeletal disorders associated with NOG mutations.
