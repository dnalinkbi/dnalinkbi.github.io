# Gene: JAG2

## Information

- **Function:** The JAG2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is a ligand for the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene: HGNC:6197
    - Genomic location: Chr14:51,348,485-51,374,669
    - Aliases: hJag2, jagged2, AGS, CD339, JAG2_HUMAN

## Related Diseases

- **Disease:** Alagille syndrome
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
- **Description:** Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organs, including the liver, heart, and kidneys. It is caused by mutations in the JAG1 or NOTCH2 genes, which are also involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Some patients with Alagille syndrome have mutations in the JAG2 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment:** Currently, there is no cure for Alagille syndrome. Treatment is symptom-based, and may include medications for itching, bile acid supplements, and surgery for severe liver or heart problems.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis for Alagille syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms. Some patients may live relatively normal lives with careful management of symptoms, while others may experience life-threatening complications.

## Drug Response

There is limited information on drug response specific to mutations in the JAG2 gene.
