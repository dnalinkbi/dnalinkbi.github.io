## Gene: TAS2R45

- **Function:** TAS2R45 is a member of the G protein-coupled taste receptor family. This gene encodes a taste receptor that responds to bitter compounds.

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: 20368
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 259289
    - Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000181694
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9BYR7
    - Alias: T2R45, taste 2 receptor member 45

- **AA Mutation List:**

|AA Position|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|-------|
|N15S|Missense|rs3741845|
|N194S|Missense|rs3741844|

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:**
    - No known somatic mutations have been reported for gene TAS2R45.

- **Related Disease:** 
    - A few studies have suggested that genetic variations in TAS2R45 may be associated with the taste perception of certain bitter compounds in humans, but there are currently no disease associations reported.

- **Treatment and Prognosis:**
    - As TAS2R45 has no known disease associations, there are no specific treatments or prognoses related to this gene.

- **Drug response:**
    - There are no reported drug response associations for TAS2R45.
