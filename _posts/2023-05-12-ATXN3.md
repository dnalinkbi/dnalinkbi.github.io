# Gene information for ATXN3

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function
- Gene: ATXN3
- Genomic Location: 14q32.12
- Pathology: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the ATXN3 gene
- Function: The ATXN3 gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme called ataxin-3. This enzyme plays a role in regulating protein degradation, particularly the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins. 

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 887
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 4287
- Ensembl: ENSG00000197386
- OMIM: 109150
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P54252
- Aliases: AT3, MJD, SCA3
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 14q32.12

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- AA Mutation List: The most common mutation in the ATXN3 gene is the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat. Normal alleles have between 12-44 CAG repeats, while SCA3 patients have 55-86 CAG repeats. This expansion leads to the production of an abnormally long and misfolded ataxin-3 protein.
- Mutation Type: Expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat
- dbSNP ID: rs12895354, rs12895355, rs12895356, rs12895357, rs12895358, rs57380433, rs193922606, rs193922607

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the ATXN3 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)
- Parkinson's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for SCA3/MJD. Treatment is generally supportive and aims to manage symptoms. The prognosis for SCA3 is highly variable and depends on the severity of symptoms. 

## Drug Response
Several drugs have been investigated for the treatment of SCA3/MJD, including lithium, valproic acid, and minocycline. However, there is currently no effective disease-modifying therapy for SCA3/MJD.
