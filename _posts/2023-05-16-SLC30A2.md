# Summary of Gene SLC30A2

## Genetic Position
- Gene: SLC30A2
- Chromosome: 1
- Locus: q32.1
- Genomic Position: 203,169,181 - 203,182,526

## Pathology and Function
- SLC30A2 encodes a zinc transporter protein that plays a crucial role in zinc homeostasis within cells. Zinc is essential for a wide range of cellular processes, including gene expression, metabolism, and immune function. Disruptions to zinc homeostasis can lead to a variety of diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancers.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- None reported yet.

## Related Disease
- Acrodermatitis enteropathica
- Prostate cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica involves lifelong zinc supplementation, as patients with this condition cannot absorb zinc efficiently from their diet. With proper treatment, the prognosis for acrodermatitis enteropathica is good, and patients can lead normal lives.
- Treatment for prostate cancer may involve surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy. The prognosis for prostate cancer varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no information available about drug response related to SLC30A2.
