# Information about gene SEP15

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p31.1

## Pathology
The mutation in the SEP15 gene is associated with various diseases including liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Function
The SEP15 gene encodes for selenoprotein P (SEPP1), which is responsible for transporting selenium in the body. SEPP1 is also involved in redox regulation and oxidative stress response.
