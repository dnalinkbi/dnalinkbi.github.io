# Information about gene FGF9

## Genetic position

FGF9 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 9) is a gene located on chromosome 13q12.11.

## Pathology

Variations in the FGF9 gene have been associated with various conditions, including skeletal dysplasia and cancer. Mutations in this gene have been linked to acropectoral syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by limb malformations.

## Function

FGF9 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of signaling proteins. It plays an important role in embryonic development and cell differentiation. FGF9 is involved in the regulation of bone growth and formation.

## External IDs and aliases

- HGNC ID: 3690
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 2254
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000068847
- OMIM ID: 600921
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P31371

Aliases: FGF-9, HBGF-9, MGC119980

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

Some known mutations in the FGF9 gene include:

- R103H (dbSNP ID: rs121735348)
- G152E (dbSNP ID: rs121918278)
- R203K (dbSNP ID: rs200645299)

These mutations are missense mutations, which means that they result in a change in a single amino acid in the FGF9 protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Some somatic variations in the FGF9 gene include:

- rs148865233
- rs191241181
- rs749296074

## Related diseases

Variations in the FGF9 gene have been associated with several conditions, including:

- Acropectoral syndrome
- Multiple synostosis syndrome
- Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for conditions related to the FGF9 gene vary depending on the specific condition and severity of the symptoms. In some cases, treatment may involve surgical intervention or medication to manage symptoms.

## Drug response

Currently, there are no drugs that specifically target the FGF9 gene.
