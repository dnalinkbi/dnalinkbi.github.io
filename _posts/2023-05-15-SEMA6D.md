# Gene: SEMA6D

## Genetic Position:
SEMA6D gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.3 (15q21.3).

## Pathology:
SEMA6D has been associated with various pathological conditions including cancer, immune disorders, and neurological diseases.

## Function:
SEMA6D encodes a member of the semaphorin family of proteins. The protein functions as a signaling molecule that guides the development and function of various cells, including neurons, immune cells, and cancer cells. SEMA6D regulates cell migration, axon guidance, and immune responses.

## External IDs and Aliases:
- HGNC:10894
- NCBI Entrez: 10512
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137968
- OMIM: 610558
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HCT0
- Aliases: SEMAJ, SEMA6DJ, sema domain, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain, (semaphorin) 6D, Semaphorin K6D

## AA Mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
There are few reported variations in the SEMA6D gene associated with diseases. One of them is as follows:

- Missense mutation: c.1549T>G | p.Leu517Arg | rs147095700

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
Few somatic mutations are reported in the SEMA6D gene which are related to different types of cancer. One of them is as follows:

- Missense mutation: c.1570G>A | p.Arg524Gln | rs13429108

## Related Disease:
Mutations in the SEMA6D gene have been associated with different pathologies including:

- Cancer
- Immune disorders
- Neurological diseases

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no specific treatment available yet for SEMA6D-related diseases. However, various studies suggest that targeting SEMA6D could be a promising approach for the treatment of different types of cancers including lung, breast, and pancreatic.

## Drug Response:
Few studies suggest that a monoclonal antibody targeting SEMA6D can induce the immune-mediated destruction of cancer cells.
