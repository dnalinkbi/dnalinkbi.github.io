## Gene Information

**Gene symbol:** RPL26

**Gene Name:** Ribosomal protein L26

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 10342 
- NCBI Entrez: 6159 
- Ensembl: ENSG00000134910 
- OMIM: 180456 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P61250 

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 17q11.2-q12

**Aliases:** RPL26P5, L26

## Function for Gene

RPL26 is a ribosomal protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis and functional activity of the ribosome. It is involved in the assembly of the 60S large subunit of the ribosome, which is responsible for translation of mRNA into protein.

## Mutations and related diseases

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type:** No clinically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported for RPL26.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** Somatic mutations in RPL26 have been reported in various types of cancers, including breast, lung, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. These mutations include missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Some of the reported somatic mutations and their dbSNP IDs are:
   - c.416G>A (p.R139H) rs200636750
   - c.121C>T (p.R41*) rs267600341
   - c.164_169del (p.K55fs) rs1064794605
   
- **Related Diseases:** Somatic mutations in RPL26 have been associated with various types of cancers, including lung, breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. However, the exact role of these mutations in the development and progression of cancer is not well understood.

## Treatment and Prognosis

As of now, there is no specific treatment available for RPL26-related diseases. Treatment is usually focused on treating the underlying disease, such as chemotherapy or surgery for cancer. The prognosis for RPL26-related diseases can vary depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug Response

There is limited information available on the drug response of RPL26-related diseases. However, some preclinical studies suggest that targeting RPL26 may enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Further research is needed to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting RPL26 in cancer treatment.
