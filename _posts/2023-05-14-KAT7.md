# Gene Information: KAT7

## Basic Information
- **Gene:** KAT7
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 29475
    - NCBI Entrez: 7994
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000196954

- **Mutation Type:** Missense 
- **dbSNP ID:** rs139607901

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- **dbSNP ID:** rs200462934, rs200947427, rs201707273

## Related Disease
Mutations in the KAT7 gene have been associated with cancer development, including breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no approved treatment for KAT7-associated cancer. However, research continues on developing targeted drugs to inhibit KAT7 and treat KAT7-associated cancer.

## Drug Response
Studies have shown that the sensitivity of cancer cells to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, may increase with decreased KAT7 expression.
