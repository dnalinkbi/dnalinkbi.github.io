# Information about Gene DXO

## Genetic Position

Gene DXO is located on chromosomal location 15q23 and is situated on the positive strand of the DNA.

## Pathology and Function

The DXO gene encodes for a pyrophosphatase enzyme that is responsible for  RNA capping. This enzyme helps to remove the RNA cap structure from an RNA molecule. RNA capping is essential for the stability of the RNA molecule and for the initiation of translation. Defects in the DXO gene result in abnormal RNA processing which is linked to neurodegenerative diseases.
