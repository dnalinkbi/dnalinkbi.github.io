# Info on Gene IGHV3-21

## Genetic Position
The IGHV3-21 gene is located on chromosome 14q32.33 within the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene family.

## Pathology 
The IGHV3-21 gene has been implicated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren’s syndrome. It has also been found to be associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

## Function
IGHV3-21 gene encodes for a variable region of a B cell receptor and plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin diversity and antigen recognition.

| c.361T>C | rs121908809 | Associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma |

## Related Diseases
The IGHV3-21 gene has been associated with various autoimmune diseases, including:
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Sjogren’s syndrome
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
