# Information on gene SLC7A11

### Genetic Position
The gene SLC7A11 is located on chromosome 4q28.2.

### Pathology
SLC7A11 plays a critical role in the regulation of oxidative stress, and studies have shown that it may be involved in various pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

### Function
SLC7A11, also known as cystine/glutamate transporter, is a protein-coding gene that plays a vital role in the transport of cystine, an amino acid, and glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. This gene is involved in the maintenance of intracellular glutathione levels, an antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative damage.
