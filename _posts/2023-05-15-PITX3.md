# Gene PITX3

## Genetic Position
PITX3 gene is located on chromosome 10q25.3. It spans about 58.53 kb of genomic DNA and has nine exons.

## Pathology
Variants in this gene are associated with several ocular disorders such as cataracts and glaucoma.

## Function
PITX3 encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in the development of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and in the differentiation of lens fibers. The transcription factor is also involved in the development of other tissues such as the pituitary gland and teeth.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic variants reported in the PITX3 gene in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Variants in the PITX3 gene are associated with several ocular disorders including:
- Anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD)
- Cataract 11, multiple types
- Glaucoma, normal tension
- Peter's anomaly
- Ring dermoid of cornea

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, treatment options for ocular disorders caused by PITX3 gene variants are limited to surgical interventions such as cataract removal or glaucoma filtration surgery. Prognosis largely depends on the severity and type of ocular disorder.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug response related to the PITX3 gene.
