## Gene Information Analysis: DIS3L2

Gene DIS3L2 is located on chromosome 2 at position 2q37.1. It encodes for a protein called DIS3L2, which belongs to the exonuclease EN domain-containing family. This protein is involved in RNA processing and degradation.

### Function
DIS3L2 is an RNA exonuclease that has been implicated in RNA processing and degradation. It is involved in the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and noncoding RNA (ncRNA), and it may also be involved in the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis.

### Related Disease
DIS3L2 mutations have been linked to Perlman syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder affecting several organs, including the kidneys, liver, and pancreas.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Perlman syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.

### Drug Response
No information reported.
