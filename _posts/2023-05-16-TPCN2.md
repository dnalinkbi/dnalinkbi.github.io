# Gene TPCN2

## Basic Information
- **Function for gene:** TPCN2 (Two Pore Calcium Channel) is involved in the regulation of calcium release from endosomes. It facilitates the transport of lipids and ions that are essential for cell growth, development, and signaling pathways.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - GeneID: 53372
    - HGNC: 30081
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000151231
    - OMIM: 610478
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NEP7
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q21.1
    - Aliases: TPC2, FLJ45874

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.1890C>T (p.Arg630Trp) - rs35769314
    - c.305G>A (p.Arg102His) - rs35317131
    - c.2215C>T (p.Thr739Ile) - rs139289222
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.2003C>T (p.Thr668Ile) - rs766625756
    - c.524G>T (p.Asp175Tyr) - rs755712281
    
## Related Diseases
- **Pathology:** Mutations in TPCN2 have been associated with various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and gastric cancer.
- Mutations in TPCN2 have also been linked to the development of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a rare inherited disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. 
- TPCN2 mutations are also associated with lysosomal storage disorders, including lysosomal acid lipase deficiency and Niemann-Pick disease type C2.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for NPC. However, there are treatments available to manage some of the symptoms. These include medications to alleviate seizures, alleviate sleep disturbances, and surgery to correct vision problems.
- The prognosis for NPC varies depending on the type and severity of the disease. In severe cases, most children with NPC die before reaching the age of 10. In less severe cases, children may survive into adulthood but may experience a progressive decline in their ability to move, speak, and think clearly.
- Further research is needed to develop more effective treatments and improve the prognosis for individuals with TPCN2 mutations.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information about drug responses in individuals with TPCN2 mutations. Current research suggests that certain medications, such as miglustat, may be beneficial in treating NPC by reducing the accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes.
