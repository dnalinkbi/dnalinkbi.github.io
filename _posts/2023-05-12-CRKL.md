## Information about gene CRKL

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 22 (22q11.21)
- **Pathology**: Mutations in CRKL are associated with developmental disorders like DiGeorge syndrome and congenital heart disease.
- **Function**: CRKL encodes an adaptor protein that plays a role in several cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### Gene Details

- **External IDs**: HGNC:2361, NCBI Entrez:1399, Ensembl:ENSG00000177954, OMIM:602007, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:P46109
- **Aliases**: CRK-like protein

### Mutations

- **AA Mutation List**: p.Gly207Val, p.Pro222Ser, p.Tyr179Cys, p.Arg186Gln
- **Mutation Type**: Missense
- **dbSNP IDs**: rs34835774, rs34835774, rs398123034, rs201372511

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

- No known somatic mutations have been reported in CRKL.

### Related Diseases
