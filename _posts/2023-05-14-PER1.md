# Information on Gene PER1

## Genetic Position 
- Chromosome: 17
- Genomic Position: Chr17:68,964,330-68,982,087

## Pathology and Function
- PER1 gene is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm of the body
- Pathology: Disruptions to the normal circadian rhythm have been associated with several health conditions, including sleep disorders, metabolic disorders and certain types of cancer.

## Gene Function 
- Plays a vital role in the mammalian circadian clock 
- It regulates the expression of PER2 and other clock genes 
- It influences the bodyâ€™s biological processes like sleep-wake cycle, metabolism, and cell division.

## External IDs
- GeneID: 5187
- HGNC: 8829
- Ensembl: ENSG00000109046
- OMIM: 602724
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15534
- Aliases: HPF1, RIGUI, PER, hPER

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No pathogenic mutations are reported for the PER1 gene
- Moderate, benign and likely benign mutations are reported in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- A total of 37 SNVs and 3 InDels are reported for the PER1 gene in the COSMIC database
- dbSNP ID: rs17082652, rs34991538, rs201114494

## Related Diseases
- DSPS (Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome)
- FASPS (Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome)
- ASPS (Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment for circadian rhythm disorders involves light therapy, melatonin supplements and sleep hygiene.
- The prognosis is positive with early diagnosis and prompt treatment.

## Drug Response
- Several studies have shown that mutations in the PER1 gene were associated with changes in the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs.
