# Information about gene FOLH1

## Gene Position
- FOLH1 is located on chromosome 11 at position 11q13.4

## Pathology
- FOLH1 is associated with various cancers, including prostate, kidney, lung, and ovarian cancers. It has also been found to play a role in the development of neuropathic pain and glutamate signaling.

## Function
- FOLH1 encodes a protein called folate hydrolase 1, also known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). 
- The protein is mainly expressed in the prostate gland and is involved in the metabolism of folate. PSMA is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the uptake of folate into cells. It also has glutamate carboxypeptidase activity, which plays a role in the regulation of glutamate signaling.

## Related Disease
- FOLH1 is associated with various cancers, including prostate, kidney, lung, and ovarian cancers. It has also been found to play a role in the development of neuropathic pain.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- FOLH1 is a potential target for cancer therapy, and several drugs targeting PSMA are in clinical development. The prognosis for cancer patients with FOLH1 mutations may depend on the specific mutation and the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug Response
- FOLH1 is a target for several drugs in development for cancer treatment, including small molecule inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates.
