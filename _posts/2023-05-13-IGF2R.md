## Gene: IGF2R 

### Function:
IGF2R is a protein-encoding gene that is mainly involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as a receptor for insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), thereby controlling its uptake and degradation. Moreover, it also binds and internalizes mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-modified proteins, which are important for lysosomal enzymes trafficking. 

### External IDs and Genomic Location:
- HGNC: 5457
- NCBI Entrez: 3482
- Ensembl: ENSG00000171862
- OMIM: 147280
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11717

IGF2R is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q26) and spans approximately 282 kb.

### Aliases:
IGF2 receptor, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, M6P/IGF2 receptor.

### Related Disease:
Aberrant IGF2R expression and function have been implicated in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no specific treatment available for IGF2R-related diseases. However, several drugs targeting IGF2 signaling pathways are being developed and tested in clinical trials for cancer therapy.

### Drug Response:
One study showed that the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, decreased IGF2R expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting that this receptor may be a potential therapeutic target for this type of cancer.
