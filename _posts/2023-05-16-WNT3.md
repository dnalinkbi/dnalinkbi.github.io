# Gene WNT3

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 17
- Location: q21.31

## Pathology and Function
- WNT3 gene encodes for a protein that belongs to the wingless-type MMTV integration site family and functions as a signaling molecule in the embryonic development of dorsal-ventral axis formation in vertebrates.
- Pathologically, mutations in this gene can lead to developmental disorders, including tetra-amelia syndrome.

## Related Diseases
- Tetra-amelia syndrome
- Preaxial polydactyly 3

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment includes supportive care and treatment of specific symptoms.
- The prognosis of tetra-amelia syndrome is poor, as the condition is associated with severe developmental abnormalities and is often fatal.

## Drug Response
- No drug response information is available at this time.
