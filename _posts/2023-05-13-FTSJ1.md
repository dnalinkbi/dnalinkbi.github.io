# Information about Gene FTSJ1

## Genetic Position
The FTSJ1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome X (Xq27.1). 

## Pathology 
Mutations in the FTSJ1 gene have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and also with non-syndromic sensorineural deafness.

## Function
The FTSJ1 gene encodes for a protein called FtsJ RNA methyltransferase homolog 1, which is a RNA methyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is involved in post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, specifically in the methylation of RNA molecules at the N6-position of adenosine (m6A), which is important for RNA stability and processing.
