# Information about gene HOMER2

## Genetic Position
The HOMER2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14 at position 14q24.1.

## Pathology
HOMER2 is associated with neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and alcohol dependence. Studies suggest that disruptions in HOMER2 protein may lead to abnormal synaptic plasticity and contribute to the development of these disorders.

## Function
The HOMER2 gene encodes a member of the HOMER family of scaffold proteins that play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. HOMER2 protein promotes the formation of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling complexes and facilitates the localization of ionotropic glutamate receptors to the post-synaptic membrane.

## External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location
- Gene ID: 9453
- NCBI Entrez: "homer2"
- Ensembl: ENSG00000119772
- HGNC: 5008
- OMIM: 604935
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NSC5

Aliases for the gene include HOMER-2, KIAA0643, SIP2-28 and Vesl-2S. 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Several protein-altering SNPs have been identified in the HOMER2 gene, including:
- rs17184090: p.Arg287Ter
- rs140557155: p.Asn329Ser
- rs147520138: p.Ile90Met

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Information regarding somatic mutations in the HOMER2 gene is currently unavailable.

## Related Disease
The HOMER2 gene has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including:
- Schizophrenia
- Alcohol dependence

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for schizophrenia or alcohol dependence. Treatment options typically include psychotherapy, medications, and support groups.

## Drug Response
Studies have identified a potential therapeutic target in the HOMER2 protein for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, research on developing drugs that target this protein is still in the early stages.
