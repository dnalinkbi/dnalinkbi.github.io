# Gene Information for RSPO1

## Gene Position

RSPO1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q41-q42.3).

## Pathology

Mutations in the RSPO1 gene have been associated with various skeletal dysplasias, including autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome and autosomal dominant brachydactyly type B1.

## Function

RSPO1 is a member of the R-spondin family of proteins that act as Wnt agonists. It plays a role in the regulation of Wnt signaling, which is involved in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer.
