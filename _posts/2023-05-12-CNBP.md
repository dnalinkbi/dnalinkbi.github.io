# Gene CNBP

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 3
- Genomic Position: 88,435,976 - 88,489,210

## Pathology
- CNBP (CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein) is associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), a multisystemic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. A CTG expansion in the first intron of CNBP leads to the formation of expanded CUG RNA repeats, which sequester specific RNA-binding proteins and deregulate alternative splicing, leading to the pathogenesis of DM2.

## Function
- CNBP encodes a zinc finger protein that functions as a DNA and RNA binding protein. It regulates transcription, binds single-stranded DNA and RNA, promotes cell proliferation, and plays a role in mRNA processing and splicing.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels were found.

## Related Disease
- Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2)

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no known cure for DM2. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and degree of muscle involvement.

## Drug Response
- The use of some medications, including certain anesthesia and muscle relaxants, should be avoided in individuals with DM2, as they may exacerbate muscle weakness.
