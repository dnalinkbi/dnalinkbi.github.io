# Gene NPHP3

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: 3
- Location: 3q22.1

## Pathology
Mutations in the NPHP3 gene are associated with nephronophthisis, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. Nephronophthisis is characterized by the degeneration of the tubules of the kidney, leading to renal failure. NPHP3 mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to be affected.

## Function
The NPHP3 gene encodes a protein called nephrocystin-3, which is a component of the ciliary transition zone in kidney cells. This transition zone regulates the entry and exit of molecules in and out of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the cell surface that play important roles in cellular signaling and sensing.

None reported

## Related disease
Nephronophthisis

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for nephronophthisis, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preserving kidney function. This can include medications to control blood pressure and anemia, dietary changes, and eventually dialysis or kidney transplantation if renal failure occurs.

## Drug response
None reported
