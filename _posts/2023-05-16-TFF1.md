### Gene TFF1 Information

- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 21: 43,480,728-43,483,163
- **Function for gene:** TFF1 encodes a protein called Trefoil Factor 1, which is involved in mucosal protection, cell migration, and wound healing in the gastrointestinal tract.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
    - HGNC: 11778
    - NCBI Entrez: 7031
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000160294
    - OMIM: 600P352
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04155
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - c.109A>G (p.Thr37Ala) rs1800974
    - c.32C>T (p.Pro11Leu) rs116449247
    - c.10T>C (p.Ile4Thr) rs17853631

    - c.88G>A (p.Arg30His) rs56183045
- **Related disease:** TFF1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer, due to its downregulation and methylation in gastric tumors. It has also been implicated in breast cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker for patient survival.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis for diseases related to TFF1 varies depending on the specific condition and stage of the disease.
- **Drug response:** There is currently no known drug response or targeted therapy specifically for TFF1-related diseases.
