### Gene AQP3

#### Genetic Position: 
AQP3 (Aquaporin 3) gene is located on chromosome 9q13.

#### Pathology:
Mutations in AQP3 gene are associated with several skin disorders, including Skin barrier dysfunction-itch-redness (SBDIR) syndrome, Palmoplantar keratoderma, and Hyperkeratosis, and Ichthyosis.

#### Function:
Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is an aquaglyceroporin protein which is primarily expressed in the skin, kidney, and airways. It facilitates the transport of water and glycerol across cell membranes and plays a vital role in skin hydration and wound healing.

- Ichthyosis
- Skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
- Skin basal cell carcinoma (BCC)

#### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment and prognosis depends on the specific disease associated with AQP3 gene mutations.

#### Drug Response:
There is limited information on the drug response associated with AQP3 gene mutations.
