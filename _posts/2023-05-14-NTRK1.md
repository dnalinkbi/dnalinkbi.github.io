## Gene NTRK1

### Genetic Position
Gene NTRK1 is located on chromosome 1 at the position 1q23.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the NTRK1 gene are associated with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), a rare disorder characterized by the inability to perceive physical pain.

### Function
The NTRK1 gene encodes the TrkA protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the development and survival of neurons that transmit sensory information, including those that transmit pain signals.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Ile699Leu (rs121908782)
- p.Val555Met (rs386833590)
- p.Pro515Ala (rs387907014)
- p.Arg678Trp (rs767236936)

These mutations are missense mutations.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.1955G>A (rs758895708)
- c.631C>G (rs750059243)
- c.1962C>T (rs764463151)

These SNVs/InDels are somatic and their consequences are unknown.

### Related Disease
Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CIP as it is a genetic disorder. Treatment mainly focuses on symptom management, such as preventing injuries and infections that may result from the inability to feel pain.

### Drug Response
There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of CIP.
