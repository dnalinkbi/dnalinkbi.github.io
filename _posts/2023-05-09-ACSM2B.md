## Gene: ACSM2B

**Function**: ACSM2B (Acyl-CoA Synthetase Medium-Chain Family Member 2B) is a protein-coding gene that plays a role in lipid metabolism. It encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the activation of medium-chain fatty acids for β-oxidation.

**External IDs**:
- HGNC: 31602
- NCBI Entrez: 79709
- Ensembl: ENSG00000165211
- OMIM: 614525
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8TDX5

**Aliases**: ACSM2, MGC117323, MGC129773

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
There are multiple variations in the ACSM2B gene on chromosome 16. The Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) available in dbSNP with their respective Mutation type and rsID are given below:
- p.A173S, Missense, rs34536808
- p.S91F, Missense, rs200394582
- p.R149H, Missense, rs188674946
- p.E26*, Nonsense, rs758303078

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
No known somatic mutations have been reported in the literature yet.

**Related Diseases**: Though there are no diseases directly related to the ACSM2B gene, lipid metabolism disorders such as Medium- and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency have been linked to mutations in other medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase genes.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: As there are no diseases directly related to the ACSM2B gene, any treatment and prognosis information is not applicable.

**Drug response**: There are no drugs currently known that directly target the ACSM2B gene.
