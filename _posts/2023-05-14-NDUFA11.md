## Gene: NDUFA11

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Genetic Position:** NDUFA11 is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33.3).
- **Pathology:** Mutations in NDUFA11 are related to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. 

### Function
- **Function:** NDUFA11 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which is responsible for electron transfer during oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. NDUFA11 plays a role in the assembly and stabilization of complex I and is required for its proper function.

### External IDs and Aliases
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 7727, NCBI Entrez Gene: 4691, Ensembl: ENSG00000129317, OMIM: 601016, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43678
- **Aliases:** CI-39k

- c.301G>T (p.Glu101Ter) - rs750078964
- c.351C>T (p.Ala117Val) - rs797046833

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/Indels were found in NDUFA11.

### Related Disease
- **Related Disease:** Mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including developmental delay, muscle weakness, seizures, lactic acidosis, and respiratory failure.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for mitochondrial complex I deficiency are limited and largely supportive. Patients may be treated with vitamin supplements, particularly riboflavin and coenzyme Q10, which can improve energy production in mitochondria. The prognosis for patients with complex I deficiency varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of onset.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response related to NDUFA11 mutations.
