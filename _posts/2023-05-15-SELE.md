# Gene: SELE

**Function:** SELE (Selectin E) is a gene that encodes for a cell adhesion molecule, which is expressed by endothelial cells and mediates leukocyte-endothelial interactions during inflammation.

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

- HGNC: 10779
- NCBI Entrez: 6401
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108781
- OMIM: 131240
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P16581
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1 (1q24.2)

**Aliases:** CD62E, ELAM1

**AA Mutation List:** The following AA mutations have been reported in SELE:

| AA mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| p.Leu554Phe | Missense      | rs730882650 |
| p.Pro7Thr   | Missense      | rs121909157 |
| p.Leu178Pro | Missense      | rs137853616 |
| p.Asp146Gly | Missense      | rs137853615 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels:** The following somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in SELE:

| Variation                     | dbSNP ID |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| SELE p.Lys198Val               | rs879253301 |
| SELE c.257-14_257-12delCTT     | rs750438009 |
| SELE p.Thr119=                 | rs576680696 |

**Related Disease:** Mutations and dysregulation in SELE have been implicated in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, stroke, cancer, and endothelial dysfunction.

**Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for diseases related to SELE mutations are currently under investigation and may vary depending on the specific disease.

**Drug Response:** Research is underway to investigate drug response to mutations and dysregulation in SELE, particularly in the context of cardiovascular disease.
