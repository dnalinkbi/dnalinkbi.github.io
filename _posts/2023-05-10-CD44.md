## Gene CD44

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** The CD44 gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and spans approximately 50 kilobases.
- **Pathology:** The CD44 gene has been implicated in several pathologies, including cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune disorders.
- **Function:** The CD44 gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that is involved in cell adhesion and migration. It also plays a role in lymphocyte activation and trafficking.
- **Aliases:** LHR, MC56, MDU2, MDU3, MIC4, Pgp1, CDW44, CSPG8, HCELL

### Related Disease

CD44 has been associated with various diseases, including:
- Cancer (e.g. breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer)
- Inflammation
- Autoimmune disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis)

### Treatment and Prognosis

The role of CD44 in disease pathogenesis has led to the development of various therapeutic approaches targeting CD44. These include anti-CD44 antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. However, their success in clinical trials has been limited thus far.

### Drug Response

Targeting CD44 with therapeutic agents has been shown to decrease tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical models, although clinical trials have shown limited success. Additional research is needed to better understand the mechanisms involved in response to CD44-targeted therapeutics.
