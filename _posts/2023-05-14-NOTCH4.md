## Gene: NOTCH4

### Information:

- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 6 (6p21.3)

- **Function**: The NOTCH4 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that functions in cell signaling processes. It is a crucial component of the Notch signaling pathway, which controls cell fate and differentiation during development and in adult tissues.

- **External IDs and Aliases**: 
    - HGNC:7576
    - NCBI Entrez:4855
    - Ensembl:ENSG00000170558
    - OMIM:600556
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q99466

- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**:
There are several AA mutations reported in the NCBI ClinVar database that are associated with various diseases: 
    - R696C (#rs148846703)
    - R752C (#rs121918119)
    - R1548H (#rs1553899748)
    - E1576K (#rs1553899751)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: 
There are several somatic mutations reported in the COSMIC database for various cancer types. Some of the examples include: 
    - c.3337T>A (#COSM4547659)
    - c.4609A>T (#COSM14833)

- **Related Diseases**: Some of the diseases associated with NOTCH4 mutations include:
    - Schizophrenia
    - Breast cancer
    - Colorectal cancer

- **Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease associated with NOTCH4 mutations.

- **Drug response**: Currently, there are no specific drugs available for NOTCH4-related diseases. However, there are ongoing clinical trials targeting the Notch signaling pathway in cancer.
