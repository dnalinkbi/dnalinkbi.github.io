## Gene CCR2

- Function: CCR2 gene codes for a protein known as chemokine receptor 2, which is mostly found on the surface of white blood cells called monocytes. It plays a vital role in inflammation and immune response by regulating the activation and migration of immune cells to the site of injury.

- Related disease: The mutations in the CCR2 gene are mostly associated with inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.

- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment and prognosis of the diseases related to CCR2 gene mutations depend on the severity of the disease, and there are no specific treatments available for these mutations.

- Drug response: Several drugs targeting CCR2 receptors are under development, and some of them are already in clinical trials for inflammatory diseases.
