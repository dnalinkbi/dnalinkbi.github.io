# Gene: AKT1

### Genetic Position:
The gene AKT1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at position 32.33.

### Pathology:
AKT1 is a well-known proto-oncogene that encodes for the protein known as AKT1 or protein kinase B (PKB). The activation of this gene often leads to an increase in cancer proliferation, cell growth, and inhibits apoptosis. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer.

### Function:
The AKT1 gene plays a crucial role in various cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, protein synthesis, cell growth, and survival. AKT1 belongs to a family of serine and threonine kinases that are involved in signaling pathways that promote the proliferation and survival of cells. AKT1 is activated by several upstream proteins such as PI3K, PDK1, and mTOR. Upon activation, AKT1 phosphorylates downstream targets that drive cell survival and proliferation.

- c.49G>C (rs121913530)

### Related Disease:
Mutations in AKT1 have been associated with several disorders such as Proteus syndrome, Ovarian Carcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Several drugs are being developed that inhibit the activation of AKT1, which can prevent tumor growth in cancer patients. Patients with AKT1 mutations may have a poor prognosis, but outcomes depend on disease stage and other factors.

### Drug Response:
AKT1 inhibitors show promise as a targeted therapy for several types of cancer such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer.
