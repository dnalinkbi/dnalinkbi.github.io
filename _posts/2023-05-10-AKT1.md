## Gene: AKT1 
AKT1 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 14q32.33. The gene is involved in several cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. 

### Function: 
 AKT1 belongs to the AKT family of serine/threonine protein kinases. It acts as a key regulator of signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and survival. AKT1 promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptotic processes via the activation of downstream targets such as BAD and caspase-9. Besides, AKT1 is a critical modulator of glucose metabolism through its regulation of glucose uptake and utilization.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
Several mutations in the AKT1 gene have been associated with various diseases. Here are some examples of AA mutations and their corresponding disease type with dbSNP ID:
- E17K: This is a missense mutation that results in constitutive activation of the AKT1 protein. This mutation has been linked to breast, colorectal, ovarian, and lung cancer. (dbSNP ID: rs121434592)
- G49A: This is another missense mutation that has been associated with ovarian cancer. (dbSNP ID: rs2294008)
- R50H: This is a missense mutation that has been associated with schizophrenia development. (dbSNP ID: rs1130233)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
Various somatic mutations in AKT1 have been identified in different cancer types.
- G205A: A somatic mutation identified in breast cancer samples. (dbSNP ID: rs121434599)
- G49A: This somatic mutation has been identified in ovarian and pancreatic cancer. (dbSNP ID: rs2294008)
- G378T: Somatic mutation identified in colorectal cancer. (dbSNP ID: rs397514697)

### Related disease: 
Some of the diseases associated with the AKT1 gene are:
- Cancer (breast, colorectal, ovarian, and lung cancer)
- Schizophrenia
- Proteus syndrome

### Treatment and prognosis:
There are no specific treatments available that target the AKT1 gene directly. However, several pharmacological inhibitors of the AKT1 pathway have been developed and tested in clinical trials for various cancer types. The prognosis of patients with AKT1 mutations varies depending on the disease type and severity.

### Drug response:
The AKT1 pathway has been shown to play a role in drug resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents. For instance, inhibitors of AKT1 pathways have been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.
