# Gene MAN2B1

## Genetic Position
The gene MAN2B1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 at the position 13.2 (19q13.2).

## Pathology
Mutations in the MAN2B1 gene have been associated with lysosomal alpha-mannosidase deficiency. This is a rare inherited disorder that affects the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the body. The deficiency leads to an accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in body tissues. This can cause a wide range of symptoms such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, liver and spleen enlargement, and skeletal abnormalities.

## Function
The MAN2B1 gene encodes for the enzyme alpha-mannosidase, which is involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. The enzyme removes specific mannose residues from glycoproteins and glycolipids in the lysosome. This process is crucial for normal cellular functions such as protein and lipid turnover.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there is no known association between somatic SNVs/InDels in the MAN2B1 gene and any specific pathology or disease.

## Related Disease
Alpha-mannosidosis is the primary disease related to mutations in the MAN2B1 gene.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific cure for alpha-mannosidosis. The treatment options are limited to managing the symptoms and complications associated with the disease. Enzyme replacement therapy is being explored as a potential therapeutic option. The prognosis for individuals with alpha-mannosidosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the deficiency caused by mutations in the MAN2B1 gene.
