## Related Diseases
- This gene is associated with several diseases, including:
    - [Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8625849))
    - [Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719298))
    - [Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493969))
    
## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment and prognosis for diseases associated with ABL1 mutation varies depending on the specific disease and individual case. However, drugs that target the ABL1 protein, such as imatinib mesylate, have been developed to treat certain cancers, such as CML.

## Drug Response
- Studies have shown that ABL1 mutations can affect drug response in cancer patients. For example, mutations that lead to drug resistance have been observed in patients receiving treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
