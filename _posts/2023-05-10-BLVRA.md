# BLVRA gene

## Information
The BLVRA gene encodes for biliverdin reductase A, an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of bilirubin. The gene is located on chromosome 7 at position 7q32.1 and spans 17.12 kb. BLVRA is also known by other names such as bilirubin reductase A, BVR-A and FLJ20071.

## Function
The protein encoded by BLVRA gene catalyzes the conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin, which is a waste product formed during the breakdown of heme. This catalytic reaction plays a critical role in the detoxification of heme. Biliverdin reductase A is also involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations documented in BLVRA gene. Some of these mutations are associated with diseases, but most are classified as benign. Here are a few examples of mutations in the BLVRA gene:

| AA mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gln173Lys | Missense | rs186606042 |
| Pro152Leu | Missense | rs17853654 |
| Arg196Gln | Missense | rs2231142 |
| Asn170Asp | Missense | rs150031742 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
In addition to germline mutations, there are also somatic mutations found in BLVRA gene. However, there are no somatic SNVs/InDels associated with any diseases reported in dbSNP database as of October 2021.

## Related Disease
There are some diseases and illnesses associated with mutations in the BLVRA gene. For example, individuals with deficiency in biliverdin reductase A may experience hemolytic anemia, which is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they are produced. Deficiencies in biliverdin reductase A have also been associated with liver disease and neonatal jaundice.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no reported cure for genetic mutations in the BLVRA gene, treatment would instead be focused on managing the symptoms. Patients with hemolytic anemia may be given blood transfusions or medications to boost the production of red blood cells. Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) in newborns can be treated with phototherapy as exposure to light can help reduce bilirubin levels in the blood.

## Drug Response
There are no known drugs that interact specifically with biliverdin reductase A.
