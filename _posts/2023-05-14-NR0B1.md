## Gene NR0B1 
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome X: 77,524,923-77,572,831
- **Pathology**: NR0B1 is a gene that encodes a protein named DAX-1, which plays an important role in sex determination and adrenal gland function. Mutations in this gene can lead to X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita, which is a rare disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
- **Function**: NR0B1/DAX-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor and regulates the expression of several genes involved in steroidogenesis, such as StAR and CYP11A1. It also interacts with other proteins involved in adrenal and testicular development and function, such as SF1 and SRY.
- **External IDs**: HGNC: 7949, NCBI Entrez: 190, Ensembl: ENSG00000164532, OMIM: 300473, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q92841
- **Aliases**: AHC, AHX, DAX1, NROB1, AD4BP, AHCH, AHCX
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**
   - c.412G>A (p.Gly138Arg), rs28934576
   - c.920C>T (p.Arg307Ter), rs104894006
   - c.787G>A (p.Ala263Thr), rs267607672
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**
   - c.358_359insAA (p.Lys120Argfs*7), rs869025262
- **Related Disease**: X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita
- **Treatment and Prognosis**: Treatment may involve hormone replacement therapy to address adrenal insufficiency and delayed puberty. In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age of diagnosis.
