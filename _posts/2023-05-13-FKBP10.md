# Gene FKBP10

## Genetic Position 

The FKBP10 gene is located on the 17th chromosome in humans, specifically at the position 17q21.2.

## Pathology 

The FKBP10 gene encodes a protein called FK506-binding protein 10, which is involved in the synthesis of collagen. Mutations in FKBP10 can lead to various diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and Bruck syndrome.

## Function 

The FKBP10 gene encodes a protein that functions as a molecular chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. It plays an important role in collagen biosynthesis, which is essential for the proper formation of bone and connective tissues. FKBP10 assists in the folding and secretion of procollagen molecules by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues in collagen chains.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID 

The following table lists some of the known mutations in the FKBP10 gene, along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID.

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Arg379Ser | Missense | rs267606851 |
| p.Ile688Thr | Missense | rs863224507 |
| c.532_535dupCAAA | Frameshift | rs761545867 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no records of somatic SNVs/InDels in the FKBP10 gene according to dbSNP.

## Related Disease 

Mutations in the FKBP10 gene have been associated with the following diseases:

- Osteogenesis imperfecta type XI (OMIM #610682)
- Bruck syndrome 1 (OMIM #259450)

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no cure for genetic disorders caused by mutations in the FKBP10 gene, such as OI and Bruck syndrome. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive. In some cases, surgical interventions such as bone grafts or corrective surgeries may be necessary to improve bone strength and prevent fractures. Prognosis depends on the severity and extent of skeletal abnormalities and associated complications.

## Drug Response 

There is no known drug therapy that can target the underlying genetic defect caused by mutations in the FKBP10 gene.
