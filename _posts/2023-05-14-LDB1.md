# Information about gene LDB1 

## Genetic position
- Chromosome: 10
- Genomic position: 112,206,989 - 112,240,347 bp
- Strand: -
- Locus: LIM domain binding 1 (LDB1)

## Pathology 
LDB1 gene mutations have been associated with cancer and cardiac disorders. In cancer, LDB1 mutations have been reported in various cancers including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. In cardiac disorders, LDB1 plays a critical role in cardiac development and cardiac morphogenesis. Mutations in LDB1 can cause congenital heart disease such as atrioventricular septal defect.

## Function 
LIM domain binding 1 (LDB1) protein is a transcriptional co-regulator that assists in DNA transcription activity of several transcription factors. It also acts as a scaffold protein in the formation of multi-protein complexes, which plays a crucial role in the development of various organs.
