## Information about gene RP1

### Gene Function
RP1 (Retinitis pigmentosa 1) is a protein-coding gene that is primarily expressed in photoreceptor cells of the retina. The gene encodes a microtubule-binding protein that is essential for stabilizing and maintaining the structure of the connecting cilium, which connects the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor cells.

### Related Disease
RP1 gene mutations are associated with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) which is a group of inherited retinal disorders that leads to progressive vision loss.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for RP1-related retinal degeneration. However, identification of RP1 gene mutations enables early diagnosis, genetic counseling, and potential therapeutic interventions.

### Drug Response
Not applicable as there are no drug treatments specific to RP1-related retinal degeneration.
