# Information about Gene LGI1

## Genetic Position:
LGI1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 at position 24.13.

## Pathology and Function:
LGI1 gene encodes a synaptic protein, leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1, which is primarily expressed in the nervous system and plays an important role in synaptic transmission. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Autosomal Dominant Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (ADLTE) and other epileptic disorders.

## Function for gene:
LGI1 gene is involved in synaptic transmission, specifically in regulating the AMPA receptor. It also influences the formation and maintenance of the synapses.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- Cys705Tyr (C705Y), Missense, dbSNP ID: rs104894503
- Other pathogenic missense mutations include Arg528His, Arg518Trp, and Thr618Ile.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are no records of somatic SNVs/InDels for LGI1 gene with dbSNP ID.

## Related Disease:
- Autosomal Dominant Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (ADLTE)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
The primary treatment for ADLTE is the use of antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine, which suppress seizures. A ketogenic diet may also be beneficial for some individuals. The prognosis for ADLTE is generally good, with a majority of individuals achieving complete seizure control with treatment.

## Drug Response:
Carbamazepine is proven to be effective for the treatment of seizures caused by mutations in LGI1 gene.
