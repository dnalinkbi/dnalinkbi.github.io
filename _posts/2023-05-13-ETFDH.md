# Gene: ETFDH

## Information
- **Function of the gene:** The ETFDH gene codes for a protein called electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase that is involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the catabolism of amino acids. 
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - Gene ID: 2111
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 4 (4q32.1)
    - Aliases: GA2, MADD
- **External sites:**
    - HGNC: 3482
    - NCBI Entrez: 2108
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000135486
    - OMIM: 231675
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16134

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Ala119Thr (c.356G>A) - rs137853299
    - p.Asp131Tyr (c.391G>A) - rs137853300
    - p.Arg247Cys (c.741C>T) - rs137853302
    - p.Gly296Arg (c.887G>A) - rs137853303
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - No relevant information available.

## Related diseases
- **Disease:** Glutaric aciduria type II / Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by metabolic crises and progressive encephalopathy associated with the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitine species in plasma and urine.
- **Inheritance pattern:** Autosomal recessive
- **Prevalence:** The incidence is estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 births.

## Treatment and prognosis
- **Treatment:** There is no cure for MADD, but the management of the disease is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on avoiding fasting periods, providing a low-fat diet and carnitine supplementation to restore beta oxidation of fatty acids. In some cases, riboflavin supplementation has been shown to improve the clinical course of the disease in affected individuals with pharmacogenetic variants.
- **Prognosis:** The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease and the promptness of treatment. In infants with severe metabolic crisis, the prognosis is poor, while patients with milder forms can have a normal life expectancy.

## Drug response
- **Drug response:** There is no specific drug available for the treatment of MADD. Studies have shown that riboflavin supplementation can improve clinical outcomes in some patients.
