# Gene: MYO5A

### Gene Information: 
- Function: MYO5A gene codes for myosin VA protein which is implicated in melanosome transport and dendritic cell migration. It also plays a role in vesicle transport and actin-based movement.
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 7569
    - NCBI Entrez: 4644
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000132771
    - OMIM: 160777
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UPS6
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 15q21.1

### Genetic Pathology:
- Related Disease: Mutations in MYO5A gene cause Griscelli syndrome type 1, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, large clumps of pigment in hair shafts, and immunological abnormalities. Mutations in this gene are also implicated in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy.
- AA Mutation List and Mutation Types:
    - c.2183A>G/p.Thr728Ala/rs16860242
    - c.3523C>T/p.Arg1175Ter/rs61749290
    - c.3656G>A/p.Arg1219Arg/rs200161648
- Somatic SNVs/InDels:
    - Not reported in COSMIC database.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
- Treatment for Griscelli syndrome type 1 involves clinical management to prevent secondary infections. In some cases, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be necessary. Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by MYO5A mutations is managed with standard heart failure treatment.
- Prognosis for Griscelli syndrome type 1 varies based on the severity of immunological abnormalities and infection management. Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by MYO5A mutations has a poor prognosis, with progressive heart failure and increased risk of sudden death.

### Drug Response:
- No drug response information is available for MYO5A mutations.
