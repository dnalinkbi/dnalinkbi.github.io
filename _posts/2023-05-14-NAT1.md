# Information about Gene NAT1

## Gene NAT1 Information
The NAT1 gene is located on chromosome 8 and is found at the 8p22 position. It is also known by several aliases such as N-acetyltransferase 1, Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1, NATI, and AAC1.

## Gene Function
The NAT1 gene encodes for the enzyme N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1), which is involved in the metabolism of drugs and environmental carcinogens. The enzyme is primarily responsible for the acetylation of arylamines and hydrazines. 

## External IDs and Sites
- **HGNC ID**: 7641
- **NCBI Entrez ID**:  NAT1
- **Ensembl ID**: ENSG00000156006 
- **OMIM ID**: 608206
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID**: P18440

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types
There are several amino acid mutations reported in the NAT1 gene which are associated with various diseases or changes in enzyme activity. Some of the reported mutations along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID are given below:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E187G | Missense | rs4986989 |
| R64W | Missense | rs4986990 |
| I114T | Missense | rs4986991 |
| T341C | Silent | rs4986992 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in the NAT1 gene which are associated with different types of cancers. Some of these somatic variations along with their dbSNP IDs are given below:

- rs56279438
- rs56286621
- rs146576288
- rs75144616

## Related Disease
The NAT1 gene mutations are associated with various diseases such as bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and Parkinson's disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of NAT1 gene-related diseases depend on the severity and nature of the disease. There are different treatment options available for different diseases associated with NAT1 gene mutations, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and targeted therapies.

## Drug Response
The activity of the NAT1 enzyme can affect the metabolism and efficacy of different drugs such as isoniazid, sulfamethazine, and hydralazine. NAT1 activity variations also cause differences in drug response between individuals.
