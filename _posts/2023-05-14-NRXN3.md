## Information about Gene NRXN3

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 14q31.2

**Function:** The NRXN3 gene encodes a neurexin protein which plays a role in synaptic transmission and neuronal communication in the central nervous system. It is involved in the formation and differentiation of synapses during development and is essential for proper brain function.

**Aliases:** KIAA0740, neurexin III, neurexin-3-alpha, NL3
