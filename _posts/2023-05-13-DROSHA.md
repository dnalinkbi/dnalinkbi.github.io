# Genetic Information Analysis: Gene DROSHA

## Brief Overview
Gene DROSHA, also known as Drosha ribonuclease III (DROSHA), is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 5 that encodes for a ribonuclease III enzyme, which is vital for RNA processing and maturation. Mutations or dysregulation of DROSHA have been associated with various disease conditions.

## Function of DROSHA gene
DROSHA is involved in the processing of primary microRNA (miRNA) into precursor miRNA by cleaving the stem-loop structure of the RNA. This protein is an essential component of the microprocessor complex, which includes DGCR8, that initiates miRNA biogenesis.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in DROSHA can cause several disease conditions, including the following:

- DiGeorge Syndrome - caused by a microdeletion of the chromosome 22q11.2 region containing the DGCR8 and DROSHA genes
- Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome - caused by a homozygous mutation in DROSHA

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for genetic mutations causing DROSHA-related pathologies. Treatment options often involve symptomatic management and supportive care.

## Drug Response
There is no known information regarding drug response and DROSHA mutations.
