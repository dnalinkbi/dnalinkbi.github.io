## Gene Information

### Gene: CTHRC1

CTHRC1 stands for Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 gene. It is located at the chromosome 8 (8q22.3) and encodes a protein of 282 amino acids. 

### Function

CTHRC1 is known to play a role in various signaling pathways. It is involved in the development and progression of many types of cancers, including breast, colon, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. CTHRC1 is implicated in regulating cell migration and invasion, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

| 154 | Threonine (T) | Isoleucine (I)   | rs61737519 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Somatic mutations in CTHRC1 have not been extensively studied yet. However, some single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions have been reported in various cancers.

### Related Disease

As previously mentioned, CTHRC1 is implicated in the development and progression of various cancers, such as breast, colon, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. 

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments targeting CTHRC1 for cancer patients. As for the prognosis, studies showed that an elevated expression of CTHRC1 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers. 

### Drug Response

There is no known drug that targets CTHRC1. However, some cancer drugs have been reported to reduce the expression of CTHRC1 in cancer cells.
