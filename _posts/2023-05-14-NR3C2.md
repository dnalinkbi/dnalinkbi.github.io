# Gene NR3C2

## Summary
NR3C2 encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is responsible for mediating the biological effects of aldosterone. Mutations in this gene can lead to salt-losing tubulopathies, pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, and hypertension.

## Function
The NR3C2 gene encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which belongs to a family of nuclear receptors that includes receptors for steroid hormones. MR functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, regulating the expression of genes involved in the control of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. MR is activated by the hormone aldosterone, which is secreted by the adrenal gland in response to changes in blood pressure, serum potassium levels, and other factors.

## Related Disease
- Salt-losing tubulopathies
- Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I
- Hypertension

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease caused by NR3C2 mutations. Salt-losing tubulopathies are treated with oral sodium supplementation and fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I patients may require intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement. Hypertension can be managed with various medications, including diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
