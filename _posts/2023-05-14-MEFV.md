# Gene: MEFV

## Genetic position
MEFV gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p13.3).

## Pathology
Mutations in MEFV gene are associated with an autoinflammatory disorder called Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain, and skin rash.

## Function for gene
MEFV gene encodes a protein called Pyrin or marenostrin which is involved in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis.

There are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported in MEFV gene.

## Related disease
Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment for FMF includes colchicine, which reduces the frequency and severity of attacks and prevents amyloidosis. Prognosis of FMF is generally good if treated with colchicine and complications like amyloidosis are prevented.

## Drug response
Colchicine is the drug of choice for treating FMF and has been found to be effective in most patients. However, there are some patients who do not respond to colchicine and may require alternative treatments.
