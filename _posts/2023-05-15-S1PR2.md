## Gene: S1PR2

### Genetic Position and Aliases
- Chromosome: 19
- Genomic Location: 19p13.2-p13.1
- Gene ID: 9294
- Aliases: EDG5, S1P2, LPB2, RP11-350J8.1

### Function
The S1PR2 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2) gene encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family that responds to signaling by the lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1PR2 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including immunomodulation, vascular development, and cancer.

### Related Diseases
- Asthma
- Multiple sclerosis
- Cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There are currently no FDA-approved drugs targeting the S1PR2 gene, but several S1P pathway modulators are in clinical development for various indications.
- Prognosis and treatment outcomes depend on the specific disease and its stage.

### Drug Response
- S1P pathway modulators, such as fingolimod and siponimod, have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis and are thought to act partially through S1PR2 signaling modulation.
- Several S1PR2 inhibitors are being developed for cancer treatment, although these are not yet approved for clinical use.
