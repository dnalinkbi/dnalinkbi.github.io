## Gene information

**Gene:** RAD50

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 5:129,108,269-129,135,850

**Pathology:** RAD50 gene mutations have been linked to increased risk of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.

## Function

The RAD50 gene is involved in DNA repair and maintenance processes, specifically in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. It plays a critical role in the homologous recombination pathway for DNA repair.

## Related disease

Mutations in the RAD50 gene have been associated with the following cancer types:

- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

## Treatment and prognosis

The treatment and prognosis for RAD50-related cancers may vary depending on the type and severity of the cancer. Some treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Prognosis may also be affected by the specific mutation in the RAD50 gene.

## Drug response

There is currently no specific drug approved for use in RAD50-related cancers. However, research is ongoing to identify potential drug targets for these cancers and develop new treatment options.
