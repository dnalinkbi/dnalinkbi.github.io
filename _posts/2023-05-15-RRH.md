# Gene RRH Information

## Gene Position, Pathology and Function

Gene RRH (Reelin receptor H120D variant) is located on chromosome 2 in the region 2p16.3. This gene is associated with the pathology of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and bipolar disorder. The function of the RRH gene is to encode a transmembrane receptor protein that binds to reelin, a protein involved in neuronal migration and organization during brain development.

## Related Diseases

RRH gene mutations and dysfunction have been associated with various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders including:
- Schizophrenia
- Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Bipolar Disorder

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for RRH gene-related disorders. Treatment options are largely symptom-based and may include medication and therapy. The prognosis for these disorders varies depending on the severity of symptoms and individual response to treatment.

## Drug Response

Research is ongoing to investigate potential drug targets and therapies for RRH gene-related disorders.
