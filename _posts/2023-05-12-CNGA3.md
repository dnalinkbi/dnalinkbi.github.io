## Gene CNGA3 Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 2, position 180,865,139-180,873,746 (GRCh38)
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the CNGA3 gene are associated with retinal disorders such as achromatopsia and cone dystrophy.
- **Function:** The CNGA3 gene encodes a protein called cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha-3 (CNGA3), which is a subunit of the cGMP-gated ion channel found in cone photoreceptor cells of the retina. This channel plays a crucial role in converting light stimuli into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain for visual perception.
- **External IDs:** HGNC: 2148, NCBI Entrez: 1268, Ensembl: ENSG00000169682, OMIM: 600053, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q16281
- **Aliases:** ACHM2, CNCG3, CNGP3, CNG3.
- **AA mutation list with mutation type and dbSNP ID:** There are several reported missense mutations in the CNGA3 gene associated with retinal disorders such as achromatopsia and cone dystrophy. The following are some of the reported mutations:

| AA Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| R283Q     | Missense      | rs104893983 |
| R283W     | Missense      | rs104893984 |
| C110Y     | Missense      | rs104893981 |
| G379D     | Missense      | rs104893982 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are no reported somatic mutations in the CNGA3 gene.
- **Related Diseases:** Mutations in CNGA3 are associated with retinal disorders such as achromatopsia and cone dystrophy.
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is currently no cure for retinal disorders caused by mutations in the CNGA3 gene. Treatment options are limited to supportive measures such as visual aids, special education, and genetic counseling.
- **Drug Response:** There are no specific drugs targeting the CNGA3 protein for the treatment of retinal disorders associated with CNGA3 mutations.
