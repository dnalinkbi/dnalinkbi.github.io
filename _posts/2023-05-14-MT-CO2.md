# Gene MT-CO2

## Genetic Position
MT-CO2 is a gene located on the mitochondrial DNA. It is positioned at MT 7,766-8,603.

## Pathology
Mutations in MT-CO2 have been associated with Leigh syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting mitochondrial function.

## Function
MT-CO2 encodes a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is involved in the electron transport chain and catalyzes the conversion of molecular oxygen to water.
