# Gene AGK 

- Function: The AGK gene encodes for an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial phospholipid essential for energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.

    - Ensembl: ENSG00000106006
    - OMIM: 615904
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q53H90

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
    - p.Asp32Asn (rs142764234)
    - p.Ile439Val (rs863225388)
    - p.Arg407Cys (rs863225390)

- Related disease: Mutations in the AGK gene have been associated with Barth syndrome, a rare X-linked disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and neutropenia.

- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment for Barth syndrome is mainly supportive and involves addressing the symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and close monitoring is necessary.

- Drug response: No specific drug response information is currently available.
