# Gene CEMIP

## Genetic Position
The CEMIP gene is located on chromosome 15q24.2.

## Pathology
CEMIP has been implicated in various diseases, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and liver fibrosis.

## Function
CEMIP encodes a transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. It also plays a role in extracellular matrix remodeling and is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis.
