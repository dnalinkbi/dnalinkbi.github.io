## Gene: BCKDHA

### Genetic Position: 
BCKDHA is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

### Pathology:
Mutations in the BCKDHA gene are known to cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the way the body processes certain amino acids. MSUD leads to a buildup of these amino acids in the blood and urine, which can cause brain damage, seizures, and even death if left untreated. 

### Function:
The BCKDHA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD complex), which is involved in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as valine, isoleucine, and leucine. The BCKD complex catalyzes the second step in the catabolism of BCAAs, converting their alpha-keto acids to acyl-CoA derivatives which can enter the citric acid cycle and be used for energy generation or other metabolic processes.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
No records of somatic SNVs/InDels were found in dbSNP.

### Related disease:
- Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) 

### Treatment and prognosis:
The primary treatment for MSUD is a strict low-protein diet that restricts the intake of BCAAs through foods such as meat, dairy, and certain grains. Supplementation with thiamine and other B vitamins may also be beneficial. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered as a treatment option. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the age at diagnosis, but early detection and treatment can help improve outcomes.

### Drug response:
There is limited research on drug response and BCKDHA mutations. However, some studies suggest that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation may have a positive effect on MSUD symptoms in some individuals.
