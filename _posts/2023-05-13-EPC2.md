# Gene: EPC2

## Information

### Genetic position
The EPC2 gene is located on chromosome 17 at position q11.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the EPC2 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive disorders, including congenital heart defects and developmental delays.

### Function
The EPC2 gene codes for a protein that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is thought to interact with other proteins to form a complex that plays a role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation.
