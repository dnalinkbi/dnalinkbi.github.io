# Gene: LHCGR

## Genetic Position
- Located on chromosome 2
- Base pairs: 50,744,365 - 50,753,891
- Strand: Plus

## Pathology
- LHCGR mutations have been found to be associated with a variety of reproductive disorders such as hypogonadism, hypergonadotropic ovarian failure, and familial male-limited precocious puberty.

## Function
- LHCGR encodes luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor which is a transmembrane receptor protein expressed in gonadal and extragonadal tissues that binds to and activates luteinizing hormone and chorionic gonadotropin leading to downstream signaling events affecting steroid hormone production in the gonads.

- c.449T>C (p.Leu150Pro) - rs200959102
- c.770A>G (p.Asn257Ser) - rs28364997

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- c.1571C>T (p.Pro524Ser) - rs143568307
- c.2432G>A (p.Arg811His) - rs74315358

## Related Disease
- Familial male-limited precocious puberty
- Hypergonadotropic ovarian failure
- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 2 with or without anosmia

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for LHCGR-related disorders may include hormone replacement therapy and medications that suppress gonadotropin levels. The prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and its severity.

## Drug Response
- Certain LHCGR mutations have been found to affect the response to medications that target the receptor, such as human chorionic gonadotropin.
