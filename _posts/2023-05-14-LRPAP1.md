# Information about Gene LRPAP1

## Genetic Position
LRPAP1 is a gene located in the chromosome 4q32 region.

## Pathology
LRPAP1 is associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and glaucoma.

## Function
LRPAP1 encodes for a protein named low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 (LRPAP1). This protein is involved in the regulation of receptor-mediated uptake of various macromolecules, cell adhesion, and signaling.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 6693  
- NCBI Entrez: 4037  
- Ensembl: ENSG00000164132  
- OMIM: 600065  
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P30533  
- Aliases: A2MR, CD91, RAP, MEGALIN-binding protein 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
LRPAP1 gene has various missense mutations that may lead to the development of various diseases. Table 1 shows some of the mutations and their corresponding disease association with dbSNP IDs.

| AA Change   | Mutation Type | Disease Association | dbSNP ID   |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| R240H       | Missense      | Parkinson's Disease   | rs11467548 |
| D296N       | Missense      | Alzheimer's Disease   | rs1808776  |
| P351L       | Missense      | Glaucoma             | rs116100784|
| S464N       | Missense      | Alzheimer's Disease   | rs1808777  |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
LRPAP1 has some somatic mutations in various cancer types, here are some of them:
- Breast Invasive Carcinoma: rs61754860
- Lung Adenocarcinoma: rs58548690
- Prostate Adenocarcinoma: rs587782919

## Related Disease
LRPAP1 mutations are associated with the development of various diseases. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and glaucoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for LRPAP1 mutations. However, treatment options for associated diseases are available depending on the patient's condition and stage of the disease.

## Drug Response
LRPAP1 is not a drug target; hence, there is no specific drug that targets this protein.
