# Information about gene FBLN2

### Genetic Position
The gene FBLN2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3, specifically on the band 3p25.1.

### Pathology
FBLN2 mutations have been found to be associated with various diseases affecting different body systems such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and skeletal systems.

### Function
The FBLN2 gene encodes for the protein Fibulin-2 which is involved in elastic fiber assembly in various tissues including the skin, lungs, and blood vessels. It also plays a role in tissue development and wound healing.
