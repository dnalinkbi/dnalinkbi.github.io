# Gene PPP3CA

**Function:** PPP3CA encodes for a catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme. PPP3CA is involved in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PPP3CA forms a heterotrimeric complex with a regulatory subunit and a scaffolding subunit. The complex acts on a variety of substrates including kinases, receptors, and transcriptional regulators.
