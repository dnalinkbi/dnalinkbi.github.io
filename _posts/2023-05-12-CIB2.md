# Information about gene CIB2

## Genetic Position and Pathology
The CIB2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q25.1) in humans. Mutations in this gene are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, autosomal recessive, type 48 (DFNB48).

## Function
The CIB2 gene encodes for calcium and integrin-binding protein 2, which is involved in regulating calcium signaling and maintaining the structure of the stereocilia in hair cells of the inner ear.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the CIB2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CIB2 gene are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, autosomal recessive, type 48 (DFNB48).

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for DFNB48-associated hearing loss. Treatment options include the use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, and auditory training.

## Drug Response
There is currently no reported drug response for DFNB48-associated hearing loss.
