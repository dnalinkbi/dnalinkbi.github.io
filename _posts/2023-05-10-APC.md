# Gene: APC

## Gene Position
The APC gene is located on chromosome 5q21-q22.

## Pathology
APC is a tumor suppressor gene and is commonly associated with the development of colorectal cancer. Mutations in the APC gene are responsible for the development of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Gardner syndrome.

## Function
The function of the APC gene is to produce a protein called adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which helps regulate cell division and prevent the formation of tumors.

- Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
- Gardner syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
Surgical removal of the colon is the most common treatment for individuals with FAP or Gardner syndrome. Early screening and detection can also improve prognosis.

## Drug Response
There are currently no drugs directly targeting the APC gene. However, chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with FAP.
