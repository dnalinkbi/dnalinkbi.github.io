# Genetic Information for Gene PDE6H  

## Gene Information  
### Function  
The PDE6H gene encodes the enzyme phosphodiesterase 6H, which plays a role in the phototransduction process in the retina.  

### External IDs and Genomic Location  
- Gene ID: 5158  
- Genomic location: chromosome 12q21.2  
- Aliases: GMP-PDEgamma  

### External Sites  
- HGNC: 8805  
- NCBI Entrez: 5158  
- Ensembl: ENSG00000182460  
- OMIM: 600827  
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13956  

## Mutations and Variations  
### AA Mutation List and Mutation Types  
- R262X (stop-gain) with dbSNP ID rs121909310  
- A546V (missense) with dbSNP ID rs267606894  

### Somatic SNVs/InDels  
N/A  

## Related Disease  
Mutations in the PDE6H gene have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP), which is an inherited progressive disorder that causes degeneration of the retina.  

## Treatment and Prognosis  
Currently, there is no cure for ARRP. However, there are some treatments that may help slow the progression of the disease and manage symptoms, such as vitamin A supplementation and certain medical devices. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.  

## Drug Response  
N/A
