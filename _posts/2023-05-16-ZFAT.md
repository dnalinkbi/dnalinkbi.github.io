# Gene ZFAT

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Genetic Position:** ZFAT gene is located on the human chromosome 8q22.3.
- **Pathology:** Studies have found a correlation between ZFAT gene expression and malignant tumors.

## Function
- **Function for gene:** ZFAT gene encodes for a transcription factor that binds to specific cis-acting DNA sequences and regulates gene expression related to immune response and development of lymphocytes.

    - c.1303A>C (dbSNP ID: rs1057517945)
- **Mutation Type:** Point mutations

## Related Disease
- Studies have linked ZFAT with several diseases related to immune response and lymphocyte development, including:
    - Autoimmune diseases
    - Cancer
    - Immunodeficiency

## Treatment and Prognosis
- As the role of ZFAT in malignant tumors is still being studied, there is currently no specific treatment or prognosis available related to its expression.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no information on drug response associated with ZFAT gene expression or its mutations.
