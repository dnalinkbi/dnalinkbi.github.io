# Information about Gene SLC5A3

## Genetic Position  

- The gene SLC5A3 is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 21 at position 21.1.  

## Pathology  

- Mutations in SLC5A3 gene can cause congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diarrhea, weight loss, and dehydration.

## Function for Gene  

- SLC5A3 encodes a sodium myo-inositol cotransporter protein that enables the absorption of myo-inositol and sodium ions from the small intestine. The protein is also involved in glucose and galactose transport.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID  

- No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID are reported in SLC5A3 gene at present.

## Related Disease  

- Congenital Sodium Diarrhea (CSD)

## Treatment and Prognosis  

- There is no definitive treatment for CSD yet. The main care for affected individuals includes supportive management to correct dehydration through fluid replacement and electrolyte therapy. Prognosis varies and depends on the severity of diarrhea and the length of time it persists.

## Drug Response  

- There is no known drug response in relation to SLC5A3 gene at present.
