# Gene: DNAH9

## Information:

### Pathology and Function

DNAH9 is a gene that encodes for dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 9. It is involved in cilium movement and has been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the motile cilia of the respiratory tract, causing recurrent respiratory infections.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported yet. 

### Related Diseases

- Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) 

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is currently no cure for PCD, but treatment options include antibiotics for infections, airway clearance techniques, and supportive care. The prognosis for individuals with PCD varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the presence of other associated health conditions.

### Drug Response

There is currently no information on drug response associated with DNAH9 mutations.
