# Gene: COL22A1

## Information
COL22A1 is a gene that encodes for type XXII collagen. This collagen is a component of extracellular matrix and helps in maintaining structural integrity of various tissues.

**External IDs**: HGNC:32175, NCBI Entrez:57493, Ensembl:ENSG00000184053, OMIM:610018, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9ULZ8

**Aliases:** N/A


## Function
Type XXII collagen provides structural support to various tissues like cartilage, bone, and cornea. It is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration.

## Mutations
### Inherited mutations
Some known inherited mutations in COL22A1 are:

* p.Trp395Cys - rs121912666
* p.Val528Met - rs150935758
* p.Arg179Cys - rs121912727
* p.Ser586Leu - rs769137963

### Somatic mutations
There are no known somatic mutations in this gene.

## Related disease
Mutations in COL22A1 have been associated with the development of a rare condition known as Knobloch syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in the development of the eye and central nervous system.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is no known cure for Knobloch syndrome and treatment is usually supportive in nature. Patients may require surgical procedures to correct any abnormalities in the eye or central nervous system.

## Drug response
There is no known drug response associated with mutations in COL22A1.
