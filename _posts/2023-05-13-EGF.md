# Gene EGF 
 
## General Information
- Function for gene: The EGF gene encodes a small peptide growth factor that is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. It binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activates downstream signalling pathways.
- External IDs for gene and genomic location: HGNC:3229, NCBI Gene: 1950, Ensembl: ENSG00000138798
- Aliases: URG, HOMG4, EGF1, EGF2, EGF3, EGF4

## Sequence Information
- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: There are 131 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the EGF gene, including missense, synonymous and intronic variants. The most common missense variant is rs4444903 which changes aspartic acid to asparagine at position 42 (D42N).
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Somatic mutations in the EGF gene have been associated with various cancers, including lung, breast and glioblastoma. The COSMIC database lists 19 somatic mutations in EGF, including missense and nonsense mutations.
 
## Related Diseases
- The dysregulation of EGF and its receptor, EGFR, are linked to the progression of many types of cancer.
- Other diseases associated with the EGF gene include psoriasis, schizophrenia, diabetes, and age-related macular degeneration.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Therapies targeting EGFR, such as cetuximab and erlotinib, are used in the treatment of various cancers. However, resistance to these therapies has been observed.
- Inhibition of EGF signalling is a potential target for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration.

## Drug Response
- Polymorphisms in EGF have been linked to variations in drug response and toxicity. For example, the EGF SNP rs4444903 has been associated with a poor response to trastuzumab therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
