## Information about gene BCOR

### Genetic position
BCOR (BCL-6 corepressor) gene is located on chromosome Xp11.4.

### Pathology
Mutations or aberrant expression of BCOR gene have been linked to various diseases such as cancer, oculofaciocardiodental syndrome, and microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome.

### Function
BCOR gene encodes a transcriptional corepressor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development and differentiation of various tissues including heart, brain, and blood vessels. BCOR interacts with histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases to modulate chromatin structure and repress transcription of target genes.
