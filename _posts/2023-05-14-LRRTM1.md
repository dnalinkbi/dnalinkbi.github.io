**Gene LRRTM1**

### Genomic Location and IDs
- Gene: LRRTM1 (Leucine-Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1)
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 2 (2p12)
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 26610
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 347730
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000165154

### Function of Gene
LRRTM1 encodes a protein that belongs to the synaptic adhesion molecules family. The encoded protein is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses between neurons in the central nervous system. It regulates excitatory synapse development and is important for the transmission of nerve impulses. LRRTM1 is highly expressed in the brain, especially in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs or InDels have been reported yet.

### Related Disease
- LRRTM1 has been associated with:
    - Schizophrenia: Mutations in LRRTM1 have been linked to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia in some populations.
    - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Polymorphisms in LRRTM1 were found to be associated with ADHD.
