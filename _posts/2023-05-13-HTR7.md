# Gene HTR7

- **Function for gene:** The HTR7 gene provides instructions to make a protein called serotonin receptor 7. This protein is found in the central nervous system and is responsible for transmitting signals from a neurotransmitter called serotonin.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**
    - HGNC ID: HGNC:5246
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 10q23.3
    - Aliases: 5-HT7, 5-HT1F, P2RY14

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several missense mutations reported in the HTR7 gene, some of them are:

| AA Change  | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L82V | Missense | rs1018921 |
| T452Q | Missense | rs143593994 |
| G254R | Missense | rs1378031 |
| P329L | Missense | rs140827041 |

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are several clinical variations (SNVs/InDels) reported in the HTR7 gene, some of them are:

| Variation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c.-496G>A | SNV | rs17194926 |
| c.-247C>G | SNV | rs117223837 |
| c.*181T>A | SNV | rs77446612 |

- **Related disease:** Mutations in HTR7 gene have been associated with several psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disorder linked to the HTR7 gene mutation.

- **Drug response:** Variations in HTR7 gene may influence the response to certain antidepressants such as mirtazapine and agomelatine.
