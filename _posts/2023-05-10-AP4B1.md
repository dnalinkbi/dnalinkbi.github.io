## Gene: AP4B1

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1q32.1

### Pathology
- Associated with Autosomal Recessive Spastic Paraplegia Type 47 (SPG47)
- Mutations in this gene can lead to decreased motor function, developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, and other neurological symptoms.

### Function
- AP4B1 encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is involved in the sorting and trafficking of membrane proteins.
- Specifically, AP-4 is thought to play a role in the sorting of proteins that contain certain motifs within their cytoplasmic domains, such as those that contain type 1 and type 2 dileucine signals.
