### Somatic Mutations
- There are currently no reported somatic mutations in MT-TI.

### Related Diseases
- MT-TI mutations have been associated with a range of mitochondrial diseases, particularly those affecting the nervous system such as encephalopathy, myopathy, and Leigh Syndrome.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for mitochondrial diseases caused by MT-TI mutations are limited. Currently, supportive therapies such as physical therapy and respiratory support are used to manage symptoms.
- The prognosis for individuals with MT-TI mutations can vary depending on the specific mutation and severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response for individuals with MT-TI mutations.
