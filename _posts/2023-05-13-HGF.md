# Information about Gene HGF

## Genetic Position
The HGF gene (also known as Hepatocyte Growth Factor) is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21.11) in humans.

## Pathology
Mutations in the HGF gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly cancers. The overexpression of HGF can promote tumor growth and metastasis.

## Function for Gene
HGF is a protein that functions as a growth factor and is involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth, cell motility, and tissue regeneration. HGF binds to the c-Met receptor, which activates downstream signaling pathways regulating these functions.

## Related Disease
Dysregulation of HGF has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, liver disease, and lung fibrosis.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Targeting HGF/c-Met signaling has been investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer. HGF inhibition could prevent tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibitors of HGF/c-Met are currently in clinical trials for several types of cancer.

## Drug Response
The response to HGF/c-Met inhibitors may vary depending on the specific cancer and its genetic profile. However, some promising results have been reported in clinical trials.
