# Gene MSH2

## Information
MSH2 is a protein coding gene located on chromosome 2q22. It encodes for a DNA mismatch repair protein that plays an important role in maintaining genomic stability. Mutations in this gene can lead to a variety of cancers including Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and other types of tumors.

## Function 
The primary function of MSH2 is to recognize and bind to DNA mismatches that occur during replication and repair them to maintain genomic stability. It interacts with other proteins in the DNA mismatch repair pathway to correct errors in DNA sequence and prevent the development of mutations.

## AA Mutation List
There are several amino acid mutations found in MSH2 that are linked to various diseases. Some of them include:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| p.Pro622Leu | Missense Mutation | rs63750860 |
| p.Ala636Thr | Missense Mutation | rs63750909 |
| p.Gly674Asp | Missense Mutation | rs61754026 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels 
There are numerous somatic SNVs/InDels found in MSH2. Here are a few examples with their dbSNP IDs:

| Mutation | dbSNP ID |
|----------|----------|
| c.2265_2266delAG | rs267607104 |
| c.2314_2317delAAAC | rs779614193 |
| c.943A>C | rs1057519993 |

## Related Diseases 
Mutations in MSH2 are associated with several diseases including:

- Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch Syndrome
- Muir-Torre Syndrome
- Turcot Syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for MSH2-related cancers usually involves surgical removal of the tumor followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with MSH2-related cancers largely depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response 
Certain drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of MSH2-related cancers. However, drug response can vary depending on the specific tumor and the patient's individual genetic makeup.
