## Gene: IL2RA

### Function

The IL2RA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor, which plays a crucial role in immune response regulation and T-cell activation.

### External IDs and aliases

- Gene ID: 3559

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

There are multiple AA mutations reported for the IL2RA gene, including:

- R215G (rs2104286)
- I203T (rs2104285)
- L74V (rs1517412)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

Several somatic mutations have been reported for the IL2RA gene, including:

- rs11191082
- rs11191080
- rs11191081

### Related disease

IL2RA mutations have been associated with various autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

### Treatment and prognosis

IL2RA-targeted therapies, such as daclizumab and basiliximab, have been approved for the treatment of some autoimmune diseases. The prognosis for individuals with IL2RA mutations varies depending on the specific disease and individual circumstances.

### Drug response

Studies have shown that IL2RA genetic variants can affect the response to certain autoimmune disease treatments, such as interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.
