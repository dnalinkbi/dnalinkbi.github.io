## Gene GALNT6

### Genetic Position
The gene GALNT6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 at position q24.31. It spans a region of about 170 kb and consists of 13 exons.

### Pathology
Mutations in the GALNT6 gene have been associated with several human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cancer.

### Function
The GALNT6 gene encodes a protein called N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 6 (GalNAc-T6), which adds the sugar moiety N-acetylgalactosamine to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of a protein. This post-translational modification is essential for the proper functioning of many proteins, including cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and hormones.
