## Function
The C10orf2 gene encodes for the DNA2 nuclease/helicase protein that plays a crucial role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. It is responsible for the processing of long flaps in DNA strand intermediates during Okazaki fragment maturation, DNA end processing, and double-strand break repair.
