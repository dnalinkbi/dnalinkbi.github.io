## Gene Information

- Gene name: GJB3
- Chromosomal location: 1p34.3-p32.3
- Protein product: Connexin-31
- Function: The GJB3 gene encodes connexin-31, a gap junction protein that forms channels that allow for the exchange of small molecules and ions between cells. Connexin-31 is expressed in the skin, inner ear, and other organs.

## Gene and Genomic Location

- Gene ID: 2706
- Genomic location: 1:189,740,601-189,773,163
- Aliases: DFNA2, CX31, EKV3

- HGNC: 4276
- NCBI Entrez: 2706
- Ensembl: ENSG00000143637
- OMIM: 603324
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95452

## Mutation Information

- AA Mutation List: Several mutations in the GJB3 gene have been identified in various populations. These include missense mutations (e.g. c.38G>A, c.278G>A), nonsense mutations (e.g. c.109C>T), and frameshift mutations (e.g. c.75_76delCA). 
- Mutation Type: Missense, Nonsense, Frameshift
- dbSNP IDs: rs104894391, rs121909167, rs104894390

## Related Disease

- Several genetic disorders have been associated with mutations in the GJB3 gene, including erythrokeratodermia variabilis, Clouston syndrome, and sensorineural hearing loss. 

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatment options for GJB3-related disorders are limited and generally focus on managing symptoms. 
- The prognosis for individuals with GJB3-related disorders varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response

- There is limited information on drug response in individuals with GJB3-related disorders.
