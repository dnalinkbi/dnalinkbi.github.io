## Gene ATCAY
ATCAY is the gene symbol for "ATCAY, Caytaxin" which is located on the long arm of chromosome 19. It is present at position 13.3.

### Function for gene
The ATCAY gene encodes a protein known as Caytaxin which is predominantly expressed in the brain. The protein plays a role in intracellular trafficking and signaling.
