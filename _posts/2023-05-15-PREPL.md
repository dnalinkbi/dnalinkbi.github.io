# Information about Gene PREPL

## Genetic Position and Pathology
The PREPL gene is located on chromosome 2q37.3 and is associated with hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome (HCS), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neonatal or infantile onset of hypotonia, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and cystinuria type I. 

## Function
The PREPL gene encodes a prolyl endopeptidase-like protein that is involved in the processing and maturation of oligopeptides and neuropeptides in the secretory pathway. 

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 18029
- NCBI Entrez: 9587
- Ensembl: ENSG00000115267
- OMIM: 609029
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8WU19

Aliases: Prolyl oligopeptidase-like protein, Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase 2, PEPPII-related protein

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported in the PREPL gene associated with hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome. Here are some examples: 

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type   | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| R136Q       | Missense        | rs267607117 |
| R541H       | Missense        | rs758349547 |
| R583W       | Missense        | rs778301408 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Limited information is available on somatic mutations in the PREPL gene, suggesting that it may not play a significant role in cancer development or progression.

## Related Disease
The PREPL gene is associated with hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome (HCS) as mentioned earlier.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Management of hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome usually involves aggressive hydration and urine alkalization to prevent cystine stone formation and the use of high-dose vitamin B6 to improve cystine clearance. There is currently no cure for HCS, and treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life for affected individuals.

## Drug Response
No information is currently available regarding drug response specific to PREPL gene mutations.
