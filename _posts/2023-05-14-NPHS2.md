## Gene: NPHS2 (NPHS2  nephrosis 2, podocin)

- Function for gene: 
  - NPHS2 is involved in the maintenance of the kidney filtration barrier. It plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the podocyte foot process.

  - Genomic location: Chromosome 1p36.33

- AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
  - c.425G>A p.Glu142Lys rs61747728 
  - c.631_633delTCT p.Phe211del rs28896323 
  - c.718A>G p.Asn240Ser rs41273268 

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
  - None reported

- Related disease:
  - Mutations in NPHS2 are associated with hereditary nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema.

- Treatment and prognosis:
  - Treatment for hereditary nephrotic syndrome may include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. In some cases, kidney transplantation may be necessary.
  - Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the mutations and the responsiveness of the patient to treatment.

- Drug response:
  - There is limited information on drug response for NPHS2 mutations.
