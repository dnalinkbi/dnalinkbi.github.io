# Gene EMD

## Genetic Position and Pathology
The EMD gene is located on the X chromosome (Xq28). Mutations in this gene have been identified as the cause of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), a rare genetic disorder that affects skeletal and cardiac muscles. EDMD is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting that begins in childhood and progresses slowly over time. 

## Function for Gene 
EMD encodes a protein called emerin which is a nuclear membrane protein and forms part of the nuclear envelope structure. Emerin plays a role in various cellular processes including DNA replication, gene expression, and cell signaling.

- NCBI Entrez: 2010
- Ensembl: ENSG00000104320
- OMIM: 300384
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P50402 

Aliases: EDMD, STA, EDMD1, STA1, X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Glu33Lys (rs121912777)
- p.Gly46Ala (rs121912778) 
- p.Ala67Thr (rs28897708)

These mutations are missense mutations, which result in a single amino acid change in the emerin protein. 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID 
There are currently no known somatic mutations in EMD.

## Related Disease 
The mutations that occur in EMD are associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) which is a rare genetic disorder involving progressive musculoskeletal degeneration. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for EDMD, but treatment is available to manage the symptoms of the disorder including physiotherapy, orthopedic devices, and pacemakers for cardiac issues. The prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and can vary from mild disabilities to severe muscle wasting and cardiac complications. 

## Drug Response 
There is currently no known drug response or targeted therapy for EDMD.
