# Information about gene BRCA2

## Genetic position, pathology, and function
- **BRCA2** is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 13q13.
- Pathologically, mutations in the BRCA2 gene have been shown to increase an individual's risk of developing breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.
- The function of the BRCA2 gene is to code for a protein that plays a role in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability.

## Function for gene
The BRCA2 protein interacts with other proteins to form a complex that is involved in repairing damaged DNA, particularly double-stranded breaks. The protein helps to recruit and organize the other proteins necessary for successful repair of DNA.

## Related disease
- Inherited mutations in BRCA2 increase the risk of developing breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment options for BRCA2-related cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.
- Prognosis varies depending on the type and stage of cancer.

## Drug response
- Individuals with BRCA2-related cancer may respond differently to certain types of chemotherapy drugs, such as platinum-based therapies.
