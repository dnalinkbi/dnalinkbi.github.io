# Information about Gene LECT2

## Genetic Position
- LECT2 gene is located on the chromosome 5q31.1.

## Pathology and Function
- LECT2 encodes the protein leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2).
- LECT2 is involved in the regulation of inflammation, immune response, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.
- Dysregulation or mutations in LECT2 have been linked to various diseases such as liver diseases, inflammatory disorders, and cancer.
