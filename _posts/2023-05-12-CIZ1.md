# Gene CIZ1

## Genetic Position
The CIZ1 gene is located on chromosome 9 at the position 9q34.11.

## Pathology
Aberrations of the CIZ1 gene have been implicated in various diseases including cancers like cervical cancer, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Additionally, alterations in CIZ1 have also been associated with spermatogenic failure.

## Function
The CIZ1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation.
