## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** KCNAB1
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 1, 1p36.22
- **Aliases:** KVÎ²1, Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit beta-1

## Function
KCNAB1 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that modulates the activity of Kv1 channels. The protein encoded by this gene is one of four members of the potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNAB family, which belongs to the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) family.

## Related Disease
The mutation in KCNAB1 gene is associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for KCNAB1-related epilepsy depend on the severity and frequency of seizures. Antiepileptic drugs can help reduce the number and severity of seizures in most cases.

## Drug Response
There is not much information about the drug response of the KCNAB1 gene. However, several studies have suggested that KCNAB1 mutations might predict the benefit of certain antiepileptic drugs, including lamotrigine and carbamazepine.
