# Information about Gene FAM175A

## Genetic Position
The FAM175A gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q22.1).

## Pathology
Mutations in the FAM175A gene have been implicated in various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in DNA damage repair and is thought to play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Loss of function mutations in FAM175A may result in defective DNA repair and increased susceptibility to cancer.

## Function
The FAM175A gene encodes a protein called Abraxas, which is a subunit of the BRCA1-A complex. This complex is involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Abraxas is essential for the localization of the BRCA1-A complex to DNA damage sites, where it initiates the repair process.

- NCBI Entrez: 79184
- Ensembl: ENSG00000181027
- OMIM: 613109
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9NUN5

Aliases for the gene FAM175A include:
- Abraxas
- CCDC98
- MGC16728

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations that have been reported for the FAM175A gene, including:
- p.Arg361Gln (rs146397542)
- p.Ser404Leu (rs267607210)
- p.Asn446Ser (rs747482951)

All of these mutations are missense mutations, which means that a single nucleotide change in the gene results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the Abraxas protein sequence.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the FAM175A gene that have been linked to various cancer types, including:
- p.Glu29Val (rs1555204705)
- p.Arg27Ter (rs767258766)
- p.Glu57Gly (rs767566253)

These mutations are all single nucleotide variants or small insertions/deletions that occur in the FAM175A gene in cancer cells.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the FAM175A gene have been implicated in various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The exact treatment and prognosis for patients with FAM175A mutations depends on the specific type and stage of cancer. In general, however, defects in DNA damage repair pathways can make cancer cells more sensitive to certain types of chemotherapy. In addition, it may be possible to target the BRCA1-A complex itself for cancer therapy.

## Drug Response
There is evidence to suggest that cancer cells with mutations in the FAM175A gene may be more sensitive to certain types of chemotherapy, including PARP inhibitors and platinum-based drugs.
