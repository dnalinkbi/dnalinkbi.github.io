# Information about Gene PQBP1

## Genetic Position
PQBP1 is located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.23. It spans approximately 105.4 kb of genomic DNA.

## Pathology
Mutations in PQBP1 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders including Renpenning syndrome, Sutherland-Haan syndrome, and clinical features overlapping with microcephaly and intellectual disability.

## Function
PQBP1 is a nuclear protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. It also plays a role in synaptic function and dendritic spine maintenance.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gln99Ter (nonsense) with dbSNP ID rs200447090
- p.Ser155Leu (missense) with dbSNP ID rs796052665
- p.Thr203Met (missense) with dbSNP ID rs757906973

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in PQBP1 gene.

## Related Disease
- Renpenning syndrome: This is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and dysmorphic features.
- Sutherland-Haan syndrome: This is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, seizures, and distinctive facial features.
- Intellectual disability: Several mutations in PQBP1 gene have been associated with non-syndromic forms of intellectual disability.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Renpenning syndrome or Sutherland-Haan syndrome, and treatment focuses on management of symptoms and supportive care. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
No specific drug response has been associated with mutations in PQBP1 gene.
