## Gene MYH3

### Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Location:** Chromosome 17: 15,276,143 - 15,294,697 
- **Pathology:** MYH3 gene mutations are associated with distal arthrogryposis (DA), a genetic disorder characterized by joint contractures affecting the distal parts of the limbs. 

### Function
The MYH3 gene encodes the embryonic myosin heavy chain, which is involved in muscle contraction and development.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for the MYH3 gene.

### Related Disease
Distal Arthrogryposis type 1A, 1B, 2A, and 3

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for DA is supportive and depends on the affected areas. Early intervention with stretching, casting, and splinting may improve joint mobility and prevent further contractures. Recurrence risk depends on the type of DA and the mode of inheritance. The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the contractures and the organs involved.

### Drug Response
There are no known drug responses for the MYH3 gene.
