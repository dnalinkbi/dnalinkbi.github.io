## Information about Gene FH

### Genetic Position: 
The gene FH is located on chromosome 1q22-q23.

### Pathology: 
Mutations in the FH gene are associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign smooth muscle tumors (leiomyomas) of the skin and uterus as well as aggressive forms of kidney cancer.

### Function of Gene FH: 
The FH gene encodes for the fumarate hydratase enzyme, which is involved in the Krebs cycle and plays an essential role in cellular metabolism.

### Related Disease: 
Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Treatment options for HLRCC syndrome include surgical removal of tumors, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for HLRCC syndrome depends on the extent of the disease and age of onset.

### Drug response:
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs to target FH mutations. However, studies are being conducted to explore the potential of targeted therapies for HLRCC syndrome.
