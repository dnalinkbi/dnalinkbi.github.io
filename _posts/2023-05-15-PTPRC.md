## Information about PTPRC gene

**Gene name:** PTPRC

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 1, location 198,953,675 - 199,027,084

**Pathology:** PTPRC is involved in immune responses, specifically leukocyte activation and T-cell receptor signaling pathways.

**Function:** The protein encoded by PTPRC is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune system function by dephosphorylating and activating Src family kinases. It is expressed on the surface of most leukocytes, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, and is involved in the modulation of their activation states.

**Aliases:** CD45, LCA, LY5, T200

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 9632
- NCBI Entrez: 5788
- Ensembl: ENSG00000081237
- OMIM: 151460
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P08575

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
- R77C (rs200951665)
- A138V (rs150946799)
- T204I (rs200997322)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related disease:** 
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Crohn's disease
- Psoriasis
- Primary immunodeficiency disorders

**Treatment and prognosis:** The involvement of PTPRC in immune function suggests it as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various immune-related diseases. It has been reported that targeting PTPRC with antibodies leads to the depletion of T cells and B cells, making it a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.

**Drug response:** There are no drugs currently targeted specifically at PTPRC. However, there are drugs that target T cells and B cells, which express PTPRC on their surface, such as monoclonal antibodies against CD20 and CD3.
