## Gene: STRC

### Genetic position
The STRC gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q15.3).

### Pathology
Mutations in the STRC gene can result in hearing loss, particularly in the form of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, which can be moderate to profound. 

### Function
The STRC gene encodes a protein known as stereocilin, which is important for the proper function of hair cells in the inner ear. Stereocilin is involved in the formation of tip-links, which connect the stereocilia of hair cells and are critical for the transduction of sound waves into electrical signals.

No somatic mutations listed in dbSNP.

### Related disease
Mutations in the STRC gene are responsible for autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. 

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for hearing loss due to STRC mutations may include hearing aids or cochlear implants. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and age of onset of the hearing loss.

### Drug response
Unknown.
