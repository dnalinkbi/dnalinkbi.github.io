# Genetic Information of Gene GFRA1

## Gene Information

**Gene:** GFRA1

**Function of Gene:** 

* GFRA1 encodes a receptor for the GDNF (glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor) ligand family.
* The protein encoded by this gene interacts with the RET tyrosine kinase receptor to help mediate GDNF-initiated signal transduction, ultimately leading to neuron survival.

**Aliases**: GDNFR, GFRa1

**External IDs and Genomic Location:**

* **HGNC ID:** HGNC:4245
* **NCBI Entrez ID:** 2674
* **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000111236
* **OMIM ID:** 601476
* **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q00978
* **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 10: 64195506-64214517

* Hirschsprung disease (Variant type: Mutation; Inheritance: Autosomal dominant)
* Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (Variant type: Mutation; Inheritance: Autosomal dominant)
* Ovarian cancer (Variant type: Expression; Diagnosis)

## Treatment, Prognosis, and Drug Response

* There are currently no approved drugs that directly target GFRA1. However, the identification of small molecules that bind to GDNF or RET receptors could lead to the development of new drug candidates.
* The prognosis and treatment of GFRA1-related disorders depend on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.
