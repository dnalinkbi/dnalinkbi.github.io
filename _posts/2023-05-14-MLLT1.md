# Gene: MLLT1

## Information
- **Genetic position:** Chromosome 19: 59,799,177-59,807,716
- **Pathology:** MLLT1 is involved in translocations with various partner genes leading to various leukemias. MLLT1 fusion proteins act as transcriptional activators by disrupting the normal function of the MLL complex.
- **Function for gene:** MLLT1 encodes a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with histone methyltransferases to regulate gene expression.
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC ID: 7120
    - NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 4297
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000105679
    - OMIM ID: 159555
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q03111
- **Aliases:** ENL, LTG19, YEATS1

## Related disease
- MLLT1 is associated with various leukemias including acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment for leukemia involving MLLT1 fusion genes typically involves chemotherapy and stem cell transplants. Prognosis varies depending on the specific fusion partner gene.

## Drug response
- There is no known specific drug response associated with MLLT1 mutations.
