# Gene: SALL4

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 20
- Start Position: 30,142,601 bp
- End Position: 30,287,839 bp

## Pathology
SALL4 gene mutations have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Duane-radial ray syndrome
- Okihiro syndrome
- Holt-Oram syndrome
- Acute myeloid leukemia

## Function
SALL4 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the development of stem cells and normal embryonic development. It has been implicated in the regulation of several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/beta-catenin and TGF-beta pathways.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis for SALL4-related diseases vary depending on the specific condition and its severity. Currently, there is no cure for SALL4 mutations, and treatment is often focused on managing symptoms and addressing complications. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There is limited information about drug response for SALL4-related diseases.
