## Gene Information: 

The RNF43 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.31 and is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway which plays an essential role in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. This gene belongs to the RING finger protein family and encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. 

**Function for gene:** 
The RNF43 protein acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein destabilizes Frizzled (FZD)-LGR (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor) receptors, preventing Wnt ligand-mediated signaling. It also regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 

- HGNC: 22383
- NCBI Entrez: 54894
- Ensembl: ENSG00000108515
- OMIM: 610476
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q68DV7

The RNF43 gene has several aliases, including ZNF826, MGC22969, and FAN.

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

The RNF43 gene has several reported missense mutations. Some of the known mutations and their dbSNP IDs are:

- S23N (dbSNP: rs150546679)
- R117C (dbSNP: rs61752612)
- M152K (dbSNP: rs863224528)
- Q331H (dbSNP: rs200303889)
- R377C (dbSNP: rs149427243)

 These mutations affect the protein structure and its function in the Wnt signaling pathway.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

Somatic mutations in the RNF43 gene have been reported in several types of cancer, including colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. Some of the known somatic mutations and their dbSNP IDs are:

- c.1365dup (dbSNP: rs869025978)
- c.1399G>A (dbSNP: rs139893136)
- c.1427T>C (dbSNP: rs147030274)

These mutations also affect the protein structure and function in the Wnt signaling pathway.

**Related Disease:** 
Mutations in RNF43 are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers.

**Treatment and prognosis:**
The treatment for cancer patients with RNF43 mutations is dependent on the specific type and stage of cancer. The prognosis is generally worse for patients with RNF43 mutations, as it is associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence, advanced disease stage, and poor response to chemotherapy.

**Drug response:**
There are currently no specific drugs developed to target RNF43 mutations. However, combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapy shows promise in some cancers, including pancreatic and colorectal cancer.
