## Information about GNRHR Gene

* **Function for Gene:** GNRHR (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor) is a G-protein coupled receptor that binds to GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). This receptor is mainly expressed in the pituitary gland and plays an important role in regulating reproductive functions.

* **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases:**

    - HGNC ID: HGNC:4421
    - Entrez Gene ID: 2798
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000120907
    - OMIM ID: 138850
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P30968
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 4q13.2
    
* **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

    - c.A362G (p.Q121R) - rs1801192
    
* **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported
    
* **Related Disease:** Mutations in the GNRHR gene are associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is characterized by low levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids, leading to delayed or absent puberty and infertility.
    
* **Treatment and Prognosis:** Treatment for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism involves hormone replacement therapy to supplement the missing hormones. The prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.
    
* **Drug Response:** GnRH receptor agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin are used to suppress the pituitary gonadotropin secretion in the treatment of various diseases like prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and precocious puberty.
