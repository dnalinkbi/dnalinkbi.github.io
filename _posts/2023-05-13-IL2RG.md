## Gene Information

- Gene: IL2RG (Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Gamma)
- Chromosome Location: Xq13.1
- Function: Encodes the common gamma chain (Î³c) protein, which is essential for the function of several cytokine receptors, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. These cytokines play important roles in the development and function of immune cells.
- Aliases: CD132, IMD4, SCIDX1, XSCID

## External IDs

- HGNC ID: 6015
- NCBI Entrez ID: 3601
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000168685
- OMIM ID: 308380
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P31785

## Mutations

- AA Mutation list:
  - p.Trp40Cys (rs104894402)
  - p.Arg222*, p.Val265Ala, p.Asp473Asn, p.Arg479*, p.Pro502Leu, p.Glu514Asp, p.Arg518Cys, p.Val586Met, p.Gly589Cys
- Mutation type: Missense, Nonsense, Frameshift
- dbSNP ID: rs104894402

## Somatic Variants

- No somatic variants have been reported for IL2RG in the COSMIC database as of August 2021.

## Related Diseases

- X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (X-SCID)
- X-Linked Lymphoproliferative Syndrome Type 1 (XLP-1)

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for X-SCID.
- Patients with X-SCID who receive HSCT have high survival rates, but may experience complications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease and viral infections.
- Patients with XLP-1 may also be treated with HSCT and/or immunosuppressive therapy, but may have a poor prognosis due to an increased risk of developing lymphomas.

## Drug Response

- IL-2 receptor gamma-targeted gene therapy has shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of X-SCID.
