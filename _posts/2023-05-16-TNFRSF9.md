## Function of Gene TNFRSF9
TNFRSF9 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This gene encodes a co-stimulatory molecule that is predominantly expressed on activated T cells. The protein is a type I transmembrane protein that stimulates the proliferation of activated T cells and enhances T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several amino acid mutations detected in the TNFRSF9 gene. However, many of these mutations are benign or likely benign. The following are some of the missense mutations and their dbSNP IDs: 
- c.317G>A (p.Val106Met) rs35817863
- c.557C>T (p.Pro186Leu) rs149347271
- c.16T>C (p.Ile6Thr) rs145603386

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in TNFRSF9 are not commonly found. However, some SNVs and InDels have been reported in various cancer types. The database COSMIC contains 20 somatic mutations in TNFRSF9. The following are some of the mutations and their dbSNP IDs:
- c.537_550del (p.Asn180_Lys183del) COSM44492
- c.652G>A (p.Gly218Glu) COSM105164

## Related Diseases
The following diseases are associated with mutations in TNFRSF9:
- Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
- Psoriasis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
As TNFRSF9 is involved in the immune system, it has been considered as a target for immunotherapeutic treatment in various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Several antibody-based therapies targeting TNFRSF9 have been developed and are being tested in clinical trials. However, the prognosis and treatment depend on the specific condition and the type of mutation present.

## Drug Response
The drug response to targeting TNFRSF9 is still under investigation. However, some promising results have been obtained with the agonist and antagonist monoclonal antibodies against TNFRSF9. These drugs can activate or inhibit the function of TNFRSF9, respectively. The efficacy and side effects of these drugs are still being evaluated.
