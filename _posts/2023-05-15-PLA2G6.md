# Gene information for PLA2G6

## Overview
PLA2G6 is a gene that encodes for an enzyme called phospholipase A2, which is responsible for breaking down specific types of fats in the body. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a range of neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).

## Function
The main function of the PLA2G6 enzyme is to break down specific types of phospholipids in the body. These phospholipids are important for cell membrane structure and function. When the PLA2G6 enzyme is not functioning properly, phospholipids can accumulate in the body, leading to cell damage and death.

## External IDs and Genomic location
- Gene ID: 8398
- Genomic location: Chromosome 22, region q13.1
- Aliases: iPLA2beta, calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta, group VI phospholipase A2

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: The most common type of mutation is missense, which changes a single amino acid in the protein sequence.
- Mutations type with dbSNP ID: There are a number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with the PLA2G6 gene. The rs7754840 SNP is located in the promoter region of the gene and has been associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease.
- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: Not applicable

## Related diseases
Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene have been associated with a range of neurological conditions, including:
- Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)
- Parkinson's disease
- Alzheimer's disease
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for diseases caused by mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. Treatment options are focused on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Prognosis varies depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms.

## Drug response
There are currently no drugs specifically targeting the PLA2G6 enzyme. However, some drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, such as dopamine agonists and levodopa, may help manage symptoms in patients with mutations in this gene.
