### Information about Gene ANG

#### Genetic Position
The ANG gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at position 14q11.2.

#### Pathology
Mutations in the ANG gene have been associated with diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 9 (ALS9), Polycythemia vera, and Essential thrombocythemia.

#### Function for Gene
The ANG gene encodes for a protein called Angiogenin. Angiogenin is involved in various biological processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.
