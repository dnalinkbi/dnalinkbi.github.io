# Information about Gene POLG

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The POLG gene, also known as polymerase (DNA directed), gamma, is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q25). Mutations in this gene have been associated with various disorders with mitochondrial DNA instability and depletion, including progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Alpers syndrome, and ataxia-neuropathy syndrome.

The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial polymerase gamma, which is responsible for replicating and repairing the mitochondrial genome. This polymerase is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial genome and the proper functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

## Function for Gene
The function of POLG gene is catalyzing the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several mutations have been identified in the POLG gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. These mutations can result in various mitochondrial disorders and can affect the polymerase domain, exonuclease domain, linker region, and other regions of the protein. Here is some aa mutation and mutation type with dbSNP ID 
- p.W748S : Missense_variant, rs113994102
- p.S305R : Missense_variant, rs113994103

- p.Y955C : Missense_variant, rs376094518

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the POLG gene present in different types of cancers, including lung, breast, stomach, and colorectal cancer. Here is a list of some somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- rs587778067 : c.2287G>A, p.Gly763Ser
- rs1064795827 : c.3059G>A, p.Gly1020Asp

- rs797045265 : c.3729G>A, p.Gly1243Ser

## Related Disease
Mutations in the POLG gene have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including:
- Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia
- Alpers syndrome
- Ataxia-neuropathy syndrome
- Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
- Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the POLG gene. Treatment options are limited and generally focus on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the mutations.

## Drug Response
Treatment options for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the POLG gene are limited, and there are no drugs approved specifically for these disorders. However, some drugs have shown potential in treating mitochondrial diseases by targeting mitochondrial function and metabolism.
