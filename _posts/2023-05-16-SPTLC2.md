# Gene: SPTLC2

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 14q24.3

**Pathology:** Mutations in the SPTLC2 gene have been associated with hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSN1), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a progressive loss of sensory function in the distal extremities.  

**Function:** The SPTLC2 gene encodes for a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase enzyme, which is involved in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids.  

**External IDs:** 
- HGNC: 11209
- NCBI Entrez: 9517
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100721
- OMIM: 605713
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BZS1

**Aliases:** SPTB2, LCB2B, PSD1, hLCB2b

**AA mutation list:** 
- p.Ala352Val (rs121908049)
- p.Ile504Leu (rs121908048)

**Mutation type:** Missense

**SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs121908049
- rs121908048

**Related disease:** Hereditary sensory neuropathy type I

**Treatment and prognosis:** There is currently no cure for hereditary sensory neuropathy type I and treatment aims to relieve symptoms. Prognosis may vary depending on the severity of the disease. 

**Drug response:** There is currently no specific drug therapy available for hereditary sensory neuropathy type I, however, some patients have reported relief with off-label use of certain medications such as carbamazepine and gabapentin.
