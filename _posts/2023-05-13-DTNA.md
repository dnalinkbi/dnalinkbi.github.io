# Gene: DTNA

## Genomic Location and Aliases

- Chromosome: 18
- Genomic coordinates: 12,567,678 - 12,596,520 bp
- Alias: D-11, ERC2, DKFZp686O10166, RYR3E, dystrobrevin alpha

## Function for Gene

The DTNA gene encodes dystrobrevin alpha, a component of the dystrophin associated protein complex. The dystrophin associated protein complex plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of muscle cells.
