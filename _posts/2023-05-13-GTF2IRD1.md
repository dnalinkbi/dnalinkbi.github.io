## Gene: GTF2IRD1

### Information
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 7 [14,072,757 - 14,187,380 bp]
- **Pathology**: GTF2IRD1 is associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a developmental disorder.
- **Function**: GTF2IRD1 encodes a transcriptional regulator that plays a role in craniofacial and neurological development.
- **External IDs**: HGNC:4657, NCBI Entrez:9569, Ensembl:ENSG00000105810, OMIM:604318, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:O95500
- **Aliases**: BIRD-2, WBSCR11

### Mutations
- **AA Mutation List**: Several nonsynonymous mutations have been reported in the GTF2IRD1 gene. Some notable examples include:
  - p.Ser29Arg (rs121908155)
  - p.Pro55Leu (rs55703655)
  - p.Arg117Cys (rs78835261)
- **Mutation Type**: Missense
- **dbSNP ID**: rs121908155, rs55703655, rs78835261

### Related Disease
- GTF2IRD1 is associated with Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple systems in the body.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for WBS, but early interventions can improve outcomes for individuals with the condition.
- Individuals with WBS typically have a normal lifespan and can lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support.

### Drug Response
- There is currently no targeted drug therapy for WBS. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and providing appropriate support.
