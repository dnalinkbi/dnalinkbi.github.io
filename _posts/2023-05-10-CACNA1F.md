## Information about Gene CACNA1F

### Genetic Position and Pathology
Gene CACNA1F is located on chromosome Xq21.1 and is associated with X-linked ocular albinism type 2 (OA2), a genetic disorder that affects the eyes and leads to reduced pigmentation of the retina and optic nerve. 

### Function for Gene
The CACNA1F gene encodes a protein called alpha-1F subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channel. This channel plays a critical role in the functions of the photoreceptor cells in the retina, the neurons in the brain, and other tissues.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 1391
- NCBI Entrez: 778
- Ensembl: ENSG00000156406
- OMIM: 300110
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O60840
- Aliases: CACFL, CACH4, CACN4, OCA2

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA (amino acid) mutations associated with the CACNA1F gene that cause OA2, including:
- p.Arg513Trp (rs121908871)
- p.Arg513Gln (rs397515412)
- p.Arg518Leu (rs121908872)
- p.Arg518Cys (rs397515413)
- p.Arg528Pro (rs121908873)

All of these mutations are missense mutations, which means that a single nucleotide change in the DNA sequence causes the substitution of one amino acid for another in the encoded protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs or InDels listed for the CACNA1F gene in the dbSNP database.

### Related Disease
As previously mentioned, mutations in the CACNA1F gene are associated with X-linked ocular albinism type 2 (OA2). This disease primarily affects males and can cause vision problems such as poor visual acuity, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), and strabismus (crossed or misaligned eyes).

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for OA2, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms. Treatment options include vision aids such as glasses or contact lenses, and surgery to correct strabismus. The long-term prognosis for individuals with OA2 can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms.

### Drug Response
There is currently no information available on drug response for mutations in the CACNA1F gene.
