## Information about gene AGMO

- **Genetic position:** AGMO is located at chromosome 16q24.2.
- **Pathology:** mutations in the AGMO gene have been associated with the development of prostate cancer.
- **Function for gene:** AGMO encodes for the enzyme Alkylglycerol monooxygenase, which is involved in the catabolism of glyceryl ether lipids. 
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
    - Gene ID (NCBI): 79702
    - HGNC ID:16675
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000140761
    - Alias: FAM108F
    - Genomic location: chr16: 89,059,557-89,103,313.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - No amino acid (AA) mutations have been yet reported on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot for human AGMO.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
    - A few somatic mutations in AGMO have been reported on [COSMIC]([Click](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/analysis?ln=AGMO#variants-tab).) Here are a few examples:
        - c.166G>A (p.G56R) with COSMIC ID COSM1486651
        - c.394_395del (p.P132fs) with COSMIC ID COSM1486650
- **Related disease:** AGMO mutations have been associated with the development of prostate cancer, according to the [OMIM database]([Click](https://www.omim.org/entry/606162).)
- **Treatment and prognosis:** Treatment and prognosis depend on the stage and severity of prostate cancer, which can be influenced by AGMO mutations.
- **Drug response:** No information about drug response related to AGMO is currently available.
