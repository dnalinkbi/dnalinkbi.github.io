# Gene LIPH Information

## Basic Information
LIPH stands for Lipase H. It is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q26.1. LIPH is also known by the following aliases: HOM-TES-103, MGC117170. 
- Gene ID: [3985]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3985))
- Genomic Location: [NC_000003.12]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000003.12),) 3q26.1

## Function
LIPH encodes a member of the lipase family of enzymes. Lipases break down lipids or fats into smaller molecules that can be utilized by the body. LIPH specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate lysophosphatidylcholine and a free fatty acid. LIPH is expressed in many tissues and is known to play an important role in hair growth and development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the LIPH gene in the [dbSNP]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)) database.

## Related Disease
Mutations in LIPH are associated with a rare genetic disorder called autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis. This condition is characterized by sparse, tightly curled hair that is often lighter in color than typical scalp hair and may have an abnormal texture. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no known cure for autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis. Treatment options include hair transplantation, scalp reduction surgery, and cosmetic styling techniques.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information about drug response specific to LIPH mutations.
