## Gene: LY96

### Genomic Location and External IDs

- The LY96 gene is located on chromosome 8 and its position is 8q22.2. 
- The gene is also known by its aliases, including CD14 pathway, ESOP-1, MD-2, and Myeloid differentiation factor 2.

External sites for LY96 include:

### Function 

The LY96 gene encodes a protein called LY96 or Myeloid differentiation protein 2(MD2). It is a secreted protein which belongs to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. MD2 is a co-receptor that when bound to TLR4, promotes the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). 

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations in LY96 can lead to variations in the protein and its function. Some of the amino acid (AA) mutations with dbSNP IDs are:

- R90H: rs11465996
- S38G: rs200479239
- D258Y: rs142693480
- C53F: rs147872441

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- There are some somatic mutations in LY96 gene that are associated with certain types of cancer. 
- One of them is the C38S mutation, which has been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to ovarian cancer.

### Related diseases 

- LY96 is associated with many diseases such as sepsis, infectious diseases, cancer, and inflammatory conditions.
- It has been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. 

### Treatment and prognosis

- The treatment and prognosis of LY96-associated diseases depend on the specific condition and severity of the disease. 
- Targeting TLR4/MD2 signalling and downregulating the expression of LY96 protein have been proposed as potential treatment strategies for certain conditions.

### Drug response

- Some small molecules and monoclonal antibodies have been developed to target LY96 and its associated pathways.
- HM-10260, for example, is a small molecule inhibitor of TLR4-MD2 signaling that has been shown to improve survival in a mouse model of sepsis.
