# Information on gene PYGM

## Gene information
- Gene: PYGM (glycogen phosphorylase, muscle associated)
- Location: Chromosome 11q13.1 
- Alias: GP1, McArdle disease
- Function: The PYGM gene encodes for muscle glycogen phosphorylase, which is involved in the breakdown of glycogen in muscle tissues. This enzyme plays a key role in energy production during physical activity.

## External IDs
- HGNC: 9744
- NCBI Entrez: 5837
- Ensembl: ENSG00000110371
- OMIM: 608455
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P11217

## Mutation information
- AA mutation list: There are many mutations reported in the PYGM gene that result in McArdle disease or glycogen storage disease type V. These include missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Some common mutations include R50X, W797R, and R49X.
- Mutation type: Missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.
- dbSNP ID: rs121907923, rs28941984, rs121907921

## Somatic mutations
- Somatic SNVs/InDels: There are few reported somatic mutations in the PYGM gene. However, some research has found that patients with certain types of cancer may have alterations in the PYGM gene or decreased levels of muscle glycogen phosphorylase.
- dbSNP ID: rs121907923

## Related Disease
- Disease: McArdle disease, Glycogen storage disease type V
- Description: McArdle disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle pain, fatigue, and cramps during exercise due to inability to breakdown glycogen in the muscles.
- Inheritance: Autosomal recessive 
- Risk Factor: A family history of McArdle disease increases the risk factor for developing the condition.

## Treatment and prognosis
- Treatment: There is no cure for McArdle disease, but management includes avoiding activities that can worsen symptoms, especially strenuous physical exercise. Dietary changes such as high protein, low carbohydrate diets or frequent snacks may help maintain energy levels while exercising. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may be recommended.
- Prognosis: The prognosis for McArdle disease is usually good with proper management. 

## Drug response
- Drug response: Creatine supplementation has been shown to improve exercise capacity and reduce fatigue in some patients with McArdle disease. Certain medications may worsen symptoms and are generally not recommended.
