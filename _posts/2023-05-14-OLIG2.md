# Information about Gene OLIG2

## Genetic Position
The OLIG2 gene is located on chromosome 21 at the position q22.11.

## Pathology
The OLIG2 gene has been associated with several neurological disorders such as Schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and gliomas.

## Function
The OLIG2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in the development of the central nervous system, specifically in the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. It also has a role in neuronal development.
