# Gene SEPT9

## Genetic Position
SEPT9 gene is located on chromosome 17q25.3. The gene has 17 exons and spans roughly 72.5 kb.

## Pathology 
The SEPT9 gene plays a vital role in cytokinesis and serves as part of the cytoskeleton. Mutations in this gene are associated with various types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic. Additionally, SEPT9 methylation has also been recognized as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting colorectal cancer. 

## Function 
The protein encoded by SEPT9 plays a role in cytokinesis and cytoskeletal organization. It is involved in cell division and abscission, as well as in microtubule organization.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of cancers associated with SEPT9 mutations vary depending on the type and stage of cancer. However, early detection of colorectal cancer through the use of SEPT9 methylation has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes.

## Drug Response
There is currently no standard treatment for cancers associated with SEPT9 mutations. However, research is ongoing to develop targeted therapies that can effectively treat these cancers.
