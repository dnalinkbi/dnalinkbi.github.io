## Information about gene EIF2B2

**Genetic position:** Chromosome 14q24.3

**Pathology:** Mutation in gene EIF2B2 has been associated with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), which is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of brain white matter.

**Function for gene:** EIF2B2 encodes for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta, which is a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex involved in protein synthesis.

**External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:**

- HGNC: 3297
- NCBI Entrez: 8892
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100990
- OMIM: 606686
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O75874

**AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**

- p.Arg113His (R113H), Missense, rs765387496
- p.Ala168Asp (A168D), Missense, rs1330654159
- p.Lys195Thr (K195T), Missense, rs369825760

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

**Related disease:** Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM)

**Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for VWM. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care.

**Drug response:** Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of VWM. However, studies are ongoing to evaluate potential drug therapies.
