## Gene Information

### Gene Name: POLR3B

### Function: 
The POLR3B gene encodes an enzyme called RNA polymerase III subunit B, which is essential for RNA synthesis. The RNA polymerase III complex is responsible for transcribing specific genes coding for tRNAs, 5S RNA, and non-coding RNA molecules.

### External IDs:
- HGNC: 18336
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 55700
- Ensembl: ENSG00000184845
- OMIM: 614369
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y2Y5

### Genomic location: 
The POLR3B gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q23.3)

### Aliases: 
- MGC131797
- POLR3H
- RPC2

### Related Diseases: 
- Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 10 (HLD10)
- Treacher Collins syndrome

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | -------------| -------- |
| S179L       | Missense     | rs121434594 |
| R477H       | Missense     | rs137853935 |
| R591H       | Missense     | rs137853936 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID: 
There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for the POLR3B gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis: 
There are currently no specific treatments for diseases associated with POLR3B mutations, and management is primarily symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition, and some patients may have a normal lifespan.

### Drug Response: 
There is currently no targeted drug therapy available for diseases related to mutations in the POLR3B gene.
