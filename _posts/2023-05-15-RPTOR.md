## Gene: RPTOR

### Genetic position
RPTOR is located on chromosome 17q25.3.

### Pathology
Mutations and other types of genetic variations in RPTOR have been linked to different types of cancer, such as breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma. 

### Function
RPTOR encodes for the regulatory-associated protein of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). This protein plays a key role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

### Related disease
- Breast cancer
- Renal cell carcinoma
- Prostate cancer

### Treatment and prognosis
There are ongoing clinical trials using mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus, for the treatment of cancer. The prognosis for patients with RPTOR-related cancer may vary depending on other factors, such as the stage of cancer and response to treatment. 

### Drug response 
Studies have shown that some cancer cells with RPTOR mutations may respond differently to mTOR inhibitors, which could impact their effectiveness as a treatment option.
