## Information about gene GNAQ 

### Genetic Position
- Gene: GNAQ 
- Chromosome: 9
- Start Position: 77,823,358 bp 
- End Position: 77,924,081 bp

### Pathology
GNAQ gene mutations are associated with several pathological conditions including Sturge-Weber syndrome, uveal melanoma, and port-wine stain birthmarks. 

### Function 
The GNAQ gene encodes a protein known as guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha that is involved in transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses. GNAQ protein plays a critical role in signal transduction pathways related to cell proliferation and differentiation.

- R183H (rs193302699)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels 
- Chromosome: 9
- Start Position: 77,897,857
- Variant Type: single nucleotide variant (SNV)
- Reference Allele: G
- Alternate Allele: A
- dbSNP ID: rs115541826

### Related Diseases 
- Sturge-Weber syndrome 
- Uveal melanoma 
- Port-wine stain birthmarks

### Treatment and Prognosis 
Treatment options for conditions related to GNAQ gene mutations vary depending on the specific disease and its severity. Current treatment options include but are not limited to systemic chemotherapy, enucleation, and radiation therapy. The prognosis also varies depending on disease stage and treatment options. 

### Drug Response
Studies have shown targeted therapies, including inhibition of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, may have potential therapeutic value for individuals with uveal melanoma or port-wine stain birthmarks associated with GNAQ mutations.
