# Information about gene ATP2B3

## Genetic position, Pathology and Function

**Genetic Position:** ATP2B3 gene is located on chromosome 3q21.1.

**Pathology:** Genetic variations/mutations in ATP2B3 gene can lead to various health conditions including hearing loss, gastric cancer, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease.

**Function:** ATP2B3 gene encodes for a protein called plasma membrane calcium ATPase 3 (PMCA3). This protein is responsible for maintaining the balance of calcium ions across the plasma membrane by pumping out excess calcium from the cells. It plays a critical role in various physiological processes including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and cell signaling.
