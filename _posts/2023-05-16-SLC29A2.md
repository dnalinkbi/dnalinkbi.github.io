# Information about Gene SLC29A2

## Genetic Position
SLC29A2 is located on chromosome 11 at position 11q13.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in SLC29A2 are associated with H syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is characterized by hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hearing loss, and hallmark histologic features including dermal hypercellularity and accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes in the dermis. 

## Function for Gene
SLC29A2 is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family responsible for mediating the transport of natural nucleosides across cellular membranes. It plays a key role in nucleoside homeostasis and in the pharmacokinetics of anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analogs.

## Related Disease
H Syndrome (OMIM: 612391)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for H syndrome, and treatment is largely symptomatic. Steroids have been used to improve some of the skin features, while hearing aids have been helpful for hearing loss.

## Drug Response
No information is available regarding drug response in H syndrome patients.
