### Gene Information

**Gene:** IFNAR2 (interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 2)

**Function for Gene:** IFNAR2 encodes a receptor protein that binds to interferons (IFNs) alpha and beta, and is involved in the activation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These pathways are important in antiviral responses, immune regulation, and anti-tumor activity.

**Aliases:** IFNARB, IFNBR, IFN-R-2

**Genomic Location:** Chromosome 21q22.11

### Related Disease

Mutations or variations in IFNAR2 have been associated with the development of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, IFNAR2 has also been implicated in viral infections such as influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus.

### Treatment and Prognosis

The exact treatment for mutations in IFNAR2 is dependent on the specific disease that the patient is suffering from. In cases of autoimmune diseases, treatment may include immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory agents. For viral infections, treatment may include antivirals, such as interferon-alpha.

The prognosis for patients with mutations or variations in IFNAR2 is also dependent on the specific disease and severity of the condition.

### Drug Response

Several studies have shown that response to treatment with interferon-alpha is dependent on the expression levels of IFNAR2. Specifically, higher levels of IFNAR2 expression have been correlated with better treatment response in hepatitis C virus infection.
