# Gene Information: ACAN

## Gene Function
ACAN (Aggrecan) gene encodes a large modular proteoglycan, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage. It plays a significant role in cartilage morphogenesis, development, homeostasis, and adaptation in response to mechanical stress.

## Gene External IDs and Location
- Gene ID: 176
- Locus: 15q26.1
- Aliases: AGC1, SLCED, MSK16, CSPG1, CSPGCP

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of ACAN-related disorders involves symptomatic care and a multidisciplinary approach. In severe cases, joint replacement surgery may be required. The prognosis varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is limited knowledge about the drug response of ACAN-related disorders. However, recent studies suggest some products (e.g., chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and dietary antioxidants) may improve joint health and reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis.
