## Information about Gene MAX

### Genetic Position
The gene MAX is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q23.3).

### Pathology
MAX gene mutations have been associated with several types of cancer, including small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and glioblastoma.

### Function
The MAX gene codes for a transcription factor that regulates the expression of other genes. It plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation.
