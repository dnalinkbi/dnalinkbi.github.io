# Gene CCL3

## Genetic Position
The CCL3 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2-q12.

## Pathology
CCL3 is associated with chronic inflammation and immune responses.

## Function
The CCL3 gene encodes a protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1Î±). CCL3 is involved in the recruitment of white blood cells to sites of inflammation, and plays a role in immune response regulation.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No significant mutations have been reported in CCL3 in the dbSNP database.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No significant somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in CCL3 in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Aberrant expression of CCL3 has been associated with several diseases, including asthma, cancer, and HIV/AIDS.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are currently no specific treatments targeting CCL3. However, modulation of CCL3 levels has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for conditions in which aberrant CCL3 expression is observed.

## Drug Response
No drugs specifically targeting CCL3 have been approved by the FDA. However, several drugs targeting the chemokine pathway that includes CCL3 are currently being investigated for their potential use in the treatment of inflammatory and immune-related disorders.
