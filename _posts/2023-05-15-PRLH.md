# Gene Information on PRLH

## Summary
PRLH (prolactin releasing hormone) is a gene found in humans and encodes the protein prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP). The gene is located on chromosome 12q21.2 and plays a role in the regulation of the release of prolactin.

## Gene Function
PRLH stimulates the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland, which plays a role in lactation, reproduction, and immune system regulation.
