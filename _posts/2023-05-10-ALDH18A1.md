# Gene: ALDH18A1

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location:
- Chromosome: 10
- Start Probe Location:  antecedent to  34,742,103
- End Probe Location: posterior to 34,820,123

## Pathology:
ALDH18A1 gene is involved in the biosynthesis of proline, which is essential for collagen production and connective tissue formation in the body. Mutations in this gene result in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-dependent seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay.

## Function:
The ALDH18A1 gene encodes the enzyme Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), which is responsible for the conversion of glutamate to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), a precursor of proline. 

## External IDs and Aliases:
- Gene ID: 80062
- HGNC: 24986
- Ensembl: ENSG00000107521
- OMIM: 138250
- Alias: AASDH, P5CS, PYCS, P5C synthase

## AA Mutation List and Mutation type:

| AA Change | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
