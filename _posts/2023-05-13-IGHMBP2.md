## Gene: IGHMBP2

### Gene Information
- Function: IGHMBP2 encodes a helicase protein that is involved in RNA metabolism and implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a neurodegenerative disorder. 
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 5144
    - NCBI Entrez: 3508
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000131620
    - OMIM: 600502
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6I6
- Genomic location: Chromosome 11q13.3

### Mutations
- AA mutation list: A list of non-synonymous variants for the IGHMBP2 gene can be found on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot website.
- Mutation types: Missense, frameshift, nonsense.
- dbSNP IDs: rs137852504, rs137852505, rs137852506, rs137852507

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP IDs: rs2465908, rs121908645, rs558897861, rs121908644

### Related disease
- Multiple system atrophy (MSA)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for MSA. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms such as medication for postural hypotension, bladder problems, constipation, and Parkinsonism. Prognosis varies and is generally poor, with most people with MSA succumbing to the disease within 7-10 years after symptom onset.

### Drug response
- There is no known drug response for MSA.
