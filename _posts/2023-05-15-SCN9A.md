## Gene SCN9A 

- **Function:** The SCN9A gene encodes for the alpha-subunit of the Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel, which plays a crucial role in pain perception and nociception. 

- **External IDs and Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 10587
    - NCBI Entrez: 6335
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000141510
    - OMIM: 603415
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15858
    
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Arg1150Pro - missense mutation - rs114558756
    - p.Ser459Phe - missense mutation - rs199710678

    - c.476C>A - missense mutation - rs1057519381
    
- **Related disease:** Mutations in SCN9A have been linked to various pain disorders, including Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and small fiber neuropathy (SFN). 

- **Treatment and prognosis:** There are currently no approved treatments for pain disorders caused by SCN9A mutations. Treatment focuses on symptom management and may include the use of analgesics, neuromodulatory agents, and physical therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

- **Drug response:** Research suggests that Nav1.7 inhibitors, such as dexpramipexole, PF-05089771, and TV-45070, may be effective in treating pain disorders caused by SCN9A mutations.
