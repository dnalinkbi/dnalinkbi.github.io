# Information about gene SIX6

## Genetic Position

SIX6 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14 at the position 14q23.1.

## Pathology

Mutations in the SIX6 gene have been associated with various ocular diseases including primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and myopia. 

## Function

SIX6 gene codes for a homeobox transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the eye, particularly in the formation of the optic cup and the lens.

- p.Ile170Val, missense, rs146943277

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic mutations in the SIX6 gene.

## Related disease

- Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)
- Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH)
- Myopia

## Treatment and prognosis

There is currently no cure for primary open angle glaucoma. Treatment is focused on reducing the intraocular pressure through medication, laser or surgery. The prognosis for POAG varies and it is largely dependent on the severity of the disease and how well it responds to treatment.

There is no cure for optic nerve hypoplasia, and treatment is symptomatic. The prognosis is variable and depends on the severity of the optic nerve damage.

## Drug response

There is currently no known drug specifically targeting SIX6 gene mutations.
