# Information about Gene PIK3R5

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
Gene PIK3R5 is located on chromosome 17 at the position 17p13.3. It is associated with cancer and immune system disorders. The PIK3R5 gene encodes for a protein called phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 5. This protein is involved in the regulation of cell signaling pathways, especially those associated with the immune system. It is also involved in the regulation of cell survival, growth, and proliferation.

## Function of Gene
The PIK3R5 gene encodes a protein that is a regulatory subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. This complex is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, as well as intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking.

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the PIK3R5 gene are associated with various diseases including:
- Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID)
- Hypogammaglobulinemia
- Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)
- Cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is limited information available regarding the treatment and prognosis for individuals with mutations in the PIK3R5 gene. However, studies suggest that targeting the PI3K signaling pathway may be a promising approach for cancer treatment in patients with mutations in PIK3R5.

## Drug Response
Studies show that drugs targeting the PI3K signaling pathway can effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells with mutations in PIK3R5.
