# Gene GRIN2B

## Information
- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 12q13.13
- **Pathology**: Mutations in GRIN2B gene are associated with various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.
- **Function**: Encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory formation.

## External IDs
- **Gene ID**: 2904
- **Genomic location**: NC_000012.12 (56506483..57270773)
- **Aliases**: NMDAR2B, GluN2B

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for diseases caused by GRIN2B mutations. Treatment is mainly focused on managing symptoms and providing support to patients and their families.

## Drug Response
- GRIN2B mutations have been identified as potential targets for drug development. Several drugs targeting NMDA receptors, including amantadine and memantine, have been used to treat related disorders with some success.
