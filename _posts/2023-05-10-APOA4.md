# Gene APOA4

- **Function**: The APOA4 gene encodes apolipoprotein A-IV, a protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that plays a role in the metabolism of lipids and cholesterol in the body.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location**: 

  - HGNC ID: HGNC:608
  - NCBI Entrez ID: 337
  - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000150657
  - OMIM ID: 107730
  - Genomic Location: Chromosome 11q23.3 

  **Aliases:** APOAIV, ApoA-IV, AI, apoA-IV-1, apoA-IV-2

- **AA Mutation List**:

  - rs675: p.Gln360His
  - rs5082: p.Gln360His
  - rs6595: p.Lys171Thr
  - rs6754: p.Leu10Pro

  **Mutation Type**: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels**:

  - rs17856302
  - rs111986938
  - rs140267878
  - rs3764261
  
  **dbSNP ID**: rs17856302, rs111986938, rs140267878, rs3764261

- **Related Diseases**: Mutations in the APOA4 gene have been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and other cardiovascular disorders.

- **Treatment and Prognosis**: There is currently no targeted treatment for APOA4-related disorders. Treatment typically includes lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and exercise, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

- **Drug Response**: None reported yet.
