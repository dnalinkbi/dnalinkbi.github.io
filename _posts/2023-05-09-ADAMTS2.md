# Information about gene ADAMTS2

## Genetic position
- ADAMTS2 is located on chromosome 5 (5q35.3).

## Pathology
- ADAMTS2 is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC (EDS VIIC), a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Mutations in ADAMTS2 gene lead to deficiency or abnormality of the enzyme, which is involved in the processing of procollagens I, II, and III in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue.

## Function for gene
- ADAMTS2 encodes for a metalloproteinase enzyme, which is responsible for the processing and cleavage of various extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen type I, II and III. It is involved in the maintenance of connective tissue integrity.

## External IDs, Aliases, and Genomic Location
- External IDs: HGNC: 236, NCBI Entrez Gene: 9509, Ensembl: ENSG00000113304, OMIM: 604539, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O95924
- Aliases: ADAM-TS2, ADAMTS-3, ADAMTS3B, PC6TS
- Genomic location: Chromosome 5: 35,044,258-35,135,239

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly1079Cys, missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs28929474)
- p.Gly1079Arg, missense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs104893832)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No known somatic variations have been reported in the ADAMTS2 gene.

## Related disease
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC (EDS VIIC), a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility due to mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene.

## Treatment and prognosis
- There is no cure for EDS VIIC, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may involve physical therapy, bracing, splinting, and wound care. Prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the specific mutations involved.

## Drug response
- There is currently no known drug specifically for the treatment of EDS VIIC, and drug response has not been extensively studied.
