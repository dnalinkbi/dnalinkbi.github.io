# Gene VSX2

## Genetic Position and Function
- Gene VSX2 is located on chromosome 14q24.3 and codes for a homeobox protein called visual system homeobox 2.
- It plays a critical role in the development and function of the vertebrate eye, including the retina and optic nerve.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 12872
- NCBI Entrez: 338917
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100616
- OMIM: 604273
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P58304
- Aliases: CHX10, VSX2.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- Some of the amino acid (AA) mutations associated with VSX2 gene are: R33W, R109W, A126D, H139D, and P167S.
- The mutation type is often missense.
- Some dbSNP IDs for these mutations are: rs61751512, rs61751513, rs786200871.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs associated with VSX2 gene.
- Some of them are rs148895970, rs201523581, rs149368764, and rs147387901.

## Related Disease
- Mutations in VSX2 gene are linked to inherited eye disorders, such as microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma.
- Additionally, mutations in this gene have been found in patients with other ocular diseases like cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, and glaucoma.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- The treatment for inherited eye disorders caused by mutations in VSX2 gene is often symptomatic and supportive, as there is currently no cure for these disorders.
- The prognosis depends on the severity and type of disorder associated with the gene mutation.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no drug treatment specifically designed for inherited eye disorders caused by mutations in VSX2 gene.
