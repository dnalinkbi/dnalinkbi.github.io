# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene TAAR1

## Gene Information
- **Function for gene:** TAAR1 (Trace amine-associated receptor 1) gene encodes for a G protein-coupled receptor that monitors the levels of trace amines in the brain.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases:** 
    - Gene ID: 134864 (NCBI Entrez)
    - HGNC ID: 16003 (HGNC)
    - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000198310
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 6 (NC_000006.12) 6q23.2
    - Aliases: TA1, TAR1, trace amine receptor 1

## Genetic Variations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several variations in the TAAR1 gene, few of which are mentioned below
    - L25F (rs8192618)
    - V98I (rs9689589)
    - L211F (rs1063690)
    - P240L (rs8192615)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There is not much evidence available regarding somatic mutations in TAAR1 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Genetic variations in the TAAR1 gene have been linked with various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction, etc.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Various drugs that target TAAR1 have been developed for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, more research is required to determine the efficacy and safety of these drugs.
- The prognosis of patients with genetic variations in TAAR1 gene varies depending on the specific variation and associated disease.

## Drug Response
- Experimental studies have shown that drugs targeting TAAR1 receptor have potential therapeutic effects on psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction, etc.
- A study conducted by Xie et al. showed that cariprazine, a TAAR1 agonist, improved symptoms of schizophrenia in clinical trials.
