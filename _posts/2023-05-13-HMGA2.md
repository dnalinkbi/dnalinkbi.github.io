# Gene Information for HMGA2

## Gene Function

HMGA2 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the High Mobility Group A (HMGA) family. The protein is a transcription factor that interacts with DNA sequences and regulates gene expression. HMGA2 is involved in various cellular processes such as embryonic development, cell growth, and differentiation.
