# Gene Information for TSLP

## Genetic Position, Pathology and Function

- **Genetic Position:** TSLP gene is located on chromosome 5q22.1 in humans.

- **Pathology:** TSLP gene has been associated with several diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.

- **Function:** TSLP (Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin) plays an important role in the regulation of immune system, especially in dendritic cells. It is a cytokine that triggers the production of T-helper-2 (Th2) cells and induces inflammatory responses in various tissues.

## Gene and Genomic Location

- **External IDs:** 
    - Gene ID: 85480
    - Genomic Location: NC_000005.10
    - Aliases: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin, thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin, ZNF ligand 1, ZNF ligand 1, CRLF2 partners with JAK2 

- **External Sites:**
    - HGNC: 11862
    - NCBI Entrez: 85480
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000147133
    - OMIM: 607601
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q969D9

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels identified in TSLP gene in various cancers, some of which are:

|SNV/Indel|dbSNP ID|Cancer Type|
|-|-|-|
|chr5:100804926G>T|rs397507279|Lung Adenocarcinoma|
|chr5:100802247T>C|rs398123551|Gastric Cancer|
|chr5:100805111C>A|rs778879744|Glioblastoma|

## Related Disease

TSLP gene is associated with several diseases including:

- Asthma
- Allergic rhinitis
- Atopic dermatitis
- Eczema
- Other allergic and inflammatory disorders

## Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment options depend on the underlying disease and severity of symptoms. Some treatments include antihistamines, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic therapy.

Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and response to treatment. In some cases, the disease can be managed effectively with treatment.

## Drug Response

Studies have shown that anti-TSLP monoclonal antibodies can effectively reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function in patients with severe asthma.
