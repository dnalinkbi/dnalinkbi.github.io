# Genetic Information Analysis for Gene SFTPA2

## Gene Overview
- **Function:** This gene encodes a lung surfactant protein that plays a critical role in the immune response to inhaled microorganisms and antigens. Additionally, it helps to maintain the structural integrity of the surfactant monolayer within the alveoli of the lung.
- **External IDs:** SFTPA2 is located on chromosome 10, and its genomic location is 10q22.3. Its aliases include: PSP-A, SFTP2, SFTPD2, and SP-D2.
- **External Sites:** 
  - HGNC: 10703 
  - NCBI Entrez: 729238 
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000188308
  - OMIM: 178640 
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8IWL2

## Mutations and Variations
- **AA Mutation List:** According to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, there are several missense mutations that have been identified in the SFTPA2 gene, including: 
  - p.Arg219Cys (rs121909038)
  - p.Ala91Thr (rs150811299)
  - p.Arg249Cys (rs121909040)
- **Mutation Type:** Missense mutations
- **dbSNP ID:** rs121909038, rs150811299, rs121909040
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels:** No somatic variants have been reported for this gene in the COSMIC database.

## Related Diseases
- SFTPA2 mutations have been linked to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for these respiratory disorders are limited, with lung transplantation being the only curative therapy for IPF.
- The prognosis for patients with SFTPA2 mutations varies depending on the severity of the respiratory disorder.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug response specifically for SFTPA2 mutations.
