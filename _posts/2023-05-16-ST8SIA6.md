## Gene ST8SIA6

### Genetic Position
The gene ST8SIA6 is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q24.2).

### Pathology
ST8SIA6 gene has been associated with various diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

### Function
The ST8SIA6 gene encodes a sialyltransferase enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of sialic acid from cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) to glycan structures on glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins.
