# Information about gene ITGB1

## Genetic Position
ITGB1 is located on chromosome 10q24.32.

## Pathology
Mutations in this gene have been associated with various pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammatory disorders.

## Function for gene
ITGB1 encodes for the integrin beta-1 subunit, which is a transmembrane protein that acts as a heterodimeric receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. Integrins play a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in ITGB1, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Some of the examples of mutations are:

- rs143767587 (p.Asp723Gly)
- rs121912581 (p.Arg740Trp)
- rs587779456 (p.Ile711Thr)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic mutations in ITGB1 have been reported in various cancer types, including breast cancer, melanoma, and lung cancer. Some of the examples of somatic mutations are:

- rs147597253 (p.Glu233Lys)
- rs483352811 (p.Pro135Ser)

## Related diseases
- Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome (LAD)
- Pyloric Stenosis, Infantile Hypertrophic
- Spastic Paraplegia 3, Autosomal Dominant

## Treatment and prognosis
The treatment and prognosis may vary depending on the underlying disease and severity of the condition. In some cases, surgery, medication, or stem cell transplantation may be necessary.

## Drug response
There is evidence that ITGB1 can be a potential therapeutic target for various diseases, including cancer. Several drugs that target ITGB1 are currently in clinical trials.
