# Information about gene CEBPA-AS1

## Genetic Position
CEBPA-AS1 is located on chromosome 19q13.12.

## Pathology
Studies suggest that CEBPA-AS1 plays a role in leukemogenesis. Specifically, it has been found to have an impact on the functionality of CEBPA, a transcription factor that regulates differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Alterations in CEBPA-AS1 expression have been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). 

## Function
CEBPA-AS1 is a long non-coding RNA that plays a regulatory role in the expression of the transcription factor CEBPA.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
No AA mutation list or mutation type has been reported for CEBPA-AS1.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID have been reported for CEBPA-AS1.

## Related disease
CEBPA-AS1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

## Treatment and prognosis
The aberrant expression of CEBPA-AS1 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemias. Further research is needed to establish the therapeutic potential of targeting CEBPA-AS1 in leukemia.

## Drug response
No drugs have been identified as specifically targeting CEBPA-AS1.
