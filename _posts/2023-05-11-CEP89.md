## Gene: CEP89

### Pathology and Function
CEP89 (Centrosomal protein 89) is a protein-coding gene involved in the formation of cilia and flagella in cells. It is associated with the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder that affects the motility of cilia and flagella, causing respiratory problems, situs inversus, and infertility. CEP89 plays a critical role in the assembly of cilia and flagella by regulating the microtubule organization and basal body docking.

### Gene Identification
- External IDs: HGNC:29906, NCBI Entrez: 140578, Ensembl: ENSG00000171066, OMIM: 617029, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8N157
- Genomic location: Chromosome 9 (9q31.1)

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gln265Lys (rs150636768): Missense mutation, where glutamine (Gln) is replaced by lysine (Lys) at position 265 of the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported in CEP89.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in CEP89 are associated with the following diseases:
- Primary ciliary dyskinesia
- Situs inversus
- Infertility

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no definitive cure for primary ciliary dyskinesia, and treatment aims to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and type of symptoms.

### Drug Response
