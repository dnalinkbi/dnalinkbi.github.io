## Gene: DGKD

DGKD (diacylglycerol kinase delta) is a gene located on chromosome 2 (2p25.1) and encodes for a protein that is involved in regulating intracellular signaling pathways by modulating the balance of second messenger diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid levels. It is primarily expressed in the brain, heart, and adipose tissue.

### Function
DGKD plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways, including those involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Its function is mainly regulated by the diacylglycerol (DAG) levels, which play important physiological roles in modulating cellular responses.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels associated with DGKD have been reported yet.

### Related Disease
DGKD mutations have been linked to several diseases, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obesity, and hypertension. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified DGKD as a susceptibility locus for stroke and myocardial infarction.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there are no specific treatments available for DGKD-related disorders. However, targeting the intracellular signaling pathways modulated by DGKD may hold therapeutic potential for these conditions. The prognosis of DGKD-related diseases depends on the severity of the symptoms and the course of the disease.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response in DGKD-related disorders. However, some studies suggest that certain drugs, such as valproic acid, may influence DGKD activity and affect disease outcomes.
