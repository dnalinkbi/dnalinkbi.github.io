## Gene SGCD
- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 5: 23,164,772-23,182,071
- **Pathology:** SGCD gene mutations are associated with the development of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F (LGMD2F) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
- **Function for Gene:** The SGCD gene encodes delta-sarcoglycan, a member of the sarcoglycan complex that is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of muscle fibers. It is involved in muscle contraction, cell adhesion, and signal transduction pathways.
- **Aliases:** DMDA3, LGMD2F, MFM6, SGCA4, delta-SG
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 10827
    - NCBI Entrez: 6449
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000134757
    - OMIM: 601411
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13424
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Trp21Ter (rs61747034)

    - p.Ser77Pro (rs41516354)
    - p.Ser141Arg (rs61733749)
    - p.Arg156Ter (rs61749986)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

    - c.1102G>A (rs1057520074)
    - c.1205C>T (rs41516353)
    - c.1279A>G (rs61733748)
    - c.1374G>A (rs61733747)
- **Related Disease:** Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F (LGMD2F), Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** There is no cure for LGMD2F, and treatment primarily focuses on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. Physical therapy, leg braces, and ventilator support may be useful. Medications such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have been tried but have shown limited efficacy. The prognosis varies and depends on the severity and progression of the disease.
- **Drug Response:** There is no definitive information on drug response, but some studies suggest that treatments such as steroids and ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in some patients.
