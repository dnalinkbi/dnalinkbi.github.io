# Gene: FMR1

## Genetic Position
The FMR1 gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq27.3.

## Pathology
The expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene promoter region results in the hypermethylation and subsequent gene silencing, leading to fragile X syndrome (FXS). CGG repeat expansions in the intermediate range (45-54 repeats) are associated with an increased risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and an intermediate form of the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 

## Function
The FMR1 gene encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which regulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in synaptic plasticity and axonal extension.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No commonly occurring pathogenic amino acid substitutions have been identified in the FMR1 gene.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No commonly occurring somatic SNVs/InDels have been identified in the FMR1 gene.

## Related Disease
Fragile X syndrome (FXS)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for FXS. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and may include educational and behavioral interventions, medications to manage ADHD and anxiety, and physical or occupational therapy. The prognosis for individuals with FXS varies, but early intervention and treatment can improve outcomes.

## Drug Response
Research on the effectiveness of medications for FXS is ongoing. Some medications, such as SSRIs and antipsychotics, may be used to manage symptoms of mood or behavioral disorders.
