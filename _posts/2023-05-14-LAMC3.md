## Information about gene LAMC3
LAMC3 (Laminin Subunit Gamma 3) is a gene that codes for a protein member of the laminin protein family. This protein is a component of the extracellular matrix, which is a network of proteins and molecules that provides support and structure to cells. LAMC3 is involved in cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation. 

### Function for gene
LAMC3 is involved in cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are various aa mutations with dbSNP IDs in the LAMC3 gene. However, further analysis is needed for each mutation to determine its functional significance.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are various somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs in the LAMC3 gene. However, further analysis is needed for each variant to determine its functional significance.

### Related disease
Mutations in LAMC3 have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive condition known as nodular basement membrane-like-epidermolysis bullosa simplex (NOB). This condition is characterized by fragility of the skin, blistering and erosion of the skin and mucous membranes upon minor trauma, and thickening and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles.

### Treatment and prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for NOB. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include wound care, topical antibiotics, and pain management. The prognosis for individuals with NOB varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset.

### Drug response
There is limited information about drug response in individuals with NOB. More research is needed in this area to determine the effectiveness of different treatments.
