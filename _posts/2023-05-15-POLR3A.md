# Gene Information for POLR3A

## Genetic Position
- POLR3A is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22.1).
- The gene spans a region of approximately 92.5 kilobases.

## Pathology
- Pathogenic variants in the POLR3A gene have been linked to several autosomal recessive disorders of the nervous system, including:
    - Leukodystrophy with hypomyelination and hypodontia.
    - Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity.
- Variants in this gene have also been associated with a shorter lifespan in some populations.

## Function
- POLR3A is a subunit of RNA polymerase III, an enzyme involved in the transcription of DNA to produce RNA.
- Specifically, it is responsible for transcribing small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and some transfer RNAs (tRNAs).

## External IDs
- HGNC: 9198
- NCBI Entrez: 10723
- Ensembl: ENSG00000120067
- OMIM: 614258
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O14802

## AA mutation list
- Some POLR3A missense variants associated with genetic disorders include:
    - p.Asp757Asn
        - rs757271981
    - p.Pro891Leu
        - rs767277483
    - p.Arg1038His
        - rs267607283
    - p.Arg1038Cys
        - rs202201325

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- Currently, there are no known reports of somatic SNVs/InDels in POLR3A.

## Related Disease
- Variants in POLR3A have been associated with the following diseases:
    - Leukodystrophy with hypomyelination and hypodontia.
        - This disease is characterized by abnormal development of myelin in the nervous system and the absence of some teeth.
    - Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity.
        - This disease is characterized by abnormal formation of myelin in certain parts of the nervous system.
- Rare variants in this gene have also been associated with early mortality in some populations.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for POLR3A-related disorders is typically supportive and symptomatic.
- Prognosis varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no information on drug response in individuals with POLR3A variants.
