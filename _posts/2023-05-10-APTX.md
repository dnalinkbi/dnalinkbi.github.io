# Gene Information
## Gene: APTX
### Function
APTX (aprataxin) is a protein-coding gene that plays a role in DNA repair and maintenance. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 5'-AMP group from DNA strand breaks generated by oxidative damage or topoisomerase inhibitors, thereby preparing the DNA for ligation by DNA Ligase III. Its deficiency may result in accumulation of DNA strand breaks, leading to cerebellar ataxia and ocular motor apraxia.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic variants reported in dbSNP for APTX gene.

### Related Disease
Deficiency of the APTX gene may lead to two autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders - Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 1 (AOA1) and Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). Both disorders are characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and oculomotor apraxia, and may also cause choreiform movements, dystonia, and peripheral neuropathy.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure or specific treatment available for AOA1 and AOA2. Treatment is primarily supportive and aimed at reducing symptoms or delaying their progression. For AOA1 patients, antioxidant compounds such as coenzyme Q10, vitamin E and idebenone have been found to be helpful. There is limited information on the prognosis of these diseases, as it can vary depending on the severity of symptoms and disease progression.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on drug response related to APTX gene.
