## Gene Information: CHKB

### Genetic Position
The CHKB gene is located on the human chromosome 22q13.33 in genomic position NC_000022.11.

### Pathology
Mutations in the CHKB gene have been associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital, Megaconial Type. This disorder primarily affects the skeletal muscles, causing muscle weakness and wasting.

### Function
The CHKB gene encodes for the enzyme choline kinase beta, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, an important component of cell membranes.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
Several missense mutations have been identified in the CHKB gene, which result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the choline kinase beta enzyme. These include:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L7R | Missense | rs80356564 |
| A194V | Missense | rs121908593 |
| A218T | Missense | rs755129666 |
| G240R | Missense | rs121908594 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the CHKB gene.

### Related Disease
Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital, Megaconial Type is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CHKB gene. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, and is typically diagnosed during infancy or early childhood.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital, Megaconial Type. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life for affected individuals.

### Drug Response
There is limited information available on the drug response of Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital, Megaconial Type.
