# Analysis of Gene DNASE1L3

## General Information
**Gene Name:** DNASE1L3

**Aliases:** DNASE1L2, DNASEX

**Chromosome Location:** Chromosome 3 (3q27.1)

**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 3002
- NCBI Entrez: 1774
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137857
- OMIM: 603165
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q14194

## Function
The DNASE1L3 gene encodes for the deoxyribonuclease 1-like 3 enzyme, which is a member of the deoxyribonuclease I family. The protein has endonuclease activity and catalyzes the hydrolysis of DNA to form 5'-phosphodinucleotide and 5'-phosphooligonucleotide end-products. It plays a crucial role in removing the DNA fragments formed during apoptosis and preventing the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

## Mutations
### AA Mutation List with dbSNP ID
| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|------|---------|
| p.Gly142Ser | Missense | rs41426744 |
| p.Thr181Asn | Missense | rs2229080 |
| p.Asp303Asn | Missense | - |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Currently, there are no reported somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Studies have shown that DNASE1L3 mutations can lead to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is an autoimmune disorder. Genome-wide association analysis using a case-control approach has identified the DNASE1L3 variant rs35677470 as a potential SLE susceptibility locus in populations of European ancestry.

## Treatment and Prognosis
At this time, there are no specific treatments for DNASE1L3 mutations. Treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus may involve immunosuppressive drugs and lifestyle adjustments to minimize the risk of further complications. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. 

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug response information available for DNASE1L3 mutations or related diseases.
