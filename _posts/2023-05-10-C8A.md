# Gene: C8A

## General Information

The C8A gene is located on chromosome 1q21, spanning a genomic region from 151,934,037 to 151,969,199 (GRCh38.p13). It is also known by the aliases C8, C8G, and CO8A.

## Function

The C8A gene encodes for complement component 8 alpha (C8α), a protein that is part of the complement system, which plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity. C8α, along with other components of the complement system, forms the membrane attack complex (MAC) that aids in the lysis of foreign cells and pathogens.

## Mutations

### AA Mutation List

There are several amino acid (AA) mutations reported for the C8A gene in the dbSNP database. Some examples include:

- p.Ala5Thr (rs373457835)
- p.Gly113Cys (rs144592702)
- p.Arg144Trp (rs769157402)
- p.Ala285Thr (rs369117331)

### Mutation Type and dbSNP ID

The mutations reported in the C8A gene are mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and their dbSNP IDs are provided above.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

There is no reported information about somatic SNVs/InDels in the C8A gene.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the C8A gene have been associated with complement component 8 deficiency (C8D), a rare autosomal recessive disease that affects the complement system's ability to fight off bacterial infections. C8D patients often experience recurrent infections, especially meningococcal infections.

## Treatment and Prognosis

At present, there is no known cure for complement component 8 deficiency. However, patients are provided with supportive measures to prevent and manage infections. Prognosis largely depends on the timing and severity of infections experienced by patients.

## Drug Response

There are no known drugs that directly target the C8A gene or the complement system. However, patients with complement component deficiency may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics and vaccinations to prevent infections.
