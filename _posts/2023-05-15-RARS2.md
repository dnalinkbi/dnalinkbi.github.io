## Gene Information

The gene RARS2 is located on chromosome 6 at the genomic position 6q16.1. The gene is also known by aliases such as Mitochondrial RARS2, RARSL, MTDPS8, PCH6B, and DFNB87. The function of this gene is to encode the mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase, which is an essential enzyme in protein synthesis.
