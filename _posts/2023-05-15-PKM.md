# Information about Gene PKM

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function 

- **Genetic Position:** PKM gene is located on chromosome 15q13.1, spanning 52.5 kb of genomic DNA consisting of 12 exons. 

- **Pathology:** The PKM gene has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders.

- **Function:** The PKM gene encodes for pyruvate kinase, which is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, generating ATP in the process. PKM exists in two isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2, which differ in their enzymatic activity and tissue distribution.

## Additional Gene Information

- **Function for gene:** Catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, generating ATP and pyruvate.
