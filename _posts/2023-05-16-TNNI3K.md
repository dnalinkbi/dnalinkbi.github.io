## Gene: TNNI3K

### Genetic Position
- Chromosomal Location: 1q32.1
- Genomic coordinates: NC_000001.11:g.201042474G>A
- Transcript: NM_001080433.2
- Protein: NP_001073902.1

### Pathology and Function
- TNNI3K gene encodes for a protein kinase that is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. It plays a critical role in the regulation of cardiac function, including cardiomyocyte contraction, relaxation, and hypertrophy. 
- Mutations in the TNNI3K gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), an inherited cardiac disorder characterized by decreased contractility and dilation of the heart chambers, eventually leading to heart failure.

### Related Disease
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Current treatment options for DCM include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics, which aim to reduce symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
- The prognosis for DCM varies depending on the individual's age, severity of the condition, and response to treatment. Some cases may progress quickly to heart failure, while others may remain stable for years.

### Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response specific to TNNI3K mutations.
