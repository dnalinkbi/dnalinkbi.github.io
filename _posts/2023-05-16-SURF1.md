## Gene Information

### Gene: SURF1
The SURF1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the electron transport chain of the mitochondria.

### Gene Function
The protein produced from the SURF1 gene plays a crucial role in the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in the mitochondria. Specifically, it is involved in attaching copper ions to one of the subunits of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) of the OXPHOS chain.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in the SURF1 gene have been linked to Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that typically presents in children. Leigh syndrome is a progressive disease that affects many areas of the nervous system, often leading to vision loss, weakness, and difficulty with movement and breathing.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for Leigh syndrome. Treatment is typically focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care to affected individuals.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug treatment for Leigh syndrome. However, some medications, such as thiamine and coenzyme Q10, have been used in an attempt to slow down the progression of the disease.
