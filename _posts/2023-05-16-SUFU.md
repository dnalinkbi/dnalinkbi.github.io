# Gene SUFU

## Genetic Position
SUFU gene is located on chromosome 10 (10q24.32).

## Pathology
Mutations in the SUFU gene are associated with several cancer types including medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma and sporadic desmoplastic medulloblastoma. 

## Function
SUFU functions as a negative regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway by interacting with GLI transcription factors and preventing them from activating downstream genes.

- Medulloblastoma
- Basal Cell Carcinoma
- sporadic desmoplastic medulloblastoma

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no targeted treatment available for SUFU gene mutations, but treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are recommended. The prognosis depends on the cancer type, stage, and response to treatments.

## Drug Response
There is limited information regarding the drug response to SUFU gene mutations.
