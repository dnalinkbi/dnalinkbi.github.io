## Gene: FADD

### Information

- **Function for gene**: The FADD gene encodes a protein called Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD), which plays a critical role in programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis. It is involved in the activation of caspases, which are protease enzymes that initiate apoptosis.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: The FADD gene is located on chromosome 11 at position 11q13.3. It has the following aliases: MORT1, GIG3, and GIG5.

- **External sites**: The following external sites provide more information on the FADD gene: 
  - HGNC: 3546
  - NCBI Entrez: 8772
  - Ensembl: ENSG00000068078
  - OMIM: 603507
  - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13158

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: There are several AA mutations in the FADD gene that have been identified. Here is a list of some of them along with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:
  - Cys194Tyr, missense variant, rs761152418
  - Glu208Gln, missense variant, rs745726851
  - Trp209Cys, missense variant, rs143204156
  - Arg234Trp, missense variant, rs766217874
  - His251Arg, missense variant, rs764711998

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are somatic SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variations) and InDels (Insertions or Deletions) in the FADD gene that have been identified. Here are some of them along with their dbSNP ID:
  - rs186990968
  - rs56171732
  - rs1420481

- **Related disease**: The FADD gene is associated with several diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. Mutations in the FADD gene have been linked to the development of various types of cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is no specific treatment for mutations in the FADD gene. However, some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can induce apoptosis in cancer cells by activating caspases. The prognosis for individuals with FADD mutations varies depending on the severity of their condition and the type of cancer associated with the mutation.

- **Drug response**: Several drugs have been developed that target apoptosis by activating caspases, which can be beneficial for individuals with FADD mutations. However, the effectiveness of these drugs can vary depending on the specific mutation and the type of cancer involved.
