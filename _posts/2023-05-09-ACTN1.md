# Gene: ACTN1

## Genomic Location and Alias
- Chromosome: 14
- Gene ID: 87
- Gene Symbol: ACTN1
- Aliases: ACTN, FSGS2 

## Function 
The ACTN1 gene encodes a protein called Alpha-actinin-1 which is involved in crosslinking actin filaments in striated muscle and anchoring actin to a variety of cell membranes.
