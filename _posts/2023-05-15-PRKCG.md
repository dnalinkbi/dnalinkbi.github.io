# Gene Name: PRKCG

## General Information
- PRKCG stands for protein kinase C gamma.
- It is located on chromosome 19q13.2.
- It has 20 exons and spans approximately 37.2 kb on the genomic scale.

## Function
- PRKCG is a member of the protein kinase C family of serine/threonine kinases. It is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, inflammation, and cancer.
- PRKCG plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of ion channels, receptors, and other signaling proteins involved in the regulation of neuronal function and survival.
