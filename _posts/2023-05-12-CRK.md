# Gene: CRK

## Information
- **Position:** 17q23.3
- **Function:** CRK encodes for adaptor proteins that are involved in signal transduction pathways. These pathways are necessary for cell survival, growth, differentiation, and migration.
- **Aliases:** CRKL, p38
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 2362
    - NCBI Entrez: 1398
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000171094
    - OMIM: 602748
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P46108
