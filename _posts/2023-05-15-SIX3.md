## Gene SIX3 Information

### Genetic Position
The SIX3 gene is located on chromosome 2q14.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the SIX3 gene have been associated with holoprosencephaly type 2, which is a developmental defect characterized by a failure of the forebrain to completely divide into two hemispheres during embryonic development. This can lead to several structural abnormalities of the brain and face.

### Function
The SIX3 gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in the early development of the eye and forebrain.
