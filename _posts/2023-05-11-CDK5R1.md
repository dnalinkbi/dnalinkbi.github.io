## Gene: CDK5R1

### Information

- **Genetic Position:** 17q12
- **Function:** The CDK5R1 gene encodes for a protein called p35, which is involved in the regulation of neuronal migration and spine formation in the brain.
- **Aliases:** Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1, CDK5 activator 1, CDK5R
- **External IDs:**
    - HGNC: 1785
    - NCBI Entrez: 8851
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000132639
    - OMIM: 604593
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15078

### Mutations

- **AA Mutation List:**
    - p.Asp67Asn
    - p.Val97Leu
    - p.Thr138Arg
- **Mutation Type:** Missense
- **dbSNP ID:** rs62046946, rs180311319, rs121918374

### Somatic Mutations

- None reported

### Related Diseases

- **Lissencephaly:** There is evidence that mutations in CDK5R1 may contribute to lissencephaly, a rare neurological disorder characterized by a lack of folds or grooves in the brain.
- **Alzheimer's Disease:** Some studies suggest that p35 protein levels may be decreased in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, potentially contributing to the disease pathology.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for CDK5R1-related diseases at this time. The prognosis for individuals with lissencephaly or Alzheimer's disease varies depending on the severity of the condition.

### Drug Response

There is currently no information on drug response specific to CDK5R1-related diseases.
