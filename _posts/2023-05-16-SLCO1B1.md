# Gene: SLCO1B1

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 12
- Genomic Location: 21,782,578 - 21,818,919
- Strand: -
- Genome Assembly: GRCh38.p13

## Function
- SLCO1B1 encodes a solute carrier organic anion transporter protein.
- It mediates the uptake of various endogenous compounds and xenobiotics from the blood into hepatocytes.
- SLCO1B1 plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of drugs like statins, which are commonly used to treat hyperlipidemia.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic mutations reported yet.

## Related Disease
- SLCO1B1 variants are associated with altered pharmacokinetics and increased risk of toxicity for drugs like statins.
- Polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 have been linked to increased risk of statin-induced myopathy.
- Other associated diseases include hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Patients with SLCO1B1 variants are at an increased risk of developing statin-induced side effects.
- Regular monitoring of liver function and creatine kinase levels is recommended for patients on statin therapy.
- Dose adjustments or alternative treatments might be necessary for patients with SLCO1B1 variants to minimize the risks of adverse reactions.

## Drug Response
- SLCO1B1 variants have been shown to affect the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of drugs like statins, ezetimibe, and rifampin.
- Individuals with reduced transporter activity due to SLCO1B1 polymorphisms might require lower doses of these drugs to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.
- SLCO1B1 genotyping might help in personalized treatment and optimization of drug therapy.
