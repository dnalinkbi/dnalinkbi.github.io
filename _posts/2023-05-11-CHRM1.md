## Information about Gene CHRM1

### Genetic Position
- Gene: CHRM1
- Chromosome Number: 11
- Strand: -
- Start Position: 53,884,547
- End Position: 53,911,898

### Pathology and Function
- CHRM1 gene codes for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor.
- This receptor is widely distributed in the central nervous system and found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and basal forebrain.
- It plays a crucial role in cognitive and motor functions, including learning and memory, attention, and movement.
- Abnormal function or expression of the receptor is associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression.

### External IDs and Aliases
- Gene ID: 1128
- Genomic Location: NC_000011.10 (53884547..53911898)
- Aliases: M1R, CHRM1R, HM1, CHRM1R_HUMAN

### External Sites
- HGNC: HGNC:1941
- NCBI Entrez: 1128
- Ensembl: ENSG00000169048
- OMIM: 118494

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several AA mutations reported in the CHRM1 gene. Here are some examples:

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|------------|--------|
|P201L|missense|rs759035119|
|E418G|missense|rs1064796486|
|I94V|missense|rs759035120|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Several somatic SNVs and InDels are reported in the CHRM1 gene. Here are some examples:

|SNV/InDel|dbSNP ID|
|---------|--------|
|C>A|rs113488022|
|T>G|rs752977795|
|G>A|rs182392503|

### Related Disease
Abnormal function or expression of CHRM1 is associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including:
- Alzheimer's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Depression
- Substance use disorders
- Parkinson's disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil and rivastigmine are used to treat cognitive impairment and dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, which involves CHRM1 dysregulation.
- Antipsychotic medications like clozapine and quetiapine are used to treat psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia, which involves CHRM1 dysfunction.

### Drug Response
Variations in the CHRM1 gene may affect drug response and toxicity to medications such as:
- Atropine
- Scopolamine
- Pirenzepine
- Cevimeline
