## NF2 Gene 

The NF2 gene is located on chromosome 22 at the location 22q12.2. It produces a protein known as Merlin or Schwannomin, which is a tumor suppressor. The protein helps in regulating contact inhibition, differentiation, and proliferation. Mutations in the NF2 gene are responsible for the development of Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) and schwannomatosis.

### Function for gene
The NF2 gene encodes a protein called Merlin or Schwannomin, which is involved in cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. The protein acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the mitotic signaling pathway. It also plays an essential role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

### Related disease
The NF2 gene mutations have been associated with the following diseases:
- Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2)
- Schwannomatosis

### Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for NF2. Treatment aims to control the symptoms and address complications. Surgery, radiation therapy, and medications are the primary treatment options. The prognosis varies depending on the extent of complications and the age of onset.

### Drug response
Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has been reported to provide some clinical benefit in NF2 patients.
