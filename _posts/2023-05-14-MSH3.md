# Gene MSH3

## Information

### Genetic Position
The gene MSH3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 at position 5q11.2.

### Pathology
Mutations in the MSH3 gene are associated with a rare form of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. MSH3 gene mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

### Function
The MSH3 gene encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair. Specifically, it is a member of the MutS family of DNA repair proteins and works to repair mismatches in DNA replication.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 7323
- NCBI Entrez: 4437
- Ensembl: ENSG00000113141
- OMIM: 600887
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P36022
- Aliases: HNPCC5, DNA mismatch repair protein Msh3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the MSH3 gene that are associated with HNPCC. Some examples are:
- p.Ala18Asp, missense mutation, rs63750447
- p.Asp322Asn, missense mutation, rs63750086
- p.Arg354His, missense mutation, rs63750105
- p.Pro622Leu, missense mutation, rs63749921

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations in the MSH3 gene that have been identified in various cancers. Some examples are:
- c.888C>A, missense mutation, rs1057519260
- c.1048G>A, missense mutation, rs3835730
- c.1136C>T, missense mutation, rs724159865

### Related Disease
Mutations in the MSH3 gene are associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by an increased risk for colon, endometrial, and other types of cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Individuals with Lynch syndrome are advised to undergo regular cancer screenings. Treatment options vary depending on the specific cancer diagnosed.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug treatment for individuals with MSH3 mutations. Treatment options would depend on the specific cancer diagnosed.
