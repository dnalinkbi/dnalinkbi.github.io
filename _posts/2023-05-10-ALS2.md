# Information about Gene ALS2

## Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

**Gene Position:** ALS2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 33.2.

**Pathology:** Mutations in the ALS2 gene are known to cause a rare autosomal recessive form of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord.

**Function:** The ALS2 gene encodes the protein alsin, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance and function of motor neurons. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and vesicle transport through the interaction of its C-terminal region with small GTPases. The protein also participates in cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and synaptic plasticity.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

No significant somatic SNVs/InDels have been found with dbSNP ID associated with ALS2 gene.

## Related Disease

The pathogenic variations in the ALS2 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive form of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This neurodegenerative disorder impacts the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, causing a progressive loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there is no cure for ALS, and treatment is focused on symptom relief and slowing the progression of the disease. Some therapies may include medications, physical therapy, and respiratory support. The prognosis for individuals with ALS can vary, with an average life expectancy of two to five years from the onset of symptoms.

## Drug Response

There is no specific drug or therapy available that can successfully treat ALS as of now. However, medications like Riluzole and Edaravone are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ALS, which may improve the quality and length of life for some people with the disease.
