# Gene: MYO15A

## Genetic Position 
MYO15A is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at position 11.2.

## Pathology
Pathogenic mutations in MYO15A have been associated with autosomal recessive hearing loss, including severe-profound non-syndromic hearing loss and Usher syndrome type 1F.

## Function for Gene
MYO15A encodes a member of the myosin superfamily of actin-based motor proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the stereocilia bundles that mediate mechanotransduction in the inner ear hair cells, facilitating the conversion of sound waves into neural impulses.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is currently no known involvement of MYO15A in somatic mutations.

## Related Disease
MYO15A mutations have been associated with autosomal recessive hearing loss, including profound non-syndromic hearing loss and Usher syndrome type 1F, which is characterized by deafness and retinitis pigmentosa.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for hearing loss associated with MYO15A mutations, and treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms and providing hearing aids or cochlear implants as needed.

## Drug Response
There is currently no known drug that specifically targets MYO15A mutations associated with hearing loss.
