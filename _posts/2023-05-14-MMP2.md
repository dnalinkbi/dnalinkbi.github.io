## Gene MMP2

### Pathology

The gene MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase 2) is involved in several pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and arthritis. MMP2 cleaves extracellular matrix components, and its overexpression has been linked to tumor invasion and metastasis.

### Function

MMP2 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family that plays a key role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, morphogenesis, and tissue remodeling, as well as in pathological conditions. MMP2 is specifically involved in the degradation of type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane, and promotes angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue repair.

### Related Disease

MMP2 is associated with several diseases, including:

- Cancer: MMP2 overexpression has been found in many types of cancer, including lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer. MMP2 promotes angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion, and metastasis.
- Cardiovascular diseases: MMP2 plays a key role in atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases by degrading extracellular matrix components in the arterial wall.
- Arthritis: MMP2 contributes to cartilage and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis by cleaving collagen and other extracellular matrix components.

### Treatment and Prognosis

There are currently no targeted therapies for MMP2-related diseases. Treatment options for cancer typically involve surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In cardiovascular diseases, drugs that inhibit MMP2 activity have been tested in preclinical studies with promising results. The prognosis of MMP2-related diseases varies depending on the type and stage of the disease and the patient's overall health.

### Drug Response

Some compounds have been shown to inhibit MMP2 activity, including:

- Doxycycline: an antibiotic that also has anti-MMP2 activity
- Batimastat: a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor
- Marimastat: a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor
- ONO-4817: a selective MMP-2 inhibitor
