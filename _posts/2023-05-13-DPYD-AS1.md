# DPYD-AS1

DPYD-AS1 is a gene located on chromosome 1p21.3. It is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and its function is currently not well understood. 

## Function for gene

The function of DPYD-AS1 is currently unclear but it has been shown to be involved in regulating DPYD gene expression. DPYD is the gene encoding dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase which is important for the metabolism of the chemotherapy agent, 5-fluorouracil. 

## External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases

The external IDs for DPYD-AS1 are:
- HGNC: 28859
- NCBI Entrez: 100874540
- Ensembl: ENSG00000249780
- OMIM: NA
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: NA

Aliases: DPYD adjacent transcript 1

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

As DPYD-AS1 is a non-coding RNA, it does not have amino acid (AA) mutations.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are currently no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for DPYD-AS1 in dbSNP.

## Related disease

DPYD-AS1 has been linked to drug response and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. 

## Treatment and prognosis

Patients who have reduced DPYD activity are at higher risk of severe toxicity from 5-fluorouracil therapy. Studies have shown that DPYD-AS1 may be involved in regulating DPYD gene expression and may affect DPYD activity. Therefore, DPYD-AS1 may be a potential target for personalized chemotherapy dosing to reduce the risk of severe toxicity. 

## Drug response

The level of DPYD expression affects the efficacy and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Patients with reduced DPYD activity are at higher risk of toxicity.
