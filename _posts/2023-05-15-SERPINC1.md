## Gene: SERPINC1 

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 1
- Gene location: 1q25.1

### Pathology
- Mutations in the SERPINC1 gene are associated with Antithrombin III Deficiency, a disorder characterized by an increased risk of developing blood clots.

### Function
- The SERPINC1 gene provides instructions for making the antithrombin III protein, which plays a critical role in regulating blood clotting by inhibiting various blood-clotting factors.

### External IDs and Aliases
- External IDs: HGNC: 8694, NCBI Entrez: 462, Ensembl: ENSG00000141968, OMIM: 107300, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P01008
- Aliases: ATIII, AT3, SERPINC1

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Gly390Arg, Missense, rs121909719
- p.Arg425Cys, Missense, rs121909720

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not available

### Related Disease
- Antithrombin III Deficiency 

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for Antithrombin III Deficiency involves replacement therapy with antithrombin concentrates. The prognosis for this disorder varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the effectiveness of the treatment.

### Drug Response
- Antithrombin III concentrates are used in replacement therapy for this disorder.
