# Information on Gene B4GALT5

## Genetic Position

The gene B4GALT5 is located on chromosome 3q25.1, specifically at the coordinates 149,369,790-149,415,731 (GRCh38/hg38).

## Pathology

B4GALT5 encodes for a galactosyltransferase enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and other complex glycoconjugates. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several pathologies including:

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid form (EDS-PF)
- Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations (SEDCJD)
- Larsen syndrome

## Function

B4GALT5 encodes for a galactosyltransferase enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and other complex glycoconjugates.

Somatic SNVs and InDels in B4GALT5 are available in the dbSNP database. However, no specific somatic SNVs or InDels were found associated with cancer or other diseases.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in the B4GALT5 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid form (EDS-PF)
- Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations (SEDCJD)
- Larsen syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment or cure for these diseases. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive; for example, joint surgery may be required in patients with joint dislocations.

## Drug Response

There is currently no known drug that targets B4GALT5 directly for the treatment of these diseases.
