## Gene Information
**Gene**: Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9)\
**Aliases**: BMP-9, GDF-9B\
**Function**: Growth differentiation factor 9 is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that plays an important role in folliculogenesis and oogenesis.\
**Genomic location**: Chromosome 5q31.1

## AA Mutation list
No amino acid mutations have been reported for GDF9.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for GDF9.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the GDF9 gene have been associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is a condition characterized by the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for primary ovarian insufficiency. Treatment options include hormone replacement therapy and fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
There is currently no drug specifically targeting GDF9 mutations. However, hormone replacement therapy and other medications may be used to manage symptoms associated with primary ovarian insufficiency.
