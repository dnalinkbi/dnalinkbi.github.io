# Information about Gene DLX2

**Genetic Position**: The DLX2 gene is located on chromosome 2q32.1.

**Pathology**: The DLX2 gene is associated with various pathologies such as craniofacial anomalies, tooth agenesis, and non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

**Function**: The DLX2 gene encodes a homeobox protein that plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system and craniofacial structures.
