# MBTPS2 Gene Information

## Genetic Position
The MBTPS2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 at position q24.3.

## Pathology and Function
The MBTPS2 gene encodes the membrane-bound transcription factor protease, site 2 (MBTPS2). This protein is involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a variety of membrane-bound proteins. MBTPS2 also plays a role in cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs/InDels currently listed in the dbSNP database for the MBTPS2 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in MBTPS2 have been associated with several diseases, including:
- Ichthyosis follicularis with atrichia and photophobia syndrome (IFAP) 
- Olmsted syndrome
- Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for IFAP or Olmsted syndrome, but treatments are available to manage symptoms. Treatment options may include topical creams or ointments to soothe the skin or antibiotics to treat infections. The prognosis for individuals with these disorders can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms.

## Drug Response
No specific drug response information is currently listed for the MBTPS2 gene.
