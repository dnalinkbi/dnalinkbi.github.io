## Gene Information for INPP5B

### Genetic Position
Chromosome: 1

Location: 1q32.1
  ### Pathology 
INPP5B gene is associated with various cancers such as bladder, breast, colorectal and lung cancer. Studies have suggested that INPP5B acts as a tumor suppressor gene and its downregulation is associated with cancer progression and metastasis.

### Function
The INPP5B gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3, 4)P2) to their respective forms, PI, PI4P, and PI3P. These PIs are involved in various cellular functions, including signaling, vesicular trafficking, and cytoskeletal regulation.

### Related Disease
- Breast cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Lung cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
Studies have suggested that the INPP5B gene may be a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Its downregulation is associated with cancer progression and metastasis, and drugs targeting INPP5B could potentially prevent or slow the progression of these cancers.

### Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug that targets the INPP5B gene.
