## Information about Gene VRK1

### Genetic position, pathology, and function:

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 14, location q32.1.
- **Pathology:** VRK1's dysfunction has been linked to multiple diseases, including human cancer, adult-onset autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia, pontocerebellar hypoplasias, and autism spectrum disorders.
- **Function:** VRK1 (Vaccinia Related Kinase 1) is a member of the Casein Kinase I family, which plays a role in regulating important cellular processes such as DNA damage response, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and autophagy.

### Gene/Genomic Location, Aliases:

- **Gene ID:** 7443
- **Aliases:** VRK, AURA, AIK, VARK1
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 14 (NC_000014.9) : 91015743-91033170.

- A list of currently known VRK1 missense variants is available in the [dbSNP]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)) database. Examples include:
  - **p.Arg102Thr:** rs137853907
  - **p.Arg367His:** rs750759081
  - **p.Asn387Ser:** rs796052470
  - **p.Asn387Lys:** rs778200310
- These mutations are either substitutions or deletions that change the amino acid sequence of the protein.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:

- Somatic variants in VRK1 have been detected in various types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Examples of somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID that have been reported in these cancers include:
  - **p.Asn387Lys:** rs778200310 in lung adenocarcinoma
  - **p.Arg102Thr:** rs137853907 in ovarian carcinoma
  - **p.Val232_Gln239del:** rs1555581687 in hepatocellular carcinoma

### Related disease:

- VRK1 has been linked to multiple diseases as mentioned above.
