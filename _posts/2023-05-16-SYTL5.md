# Gene SYTL5

## Information
- Genomic location: Chromosome 11q13.1
- Gene ID: 203049
- Aliases: SYTL4, CPEB4
- HGNC: 28701
- NCBI Entrez: 203049
- Ensembl: ENSG00000137514
- OMIM: 611923
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H7B7

## Function
The SYTL5 gene encodes synaptotagmin-like protein 5, which is involved in the regulation of exocytic events in cell-to-cell communication processes, such as neurotransmitter release. It is also believed to play a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.

## Mutations
- AA mutation list: There are several missense and nonsense mutations identified in SYTL5 gene such as c.268C>G (p.Leu90Val), c.202A>G (p.Gln68Arg), c.1077T>C (p.Leu359Ser), c.1031C>T (p.Leu344Phe), c.334dupT (p.Leu112Phefs*5) and c.508C>T (p.Arg170Ter).
- Mutation type: Missense and nonsense mutations
- dbSNP ID: rs1397849403, rs765878791, rs755007074, rs201259596, rs886044684, rs146281066

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: rs1556573621, rs1556573618, rs745767498, rs768435788, rs784757100, rs772322250, rs758346729

## Related Disease
Currently, there are no known diseases directly associated with SYTL5 mutations. However, alterations in SYTL5 expression have been linked to various diseases, including type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no targeted treatment for SYTL5-related diseases. However, understanding the role of SYTL5 in these diseases may lead to the development of new therapies. Prognosis varies depending on the associated disease and the severity of the mutation.

## Drug response
There is currently no known drug response associated with SYTL5.
