## Information about gene DMXL2

### Genetic Position
The gene DMXL2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q23.1) and spans 338,304 base pairs.

### Pathology
Studies have linked mutations in the DMXL2 gene to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.

### Function
The DMXL2 gene encodes for a protein that is involved in neuronal migration and axon guidance during brain development. It is also involved in the maintenance and regulation of the dendritic spines of neurons.
