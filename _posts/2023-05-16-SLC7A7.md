## Gene: SLC7A7

- **Function for gene:** SLC7A7 encodes a protein member of a family of mainly cationic amino acid transporters that play a crucial role in amino acid metabolism.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location:** 
    - HGNC: 10950 
    - NCBI Entrez: 9056 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000066427 
    - OMIM: 603593 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y5K2 
    - Genomic location: 14q11.2

- **Aliases:** CAT2, y+LAT1, FLJ20289

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:**
    - p.Arg306Trp - rs137852766
    - p.Arg306Ter - rs137852767
    - p.Gly324Arg - rs121434270
    - p.Leu502_Pro503del - rs137852765
    - p.Ser550Arg - rs2066844
    
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.

- **Related disease:** SLC7A7 mutations are associated with lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), an autosomal recessive disease. Common symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, fatigue, and failure to thrive.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** Currently, there is no cure for LPI. Treatment involves dietary management, including a low-protein diet and supplementation with citrulline and arginine. With proper treatment, many people with LPI can have a good prognosis.

- **Drug response:** Studies have suggested that SLC7A7 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of cancer, as the protein is involved in the transport of amino acids required for tumor cell growth. However, more research is needed before developing such inhibitors.
