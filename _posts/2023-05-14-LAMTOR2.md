# Information about gene LAMTOR2

## Genetic Position
- Gene: LAMTOR2 (late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 2)
- Chromosome: 1
- Location: 1p32.1


## Pathology and Function
LAMTOR2 gene encodes a protein which functions as a subunit of the Ragulator complex. The Ragulator complex is responsible for recruiting Rag GTPases to lysosomes thereby facilitating the activation of MTORC1 and the subsequent downstream signaling cascade. Mutations in LAMTOR2 have been associated with skin pigmentation disorders, including oculocutaneous albinism type 7.

## Related Disease
- Oculocutaneous Albinism Type 7
    - Hypopigmentation of the skin, hair and eyes due to defects in melanin biosynthesis


## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for oculocutaneous albinism type 7. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications such as skin damage and vision problems.


## Drug Response
There is no current information available regarding drug response for LAMTOR2-associated disorders.
