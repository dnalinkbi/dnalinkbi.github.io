# Gene KEL

## General Information
- Gene: KEL
- Aliases: KELL, Kx, McLeod Syndrome Related Protein
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 7
- External IDs:
    - HGNC: 6318
    - NCBI Entrez:  kel
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000105968
    - OMIM: 314830
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P23276


## Function
The KEL gene encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein known as Kell blood group antigen. It is primarily expressed in erythroid cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of red blood cells.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
The dbSNP database lists a total of 1,283 variations in the KEL gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Some of the mutations with their dbSNP IDs are:

|Mutation Type|Amino Acid Change|dbSNP ID|
|-------------|----------------|--------|
|Missense|V48M|rs34541479|
|Missense|G245S|rs118203835|
|Missense|T257M|rs118203836|
|Nonsense|R423X|rs199476128|
|Frameshift|L483Ffs*7|rs202104985|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
The COSMIC database lists a few somatic mutations in the KEL gene. Some of the mutations with their dbSNP IDs are:

|Mutation Type|Amino Acid Change|dbSNP ID|
|-------------|----------------|--------|
|Missense|G245R|rs118203835|
|Missense|C500S|rs34193784|

## Related Diseases
Mutations in the KEL gene are associated with the following diseases:
- McLeod syndrome: A rare X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by muscular and neurologic symptoms, acanthocytosis, and elevated creatine kinase levels.
- Kell blood group system: A blood group system comprising of 31 antigens, including the Kell antigen.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific cure for McLeod syndrome. Treatment involves the management of symptoms. Individuals with Kell-positive blood can receive Kell-negative blood transfusions to avoid hemolytic reactions.

## Drug Response
The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) does not list any drugs that are specifically associated with the KEL gene.
