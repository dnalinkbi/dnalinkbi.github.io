# Information on Gene MTHFR

### Gene Function
MTHFR gene encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme that plays a crucial role in folate metabolism. It catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a precursor of methionine synthesis essential for DNA methylation.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: HGNC:7454
- NCBI Entrez: 4524
- Ensembl: ENSG00000177000
- OMIM: 607093
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9UIS9 

MTHFR gene is located on chromosome 1 at the location 1p36.22.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation type with dbSNP ID
- rs1801131: A1298C
- rs1801133: C677T

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no reported somatic mutations for this gene in dbSNP.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the MTHFR gene have been associated with various diseases including:
- Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Deficiency
- Cardiovascular Diseases
- Neural Tube Defects
- Homocysteinemia

### Treatment and Prognosis
Mutations in the MTHFR gene may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, which can be treated with folate and B vitamin supplements. Prognosis depends on the severity and type of mutation.

### Drug Response
Patients with MTHFR gene mutations have been reported to show variable response to drugs such as methotrexate, aminopterin, and 5-fluorouracil.
