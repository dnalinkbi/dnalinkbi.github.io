# Information about gene FPGS

## Genetic position, pathology, and function

- **Genetic position**: The FPGS gene is located on chromosome 9q22.3.
- **Pathology**: Variations in FPGS gene expression have been associated with certain types of cancers, including leukemia, colon cancer, and breast cancer. 
- **Function**: The FPGS gene encodes the Folylpolyglutamate Synthetase protein, which is involved in the metabolism of folate and related compounds. FPGS catalyzes the addition of glutamate residues to folate and antifolate compounds, which helps to maintain intracellular folate levels.

- There are somatic variations reported in the FPGS gene in COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database:
    - c.385A>G (p.Pro129Arg) (COSM1412331)
    - c.83G>A (p.Gly28Ser) (COSM1368994)
    - c.1243C>T (p.Arg415Ter) (COSM1369734)

## Related Disease

- The FPGS gene has been associated with several diseases, such as:
    - Congenital folate malabsorption
    - Megaloblastic anemia due to inborn errors of metabolism
    - Leukemia
    - Breast cancer
    - Colon cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There are no specific treatments available for FPGS-related conditions, but folate supplementation has been used to treat certain types of anemia caused by folate deficiency.
- The prognosis for FPGS-associated diseases depends on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

## Drug Response

- Variations in the FPGS gene have been associated with differences in response to certain drugs, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed.
