# Genetic Information Analysis: TPH2 Gene

## Gene Information

- The Tryptophan Hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene is located on the chromosomal location 12q21.1.
- The TPH2 gene encodes the enzyme Tryptophan Hydroxylase 2, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of serotonin in the brain.

## Function for gene 

- Tryptophan Hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene is responsible for the production of the protein which is essential for converting tryptophan into serotonin.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID

- No non-synonymous mutations have been reported in TPH2 till now.
 
## somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- No somatic variants have been reported in TPH2 till now.
 
## Related disease

- The dysregulation of the TPH2 gene has been linked with several psychiatric conditions including suicidal behavior, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

## Treatment and prognosis

- The appropriate psychiatric therapy for the conditions caused by TPH2 dysregulation varies with each condition.
 
## Drug response

- Drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used for the treatment of depression.
