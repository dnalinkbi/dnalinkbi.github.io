# Gene Information for ASPRV1

## Background
The ASPRV1 gene encodes a serine protease that is a member of the peptidase S1 family. This gene is located on chromosome 4 (4q25).

## Function for gene
The ASPRV1 gene encodes a protein called aspartic protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5), which acts as a protease inhibitor and is involved in regulating the activity of other proteases. SPINK5 has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of skin barrier function.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The following are a few known mutations in ASPRV1 with their corresponding mutation types and rsIDs from dbSNP:
- p.Trp198Ter (nonsense; rs61732874)
- p.Arg315* (nonsense; rs61735084)
- p.Gln490Arg (missense; rs121909008)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in ASPRV1.

## Related disease
Mutations in the ASPRV1 gene have been linked to Netherton syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by skin abnormalities, hair abnormalities, and an increased risk of allergic diseases.

## Treatment and prognosis
There is currently no cure for Netherton syndrome, and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms associated with the disorder. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary. The prognosis for individuals with Netherton syndrome varies depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Drug response
There is currently no specific drug that has been approved for the treatment of Netherton syndrome.
