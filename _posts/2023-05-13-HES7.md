**Gene:** HES7

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 17: 53,842,505-53,852,774

**Pathology and Function:** HES7 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene known to be involved in somitogenesis, the process of vertebrate embryonic development that forms somites. It regulates the timing and formation of somites, which are repeated units of the embryonic body plan that eventually become the vertebrae, skeletal muscle, and dermis.

**Function for Gene:** The function of HES7 is to negatively regulate the Notch signaling pathway during somitogenesis by acting as a transcriptional repressor.

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**

There are several missense and frameshift mutations reported in the HES7 gene. Some of the notable ones are:

| Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Ala17Pro | Missense | rs139439027 |
| Asp39Asn | Missense | rs143939238 |
| Glu83Ter | Frameshift | rs886043259 |
| Leu161Cys | Missense | rs370097569 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported in the HES7 gene.

**Related Disease:**

Mutations in the HES7 gene are associated with vertebral segmentation defects, including spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD) and congenital scoliosis. These are rare disorders characterized by various skeletal abnormalities of the spine and ribs.

**Treatment and Prognosis:**

The treatment options for vertebral segmentation defects depend on the severity and extent of the deformities. They may involve surgical interventions and/or orthotic devices. Prognosis for these disorders can be variable and typically depends on early diagnosis, appropriate management, and supportive care.

**Drug Response:**

There is no known drug specifically targeting HES7 gene mutations associated with vertebral segmentation defects.
