## Gene: HIP1

### Genetic Position:
- Chromosome: 7
- Location: 7q11.23

### Pathology:
- Mutations in HIP1 gene have been associated with multiple diseases including cancers, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia.
- A single-nucleotide polymorphism in HIP1 gene (rs11615) has been linked to susceptibility to breast cancer in women.

### Function:
- The HIP1 gene encodes huntingtin-interacting protein 1, which plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is involved in several cellular processes including intracellular trafficking, receptor internalization, and regulation of actin dynamics.
- It also interacts with huntingtin, a protein that is mutated in Huntington's disease, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
