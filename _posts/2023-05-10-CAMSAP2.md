# Gene CAMSAP2

## Information about Gene

CAMSAP2 (Calmodulin Regulated Spectrin-Associated Protein 2) gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 at position 22.1. It is transcribed into mRNA, which is involved in microtubule organization and cytoskeleton maintenance in cells. 

## Function for Gene

The CAMSAP2 gene encodes a protein that promotes the polymerization and organization of microtubules in cells. Microtubules are essential for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and are involved in the formation of intracellular transport routes.

## Related Disease

CAMSAP2 gene mutations have been linked to several types of cancer, including breast, liver, and lung cancers. In some cases, CAMSAP2 mutations have also been associated with other diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments available for CAMSAP2 mutations. However, research is ongoing to investigate potential therapies that aim to target microtubule organization in cancer cells. The prognosis for patients with CAMSAP2 mutations varies depending on the specific mutation and the type and stage of the associated cancer.

## Drug Response

Limited information is available on the drug response of CAMSAP2-mutated tumors. However, preclinical studies suggest that CAMSAP2 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for treating certain types of cancer.
