### Gene: KCND3

**Genetic Position and Genomic Location:** KCND3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1p13.3) from base pair 37,707,877 to base pair 37,793,121.

**Function:** The KCND3 gene encodes the Kv4.3 protein, which is a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a critical role in regulating the excitability of neurons. This protein is important for regulating the action potential duration in the heart, and mutations in this gene have been found to be related to cardiac arrhythmias.
