# Gene: POU4F3 

### Genetic Position:

- Chromosome: 5 
- Location: 5q32 
- Strand: minus 

### Pathology: 

POU4F3 is associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA15), which affects the inner ear. 

### Function: 

POU4F3 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for the differentiation and survival of cochlear hair cells, which are responsible for auditory function.

### External IDs, Aliases and Genomic Location: 

- HGNC ID: 9237 
- NCBI Entrez ID: 5458 
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000113448 
- OMIM ID: 601544 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P78425 
- Aliases: BRN3C, BRN-3C, OCT11 

### AA Mutation List and Types (with dbSNP ID):
