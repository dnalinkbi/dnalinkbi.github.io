# Information about Gene ADK

## Genetic Position
The ADK (adenosine kinase) gene is located at chromosomal location 10q22.2.

## Pathology
A mutation in ADK gene has been associated with increased susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) (PMID: 21926974).

## Function
The ADK gene encodes for the adenosine kinase enzyme, which plays a role in regulating the levels of adenosine, an important signaling molecule, in cells. It catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine to form AMP, which is then further metabolized to form ATP.
