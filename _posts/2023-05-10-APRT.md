# APRT Gene

## Genetic Position
The APRT (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene is located on chromosome 16q24.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the APRT gene can lead to an inherited disorder called APRT deficiency, which results in the formation of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease.

## Function 
The APRT gene encodes the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, which is involved in the purine salvage pathway, converting adenine to AMP and hypoxanthine to IMP.

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
Here is a list of some of the mutations in the APRT gene that have been associated with APRT deficiency:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Arg11His | Missense | rs121434331 |
| p.Arg29Cys | Missense | rs104894340 |
| p.Gly79Arg | Missense | rs121434332 |
| p.Leu90Pro | Missense | rs121434333 |
| c.-46C>T | Regulatory | rs755239642 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in the APRT gene.

## Related Disease
APRT deficiency can lead to the formation of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment options for APRT deficiency include a low-purine diet, hydration therapy, and the use of allopurinol to reduce uric acid levels. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to treatment.

## Drug Response
Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is commonly used to treat APRT deficiency by reducing uric acid levels and preventing the formation of kidney stones.
