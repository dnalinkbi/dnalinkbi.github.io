# Gene: MGME1

## Genetic Position
MGME1 is located on chromosome 20 at position 20q13.2.

## Pathology and Function
MGME1 encodes a mitochondrial protein that is involved in the biogenesis and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. It possesses both exonuclease and endonuclease activity, which allows it to degrade and process DNA. Mutation in this gene may lead to mitochondrial DNA instability and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.

## Related Disease
MGME1 mutations have been associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no known cure for MGME1-related diseases, but treatment is usually focused on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. The prognosis for individuals with MGME1 mutations varies depending on the specific mutation and the severity of the associated symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is currently no specific drug known to target the defects caused by MGME1 mutations.
