# Gene UNC5CL 

## Gene position, pathology and function
- **Position:** UNC5CL gene is located on the chromosome 4q21.21.
- **Pathology:** Studies have revealed that UNC5CL gene is involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers including colorectal, breast and lung cancer. It has been found that there is an upregulation of UNC5CL gene expression in colorectal cancer which leads to an increased invasion and migration of tumor cells.
- **Function**: The UNC5CL gene encodes for a protein that plays a role in axonal guidance, cell migration and apoptosis. The protein has been shown to interact with netrin-1 and modulates the netrin-1 signaling pathway.
