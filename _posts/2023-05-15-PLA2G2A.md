## Gene Information

**Gene**: PLA2G2A

**Function for Gene**: This gene encodes a member of the phospholipase A2 family. The encoded protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids into fatty acids and lysophospholipids. This protein plays a significant role in the inflammatory response by regulating the production of lipid inflammatory mediators.
