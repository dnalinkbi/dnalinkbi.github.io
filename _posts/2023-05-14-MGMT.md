## Information on Gene MGMT

### Gene information
The MGMT gene is located on chromosome 10q26 and is composed of 5 exons that encode the O^6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein. 

### Function
The MGMT protein repairs mutagenic and cytotoxic lesions in DNA, including adducts formed by alkylating agents. Methylation of the O^6 atom of guanine is one such lesion, and if left unrepaired can lead to cell death or mutagenesis.

### Related disease
MGMT methylation status has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including glioblastoma, colorectal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.

### Treatment and prognosis
The status of MGMT promoter methylation has been shown to influence response to alkylating chemotherapy in glioblastoma patients. Those with methylation have been found to have a better prognosis compared to those without methylation. 

### Drug response
MGMT promoter methylation has been used as a biomarker to predict response to alkylating chemotherapy agents such as temozolomide.
