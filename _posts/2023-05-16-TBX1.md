## Information about gene TBX1

**Genetic position**: The TBX1 gene is located at the chromosomal location 22q11.2.

**Pathology**: Mutations or deletions in the TBX1 gene are associated with various disorders of the 22q11.2 region, such as DiGeorge syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome.

**Function**: The TBX1 gene encodes a transcription factor, which is involved in the regulation of development and morphogenesis of various organs, such as the heart, thymus, parathyroid glands, and craniofacial structures.

**External IDs and Aliases**:
- HGNC: 11598
- NCBI Entrez: 6899
- Ensembl: ENSG00000117399
- OMIM: 602054
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O43435

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: There are various reported mutations in the TBX1 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations. Some examples of amino acid (AA) mutations with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs are:
- R237W (missense, rs3740249)
- A347P (missense, rs104894305)
- Q246X (nonsense, rs137854201)
- K156del (frameshift, rs796052003)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are no reported somatic mutations in the TBX1 gene.

**Related Disease**: Mutations or deletions in the TBX1 gene are associated with various disorders of the 22q11.2 region, such as DiGeorge syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. These disorders are characterized by various clinical features, including congenital heart defects, immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and craniofacial abnormalities.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: The management of TBX1-related disorders depends on the specific clinical features and complications in each case. Treatment may involve surgical interventions, corrective therapies for heart defects, hormone replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism, and immunodeficiency management. The prognosis varies depending on the severity and extent of the clinical features.

**Drug Response**: There is no specific drug targeted towards TBX1-related disorders. However, various medications may be used to manage the specific clinical features and complications of these disorders.
