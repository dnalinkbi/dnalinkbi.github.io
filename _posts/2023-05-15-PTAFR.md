## Gene: PTAFR

### Genomic Location and External IDs
- Gene: PTAFR (Platelet-activating factor receptor)
- Chromosomal Location: 1p31.1
- Alias: PAFR
- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 8556
    - NCBI Entrez Gene: 5729
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000158772
    - OMIM: 601470
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15111

### Function
The PTAFR gene encodes for a protein called platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), which is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various biological functions such as inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several known mutations in the PTAFR gene with their corresponding amino acid changes and dbSNP IDs, including:
- c.328A>G (p.Asp110Gly) rs16982746
- c.454G>T (p.Glu152Asp) rs2276907
- c.521G>A (p.Arg174Gln) rs2276908
- c.1022C>T (p.Pro341Leu) rs2276909
- c.1142C>T (p.Ala381Val) rs2276910

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) in the PTAFR gene with their corresponding dbSNP IDs, including:
- rs769308276
- rs786204012
- rs783100731
- rs782292089
- rs368124474

### Related Disease
Studies have suggested that PTAFR plays a role in various diseases, including:
- Allergies
- Inflammatory disorders
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for PTAFR-related diseases, but there are various treatments available to manage the symptoms of these diseases. The prognosis depends on the severity of the underlying condition.

### Drug Response
Some drugs have shown to target the PTAFR protein and may have potential therapeutic implications for PTAFR-related diseases. For example, Lofexidine was found to be a selective and potent antagonist of PTAFR.
