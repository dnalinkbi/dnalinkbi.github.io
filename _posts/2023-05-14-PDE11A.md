# Information about Gene PDE11A

## Genetic Position

* **Gene Name:** PDE11A
* **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 2 (2q31.2)
* **Aliases:** PPNAD3, PDEI, PDE11A3, RP4-647D15.6

## Function
PDE11A encodes for phosphodiesterase 11A, an enzyme involved in cyclic nucleotide metabolism. This protein plays a vital role in signaling pathways that regulate various cellular processes such as smooth muscle relaxation, cardiac contractility, and insulin secretion.

## External IDs

* **HGNC ID:** HGNC:8762
* **NCBI Entrez ID:** 50940
* **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000169893
* **OMIM ID:** 604961
* **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9HCR9

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

Currently, there are few known amino acid mutations for the PDE11A gene in the human population. Below is the list of mutations with their mutation type and corresponding dbSNP ID:

|Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|--------|-------------|--------|
|L677V   |Missense     |rs61754073|
|I381T   |Missense     |rs137852616|

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There is no known somatic SNVs/InDels for the PDE11A gene.

## Related Disease

Studies have found the association of PDE11A gene mutations with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). In this rare disease, benign tumors form in the adrenal gland, affecting the production of certain hormones such as cortisol.

## Treatment and Prognosis

The current treatment options for PPNAD include surgical removal of affected tissues, steroid resistance therapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis varies depending on the severity and extent of the disease.

## Drug Response

Currently, there are no known drugs that specifically target PDE11A. However, PDE inhibitors such as sildenafil and tadalafil have been used to treat PPNAD-related symptoms.
