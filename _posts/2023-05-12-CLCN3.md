## Gene Information

### Gene CLCN3
- **Function**: The CLCN3 gene encodes a chloride channel protein that regulates the flow of negatively charged chloride ions in and out of cells, helping to maintain proper cell volume and pH levels. It is involved in several physiological processes, including the regulation of endosomal/lysosomal acidification and intracellular chloride homeostasis.
- **External IDs and Aliases**:
    - External IDs: HGNC:2038, NCBI Gene:1184, Ensembl:ENSG00000169174, OMIM:602124, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y6N6
    - Aliases: CLC3, HGEA, HGEA1, CLC-3

### Genomic Location
- Chromosome: 4
- Location: 4q32.1

## Mutations and Variants

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- The CLCN3 gene has several known amino acid mutations. Some of the most common ones include:
    - R200Q (rs3736149)
    - A737V (rs1800250)
    - R746C (rs3736165)
    - G820R (rs1805124)
    - G858R (rs1805125)
    
### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are currently no known somatic SNVs or InDels in the CLCN3 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Mutations in the CLCN3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including:
    - Dent's disease: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, leading to the buildup of certain substances in the body and the development of kidney stones. Mutations in the CLCN3 gene are one of the causes of Dent's disease.
    - Schizophrenia: There is some evidence to suggest that variations in the CLCN3 gene may be associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.
    - Other conditions: Mutations in the CLCN3 gene have also been implicated in some cases of osteopetrosis, Bartter syndrome, and some types of epilepsy.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for genetic disorders caused by mutations in the CLCN3 gene. Treatment is usually focused on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. For example, patients with Dent's disease may require medications to help manage kidney stones, while those with epilepsy may require anticonvulsant medications.
- The prognosis for individuals with CLCN3 gene mutations varies depending on the specific disorder and the severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the CLCN3 gene, although some medications used to manage symptoms of related disorders may indirectly affect the function of the gene.
