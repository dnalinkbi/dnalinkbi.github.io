**Gene information**

Gene: ASMT (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase)

Pathology: Mutations in ASMT have been linked to sleep and mood disorders, such as delayed sleep phase disorder and bipolar disorder.

Function: ASMT encodes an enzyme involved in the melatonin biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the final step in melatonin synthesis, converting N-acetylserotonin to melatonin.

**Related disease**

Mutations in ASMT have been associated with:
- Delayed sleep phase disorder (OMIM: 614163)
- Mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder (OMIM: 125480) 

**Treatment and prognosis**

There is currently no specific treatment for ASMT-related sleep or mood disorders. Treatment generally involves managing symptoms with various therapies, such as light therapy for delayed sleep phase disorder or mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder. The prognosis for individuals with ASMT mutations depends on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.

**Drug response**

There is limited information on drug response in individuals with ASMT mutations. However, some studies have suggested that melatonin supplementation may be beneficial for individuals with delayed sleep phase disorder.
