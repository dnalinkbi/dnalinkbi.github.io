# Information about gene CDK5RAP2

## Genetic Position
CDK5RAP2 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 2) is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 at position 9q33.2.

## Pathology
Mutations in the CDK5RAP2 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly type 3 (MCPH3), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a reduction in head circumference and intellectual disability.

## Function
CDK5RAP2 is involved in the regulation of the centrosome cycle, which is essential for cell division and formation of the microtubule network. It is also known to be involved in DNA damage response and neuronal migration during brain development.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations in CDK5RAP2 are currently listed in the dbSNP database.

## Related Disease
Mutations in CDK5RAP2 have been associated with Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly type 3 (MCPH3) which is characterized by a reduced head circumference and intellectual disability.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are no specific treatments or cures for MCPH3, and the prognosis depends on the severity of the condition.

## Drug Response
There is currently no information available regarding drug response for MCPH3.
