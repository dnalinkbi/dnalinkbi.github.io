## Information for gene CSNK1D

- **Genetic position**: Chromosome 17q25.3
- **Pathology**: Mutations in CSNK1D have been linked to several diseases, including breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
- **Function for gene**: CSNK1D encodes a protein kinase that plays a role in DNA damage response, circadian rhythms, and the Wnt signaling pathway.
