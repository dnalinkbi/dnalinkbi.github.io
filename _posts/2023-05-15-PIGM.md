# Gene PIGM 

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- PIGM is located on chromosome Xq22.1. 
- Mutations in this gene cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome 2 (MCAHS2), also known as Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy-39 (EIEE39). 
- MCAHS2 is characterized by global developmental delay, congenital malformations, hypotonia, and epilepsy. 

## Function for Gene
- PIGM encodes a protein called phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class M (PIGM), which is involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. 
- GPI anchoring is a post-translational modification that attaches specific proteins to the cell membrane. 
- PIGM is specifically involved in the second step of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which is the de-N-acetylation of N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol (GlcNAc-PI) to generate Man(2)GlcN-PI.

## Related Disease
- Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome 2 (MCAHS2), also known as Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy-39 (EIEE39). 

## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for MCAHS2, and treatment is primarily supportive, with a focus on managing symptoms such as seizures and developmental delays. 
- The prognosis for individuals with MCAHS2 is poor, with most individuals having significant neurological impairment and a reduced life expectancy. 

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug treatment for MCAHS2.
