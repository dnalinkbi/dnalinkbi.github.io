# Information about Gene ST14

## Gene information
- **Function:** The ST14 gene encodes a serine protease that is involved in the processing of precursor proteins like growth factors and adhesion molecules. It is also involved in cell signaling pathways and regulation of membrane-bound proteins.  
- **External IDs and Aliases:** The gene is also known as MT-SP1, SNC19, Prss14, and HAI. The genomic location of the ST14 gene is on chromosome 11q24.2-q24.3.

## Mutations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are multiple genetic variations associated with ST14 gene. A missense variation in ST14 gene at AA position 222 (p.Val222Ile) has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to atopic dermatitis [(rs2069952)]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs2069952).) 

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- **dbSNP ID:** There are multiple somatic variations associated with ST14 gene. One of the somatic variations includes c.1478G>A (p.Arg493Gln) [(rs139068658)]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs139068658).)

## Related Diseases
- ST14 has been implicated in the pathology of **cancer, skin diseases** and **inflammatory bowel disease**.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- ST14 is a potential target for treatment in some cancers and inflammatory diseases. However, more research is needed to fully understand its role in these diseases and to develop effective treatments.

## Drug response
- In a study, it has been reported that the use of a ST14 inhibitor reduces melanoma cell invasion and migration and increases cell death [(PMID:26542145)]([Click](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26542145).)
