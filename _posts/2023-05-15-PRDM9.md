# Gene PRDM9

### Information
PRDM9 is a gene located on chromosome 5. It encodes for a protein with a zinc finger DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in meiotic recombination. Mutations in PRDM9 gene have been associated with infertility and recurrent miscarriages.

### Function 
PRDM9 is involved in the initiation of meiotic recombination and promotes the formation of double-strand breaks on DNA. This function is essential for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis, which ensures the correct distribution of genetic information in offspring.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in PRDM9 have been associated with infertility, specifically with meiotic arrest at pachytene stage, as well as with recurrent miscarriages. In addition, some studies suggest a potential involvement of PRDM9 in cancer development.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for PRDM9 related infertility or recurrent miscarriages. However, genetic counseling may be recommended for affected individuals and their families.

### Drug Response
There is currently no known drug response associated with mutations in PRDM9.
