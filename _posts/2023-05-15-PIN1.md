# Gene: PIN1

### Function:
PIN1 gene encodes a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization at specific phosphorylated proline residues that play a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and it also acts as a molecular chaperone to regulate protein folding stability.

### External IDs and Genomic Location:

- HGNC: 8981
- NCBI Entrez: 5300
- Ensembl: ENSG00000138107
- OMIM: 601052
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q13526

PIN1 is located on chromosome 19q13.2.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:
- p.Pro38Ser (rs2233678)
- p.Arg68Gly (rs2233679)
- p.Leu100Met (rs2233680)
- p.Ser138Leu (rs2233681)
- p.Arg155Ser (rs2233682)
- p.Arg159Gly (rs2233683)

The above mutations are all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in the coding region and resulting in amino acid substitutions.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are somatic mutations in the PIN1 gene, but there is no available information about dbSNP IDs.

### Related diseases:
PIN1 has been associated with various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and age-related macular degeneration.

### Treatment and prognosis:
There is no specific treatment available for PIN1 related diseases. However, some drugs are being developed that target PIN1, the inhibition of which is being considered as a potential therapeutic approach for cancer. A study has shown that PIN1 inhibition can improve cognitive memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease.

### Drug response:
Several drugs have been reported to be effective in inhibiting PIN1 function, including Juglone, PiB, and PiM1. They have shown promising results in preclinical studies for the treatment of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
