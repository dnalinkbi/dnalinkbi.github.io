# Gene: PGR - Progesterone Receptor

## Information

- **Genetic Position:** Chr11:100,614,182-100,680,272 (+/-)
- **Pathology:** Progesterone receptor is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and uterine fibroids.
- **Function:** Progesterone receptor is activated by progesterone hormone and plays a crucial role in regulating the menstrual cycle, implantation, pregnancy, and mammary gland development.

## Related Disease 

- Breast cancer
- Endometrial cancer
- Uterine fibroids
- Ovarian cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis

- Several treatments including endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are available for patients with PGR-positive breast cancer depending on the severity and stage of the disease.
- Prognosis depends on various factors including the stage of cancer, the age of the patient, and the overall health condition. 

## Drug Response

- The response to endocrine therapy varies depending on the PGR expression level and subtype of breast cancer. PGR expression is considered a positive prognostic factor and endocrine therapy is highly effective in PGR-positive patients.
