# Gene FGF23

### Gene Information
- **Function:** Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) is a protein that regulates phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate and the synthesis of bioactive vitamin D in the kidney.
- **External IDs:** 
    * Gene ID: 8074
    * Genomic location: Chromosome 12 (12p13)
    * Aliases: ADHR, HFTC2, PHPTC1, HPDR2
- **External Sites:**
    * HGNC: 3678
    * NCBI Entrez: [8074](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8074))
    * Ensembl: [ENSG00000137857](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000137857;r=12:4377979-4435279))
    * OMIM: [605380](https://www.omim.org/entry/605380))
    * UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: [Q9GZV9](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZV9))


### Mutations
- **AA Mutation List with Mutation Type and dbSNP ID:**
    * p.R176Q: Missense variant, rs1801719
    * p.S71G: Missense variant, rs17131806
    * p.R56G: Missense variant, rs397515420
    * p.T178M: Missense variant, rs143650872
    * p.S129G: Missense variant, rs150166280
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** None reported.


### Related Diseases
- Inactivating mutations in FGF23 have been associated with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), and hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome (HHS).
- FGF23 has also been found to be elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can lead to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).


### Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for FGF23-related disorders focuses on managing phosphate levels and preventing long-term complications such as bone demineralization.
- Prognosis varies depending on the severity and type of FGF23-related disorder.


### Drug Response
- Treatment options for FGF23-related disorders may include phosphate supplements, vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetic agents. These treatments may impact FGF23 levels and its downstream effects on phosphate and calcium metabolism.
