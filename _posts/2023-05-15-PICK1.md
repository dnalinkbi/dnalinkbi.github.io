## Gene Information for PICK1

### Gene Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Gene Name**: Protein Interacting with C Kinase 1 (PICK1)
- **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 22q13.33
- **Aliases**: PRKCABP, HNRNPCUL1

**Function for Gene**: PICK1 is a crucial protein that plays a vital role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. It is involved in various neuronal processes, including receptor trafficking, ion channel regulation, and membrane trafficking. Additionally, it modulates the function of various receptors, including AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and dopamine receptors.

**External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases**:

- **HGNC**: 1879
- **NCBI Entrez**: 9468
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000128274
- **OMIM**: 602340
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: Q9NRD5

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID**: There are numerous mutations in the PICK1 gene, some of which are:

- p.Cys92Arg (rs2304953)
- p.Leu126Val (rs137854066)
- p.Arg195His (rs137854065)

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: Currently, there is no information available for somatic SNVs/InDels in the PICK1 gene.

**Related Disease**: Several brain disorders, including schizophrenia, addiction, and Alzheimer's disease, are associated with the PICK1 gene and its mutations. The mutations in the PICK1 gene that alter its function are linked to the etiology of these diseases.

**Treatment and Prognosis**: As of now, there is no known cure for the diseases associated with the PICK1 gene. However, various drugs targeting the PICK1 protein are in development that could help control the symptoms of these disorders in the future.

**Drug Response**: The PICK1 protein is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various brain disorders. Several drugs, including FSC-231 and Dihydrexidine, have been shown to interact with the PICK1 protein and modulate its function.
