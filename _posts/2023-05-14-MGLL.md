# **Information about Gene MGLL**

## Genetic Position
MGLL gene is located on chromosome 3q21.3, which spans from base pair 128,984,452 to 129,030,326.

## Pathology
MGLL encodes the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of monoglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids. Dysregulation of MGLL has been associated with several metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer.

## Function for gene
MGLL plays an important role in the regulation of endocannabinoid signaling, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis.

## Related Disease
Dysregulation of MGLL has been associated with several metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer.

## Treatment and prognosis
MGLL inhibitors have shown potential in the treatment of pain, inflammation, anxiety, and cancer. However, further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these inhibitors.

## Drug response
MGLL inhibitors, such as JZL184 and KML29, have shown promising results in preclinical studies for the treatment of various diseases. However, their clinical efficacy and safety are yet to be established.
