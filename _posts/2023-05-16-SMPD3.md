### Gene SMPD3 | Acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3
- **Function for gene**: The SMPD3 gene encodes the enzyme Acid Sphingomyelinase-like Phosphodiesterase 3, which is involved in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, a membrane lipid, into ceramide and phosphocholine. This breakdown has been implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell growth. 

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: HGNC:14017, NCBI Entrez Gene:6604, Ensembl:ENSG00000103101, OMIM:611490, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q9H9N4. The genomic location of the gene is on chromosome 11q14.2. Aliases for SMPD3 gene include ASM-like phosphodiesterase 3, ASM-LP3, Ac-sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3, and NPP7.

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - There are several AA mutations linked to SMPD3 gene. Some examples of mutations with their respective mutation type and dbSNP ID are listed below -
        - Leu-710-Tyr (missense) - rs200656871
        - Glu-212-Lys (missense) - rs61748429
        - Ser-119-Cys (missense) - rs780385518
        - Gly-311-Arg (missense) - rs62083095

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: There are no somatic SNVs/InDels identified in SMPD3 gene so far.

- **Related disease**: SMPD3 gene has been implicated in various diseases like metastatic breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Alzheimer's disease. Mutations and loss of function of SMPD3 have been linked to decreased ceramide production, leading to an increased risk of cell survival and tumor growth in breast cancer. 

- **Treatment and prognosis**: There is no specific treatment for SMPD3-related diseases yet. However, targeting the upstream regulators of ceramide metabolism, which affect SMPD3 activity, might hold promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. 

- **Drug response**: There is no known drug response for SMPD3 gene.
