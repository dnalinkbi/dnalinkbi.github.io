## Gene: CSF2

### Genetic Position
The CSF2 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.1.

### Pathology and Function
The CSF2 gene encodes a cytokine called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF promotes the differentiation, proliferation, and activation of hematopoietic cells, including granulocytes and macrophages. Aberrant expression of GM-CSF has been associated with various diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer.

### Related Disease
Aberrant expression of GM-CSF has been associated with various diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer.

### Treatment and Prognosis
In disease states with elevated GM-CSF expression, targeting this cytokine with drugs such as mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, may be effective in managing symptoms. The prognosis of diseases associated with aberrant GM-CSF expression depends on the specific disease and its stage.

### Drug Response
Mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets GM-CSF, has been shown to be effective in managing symptoms of diseases associated with elevated GM-CSF expression.
