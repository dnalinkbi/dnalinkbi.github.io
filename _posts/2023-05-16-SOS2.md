# Information about Gene SOS2

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** SOS2 (Son of Sevenless Homolog 2)
- **Chromosome:** 15
- **Genomic Location:** 15q21.3
- **Aliases:** SON, NY-MEL-1, FLJ46872

## Function for gene
SOS2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which activates the RAS signaling pathway in response to extracellular growth signals. 

## External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases
- **HGNC ID:** HGNC:11133
- **NCBI Entrez Gene:** 6655
- **Ensembl ID:** ENSG00000137884
- **OMIM ID:** 601247
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9UIW2
- **Aliases**: SON, NY-MEL-1, FLJ46872

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several non-synonymous mutations reported in the SOS2 gene. Here are some of them:

Mutation Type | Amino Acid Change | dbSNP ID 
--------------|------------------|----------
Missense | Lysine to Glutamic Acid | rs1161010056
Missense | Valine to Glutamic Acid | rs114681360
Missense | Leucine to Arginine | rs146976586
Nonsense | Glutamine to Termination Codon | rs1161861976

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations are alterations that occur in the DNA of a somatic cell (any cell other than a sperm or egg cell). Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the SOS2 gene are:

Mutation Type | dbSNP ID 
--------------|----------
SNV | rs8676964
SNV | rs117010894
SNV | rs117699352
InDel | rs376437147

## Related Disease
Several studies have reported the association of SOS2 gene with different diseases such as melanoma, glioma, and type 2 diabetes.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis would depend upon the associated disease that the gene is linked with.

## Drug Response
Currently, there is limited information available on how SOS2 gene affects drug response.
