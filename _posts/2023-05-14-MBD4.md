## Gene MBD4

The gene MBD4 encodes a protein called Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4, which is part of the DNA repair system. The function of MBD4 is to correct mismatches that occasionally arise due to erroneous base incorporation during DNA replication or due to spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine.

### Function of gene

MBD4 interacts with MutSα, a DNA repair protein, and performs the repair of base mismatches, which can cause DNA damage. Additionally, it has a role in DNA demethylation process by binding to methylated DNA and recruiting other proteins that erase DNA methylation marks.
