## Information on gene CACNB4

### Genetic Position
The gene CACNB4 is located on chromosome 2q23.3. It spans approximately 103.5 kb and consists of 16 exons.

### Pathology
Mutations in CACNB4 have been associated with several neurological and psychological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

### Function
CACNB4 encodes a subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, which is involved in neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and neuronal excitability.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment available for mutations in CACNB4. Treatment mainly involves managing the symptoms associated with the disorder. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and the severity of mutations.

### Drug Response
There are currently no known drugs that specifically target CACNB4 mutations. However, some antipsychotic and antiepileptic drugs have been used to manage the symptoms associated with the disorders caused by mutations in CACNB4.
