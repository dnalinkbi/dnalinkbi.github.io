# Information about Gene HADHA

## Gene Information
- **Function for gene**: HADHA (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha) gene codes for a protein that is involved in fatty acid oxidation.
- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**: 
    - Gene ID: 3030
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 2q23.3
    - Aliases: HADH, ECHD, FASPS, LCEH

## Genomic Variations
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: 
    - p.Ile323Met Ins(2) - rs121434601
    - p.Met605Thr - rs28941768
    - p.Arg412Pro - rs28941769
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: None reported so far.

## Related Diseases
- Disorders associated with HADHA gene mutations include:
    - Trifunctional protein deficiency - This is a rare disorder that affects the breakdown of fats for energy and results in serious health problems.
    
## Treatment and Prognosis
- There is currently no cure for trifunctional protein deficiency, but treatment options include dietary management and medications to manage symptoms.
- The prognosis for this disorder is variable and depends on the severity of symptoms and response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- There is currently no specific drug available for the treatment of trifunctional protein deficiency, but some patients may be prescribed medications to manage symptoms.
