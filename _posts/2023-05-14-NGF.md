# Information on Gene NGF

## Gene Information

- **External ID:** NGF
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 1q22-q23
- **Aliases:** Beta-nerve growth factor, NGFB

## Function for Gene

NGF is a protein that is essential in the growth, function, and maintenance of certain nerve cells, known as sensory neurons and sympathetic neurons. It plays a significant role in the differentiation and survival of neurons during development and in adulthood. Furthermore, NGF is involved in inflammatory and autoimmunity responses, and its dysregulation contributes to various diseases.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

There are various missense mutations present in the NGF gene, which result in amino acid (AA) substitutions. Some of the most commonly occurring AA mutations include:

AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID
-----------|--------------|---------
V18M       | Missense     | rs121908689
R221W      | Missense     | rs121918424
R100W      | Missense     | rs121908691

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reports of somatic SNVs/InDels in the NGF gene to date.

## Related Disease

Various diseases are associated with the dysregulation of the NGF gene, including:

- Alzheimer's disease
- Cancer
- Huntington's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Anorexia

## Treatment and Prognosis

The correct treatment and prognosis of NGF gene-related diseases depend on the specific disease affecting the patient. Various drug targets have been identified that can help regulate NGF levels and provide symptomatic relief for specific diseases associated with NGF. Several ongoing preclinical and clinical trials show promising results in treating Alzheimer's disease by regulating NGF levels.

## Drug Response

The drug response for conditions associated with NGF gene dysregulation varies from disease to disease. For example, tanezumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to treat chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders by targeting NGF. Anti-NGF therapy is also being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of pain associated with other conditions, such as cancer and diabetic neuropathy.
