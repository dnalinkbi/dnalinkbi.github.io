# Gene: CES1

## Information

- **Function**: Carboxylesterase 1 is an enzyme that participates in drug metabolism and processing of xenobiotics, including the activation of drugs such as clopidogrel, a medication used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. CES1 also plays a role in lipid metabolism.
- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene: HGNC:1834
    - Genomic location: Chr16:67575952-67641135
    - Aliases: CES2, HMSE, HMSE1
- **External sites**: [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:1834),) [NCBI Entrez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1066),) [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000103316;r=16:67575952-67641135),) [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/entry/114835),) [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O00748))
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**: CES1 has numerous missense mutations, mostly classified as benign or likely benign, in the dbSNP database. However, some CES1 mutations have been associated with adverse drug reactions. For example:
    - rs71647871: c.1297A>G, p.Asn433Ser, associated with increased risk of clopidogrel resistance.
    - rs8192935: c.626G>A, p.Ser209Asn, associated with increased risk of toxic effects to the antiviral drug abacavir.
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**: CES1 somatic mutations have been reported in several cancer types, including breast and lung cancers. Some examples include:
    - rs1055225: c.1436C>T, p.Ala479Val, reported in a study of ovarian cancer.
    - rs1142345: c.522G>T, p.Arg174Leu, found in a lung cancer cell line.
- **Related disease**: CES1 mutations have been linked to adverse drug reactions and may play a role in conditions such as atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. However, CES1 is not a primary causative gene in any specific disease at this time.
- **Treatment and prognosis**: CES1 mutations may influence individual responses to certain drugs, particularly clopidogrel and abacavir. Genetic testing for CES1 variants may be useful in guiding medication selection and dosing. However, more research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of CES1 mutations.
- **Drug response**: CES1 plays a key role in drug metabolism and may influence individual responses to medications. CES1 variants are associated with varying levels of drug activation and clearance, which can impact treatment efficacy and toxicity. For example, individuals with CES1 variants associated with increased clopidogrel activation may require lower doses of the drug to achieve the same therapeutic effect.
