## FZD3 Gene Information

### Genetic Position

- FZD3 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 8 at position 22.1.
- The FZD3 gene spans 38,929 base pairs of DNA.

### Pathology

- The mutations in FZD3 gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.
- Abnormal activation of FZD3 signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of cancer and other diseases.

### Function

- The FZD3 gene encodes a member of the Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling pathway.
- FZD3 protein plays a crucial role in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cell proliferation.
