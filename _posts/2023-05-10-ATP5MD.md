# Gene ATP5MD

## Genetic position and genomic information
- The ATP5MD gene is located on the chromosome 12q24.31.
- The length of the gene is approximately 8.4 kilobases and it contains five exons. 
- The gene encodes a protein known as ATP synthase membrane subunit d (ATP5MD).

## Function for Gene
- The ATP5MD gene produces the ATP5MD protein, which is a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. 
- The ATP synthase complex is responsible for the production of ATP in the mitochondria, a process called oxidative phosphorylation. 
- The ATP5MD protein has been shown to be necessary for the proper assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex.

- Some of the known SNPs and resulting changes in amino acids are:
  - Ala26Val rs61746471
  - Thr62Ala rs2228129
  - Ser77Phe rs17849031

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There are several somatic mutations in the ATP5MD gene that have been identified in various cancer types.
- One example is:
  - c.194G>A (p.Gly65Glu) rs767258053

## Related disease
- Mutations in the ATP5MD gene have been found to be associated with mitochondrial disorders, such as Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial complex V deficiency.
- Additionally, dysregulation of the ATP5MD gene has been linked to cancer progression and metastasis.

## Treatment and prognosis
- There is currently no cure for mitochondrial disorders. Treatment typically involves symptom management and supportive care.
- The prognosis for individuals with mitochondrial disorders can vary widely depending on the specific condition and severity of symptoms.
- Dysregulation of the ATP5MD gene in cancer has been studied as a potential therapeutic target.

## Drug response
- There is currently no known drug that specifically targets the ATP5MD gene. 
- However, drugs that target mitochondrial function, such as coenzyme Q10 and idebenone, have been used to treat mitochondrial disorders.
