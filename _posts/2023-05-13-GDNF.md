## Gene: GDNF

### Function
GDNF (Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor) is a protein that promotes the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, which are responsible for producing dopamine. It is also involved in the development and function of other neurons in the peripheral and central nervous systems.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC: 4263
- NCBI Entrez: 2668
- Ensembl: ENSG00000116171
- OMIM: 600837
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P39905

GDNF is located on chromosome 5 at position q31.3.

Aliases: ATF, ATF1, HFB1-GDNF, HSCR3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type
There are several known mutations in GDNF associated with different diseases, such as Hirschsprung's disease and Parkinson's disease:
- R68T missense mutation (rs137853920) - associated with Hirschsprung's disease
- G166A missense mutation (rs74805565) - associated with Parkinson's disease
- T260M missense mutation (rs137853923) - associated with Hirschsprung's disease
- R276W missense mutation (rs879255083) - associated with Hirschsprung's disease

### Somatic SNVs/InDels
There are several somatic mutations in GDNF reported in the COSMIC database:
- R201Q missense mutation (COSM12381) - found in a colorectal adenocarcinoma sample
- P204fs frameshift deletion (COSM1468087) - found in a small intestine neuroendocrine carcinoma sample

### Related Disease
GDNF mutations have been associated with Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of nerves in parts of the intestine, and Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement.

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for Hirschsprung's disease, but treatments such as surgery and medication can manage symptoms. For Parkinson's disease, treatments may include medications, deep brain stimulation, and physical therapy. The prognosis for both diseases varies depending on the severity of the condition and individual factors.

### Drug Response
There is limited research on the potential drug response of GDNF mutations in Hirschsprung's disease and Parkinson's disease.
