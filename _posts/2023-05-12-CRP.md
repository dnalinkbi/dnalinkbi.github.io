# Gene: CRP

## Genetic Position
The CRP gene is located on chromosome 1q23.2.

## Pathology
CRP stands for C-reactive protein, which is an acute-phase reactant that is synthesized by the liver in response to inflammatory cytokines. Elevated CRP levels in the blood are associated with various inflammatory conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

## Function
The primary function of CRP is to bind to phosphocholine on the surface of microorganisms and damaged cells, leading to activation of the complement system and opsonization of the target for phagocytosis. CRP also plays a role in the clearance of apoptotic cells and modulates the activity of various immune cells.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Types with dbSNP IDs
There are several common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene that result in amino acid changes:
- rs1800947: p.Phe33Leu
- rs3093068: p.Ser144Gly
- rs1205: p.Pro184Ser
- rs2808630: p.Ala240Thr

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP IDs
There are many somatic mutations in the CRP gene catalogued in the dbSNP database.

## Related Diseases
- Cardiovascular disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Cancer
- Infectious diseases

## Treatment and Prognosis
Elevated CRP levels are often used as a biomarker for disease severity and response to treatment. Treatments for diseases associated with elevated CRP levels may involve anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, or chemotherapy.

## Drug Response
There is evidence to suggest that genetic variants in the CRP gene may influence responsiveness to certain drugs, such as statins and anti-TNF therapy.
