# Information about gene SLC13A2

## Genetic Position
SLC13A2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position 7q33.1.

## Pathology
Mutations in the SLC13A2 gene can cause idiopathic hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), which is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by low levels of magnesium and calcium ions in the blood. 

## Function for gene
SLC13A2 encodes a protein called solute carrier family 13 member 2 (SLC13A2), also known as the sodium-coupled di- and tricarboxylate transporter, NaDC-1. NaDC-1 is a transmembrane protein that is involved in the transportation of citrate, succinate, and other dicarboxylates across the plasma membrane into the cells.

Aliases: NaDC-1, SLC13A2, solute carrier family 13 (sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter), member 2 

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are various mutations and their types in the SLC13A2 gene, some of them are:

| AA mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| L16P | Missense | rs104894080 |
| Q603* | Nonsense | rs104894084 |
| Q251H | Missense | rs267606843 |
| P187L | Missense | rs267606841 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no available information about somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID in the SLC13A2 gene.

## Related Disease
- Idiopathic hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), autosomal recessive

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of HSH involves lifelong oral magnesium and calcium replacement therapy, which helps to manage the symptoms of the disease. The long-term prognosis varies, depending on the severity of the condition and the response to the treatment. 

## Drug Response
Currently, there is no specific drug treatment available for HSH. The condition is managed by oral magnesium and calcium replacement therapy.
