## Gene KCNJ6

### Genetic Position
KCNJ6 gene is located on the chromosome 21 in the position 21q22.11.

### Pathology
The KCNJ6 gene has been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Mutations and variations in this gene can affect the functioning of potassium ion channels in the brain.

### Function
The KCNJ6 gene encodes for a potassium channel subunit, Kir3.2, which plays an essential role in regulating the electrical activity of neurons in the brain. This protein is mainly found in the striatum, a region of the basal ganglia that is involved in the control of movement and reward.

Several amino acid (AA) mutations have been associated with KCNJ6 gene. 
- rs104894163 (p.Lys27Thr)
- rs35938016 (p.Asn146Ile)
- rs200776952 (p.Asp228Asn)
- rs137854079 (p.Tyr321Ser)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There is no reported somatic SNVs or InDels for KCNJ6 gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations and variations in the KCNJ6 gene have been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as:
- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
- Schizophrenia 
- Depression 
- Bipolar disorder 

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for genetic mutations in KCNJ6. However, symptoms associated with related disorders can be managed with medications, therapy, and lifestyle changes.

### Drug Response
Some studies suggest that the response to antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia can be influenced by genetic variations in the KCNJ6 gene.
