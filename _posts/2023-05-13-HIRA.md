# Gene Information on HIRA

**Function of gene:** HIRA gene encodes for a histone H3.3-specific chaperone which plays a vital role in nucleosome assembly and histone deposition. 

**External IDs for gene:** 
- Gene ID: 7290
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 22q11.21
- Aliases: HIR, DGCR6, HPC2, HUSSY28

**External sites:**
- HGNC: 4920
- NCBI Entrez: 7290
- Ensembl: ENSG00000100243
- OMIM: 600237
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O75636

**AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:**
- rs121912750: Gly25Ser - this mutation causes a change of glycine to serine at position 25 in the amino acid sequence of the HIRA protein.
- rs137853692: Arg40Cys - this mutation causes a change of arginine to cysteine at position 40 in the amino acid sequence of the HIRA protein.
- rs1804865: Pro521Leu - this mutation causes a change of proline to leucine at position 521 in the amino acid sequence of the HIRA protein.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**
- rs140360731: c.1A>G - this somatic mutation involves the substitution of adenine with guanine at the first nucleotide position of the HIRA gene.

**Related Disease:**
- HIRA-associated disorders: This gene is associated with various genetic disorders, including bone dysplasia characterized by simple platyspondyly, craniofacial abnormalities, and joint dislocations.

**Treatment and prognosis:**
- There is currently no cure for genetic disorders associated with HIRA mutations. Treatment is primarily focused on managing specific symptoms and complications associated with HIRA-associated conditions.

**Drug response:**
- There is no specific drug designed for the HIRA gene, and currently, there is no evidence that any drug directly targets this gene.

**Related research articles:**
- Sharma et al. (2015) has provided evidence that HIRA may play an important role in regulating DNA damage response.
- Funakoshi et al. (2021) describes the effect of HIRA mutations linked to non-syndromic hearing loss in humans.
