## Gene Information

### Gene Name

CCBE1 (Collagen and calcium-binding EGF domains 1)

### Function 

The CCBE1 gene encodes a protein which is essential for lymphangiogenesis. It plays a critical role in the development and growth of lymphatic vessels.

### Genomic Location (GRCh38.p13)

The CCBE1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 18 at position 11.2.

As of now, there are no null mutations reported for the CCBE1 gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are several somatic SNVs/InDels reported in the CCBE1 gene, which are associated with different types of cancer. Some of the known SNVs/InDels in CCBE1 are:

- c.773C>T (p.Arg258Ter) - rs1598025122
- c.651C>G (p.Pro217Arg) - rs779839195
- c.323delA (p.K108Tfs*5) - rs587779322

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the CCBE1 gene are associated with a rare condition called Hennekam syndrome, which is characterized by lymphangiectasia, lymphedema, and intellectual disability.

### Treatment and Prognosis

At present, there is no cure or specific treatment available for Hennekam syndrome. The treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis greatly depends on the severity of the symptoms.

### Drug Response

There are no drugs currently available that specifically target the CCBE1 gene.
