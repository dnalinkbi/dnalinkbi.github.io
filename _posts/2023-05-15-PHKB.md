# Gene Information for PHKB

## Genetic Position and Pathology
- **Gene:** PHKB (Phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit beta)
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 16q12.2
- **Pathology:** Mutations in PHKB have been associated with a glycogen storage disease called glycogen storage disease type IXa.

## Function of Gene
PHKB encodes a regulatory subunit of the phosphorylase kinase (PhK) complex, which is a key enzyme in regulating glycogen metabolism. The PhK complex is involved in the breakdown of glycogen in response to low energy levels in the body.

## External IDs and Aliases
- **HGNC ID:** 8978
- **NCBI Entrez Gene ID:** 5256
- **Ensembl Gene ID:** ENSG00000064195
- **OMIM ID:** 172490
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q9UQK8
- **Aliases:** PHK2, PHKIIB, GSD9B

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic SNVs/InDels for PHKB have been reported in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
Mutations in PHKB have been associated with glycogen storage disease type IXa. This disease causes a deficiency in the PhK complex, leading to a buildup of glycogen in liver and muscle tissues.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for glycogen storage disease type IXa, but treatment options include a low-carbohydrate and high-protein diet, regular exercise, and medication to control symptoms. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response in individuals with glycogen storage disease type IXa. However, studies have suggested that dietary interventions and exercise can improve glycemic control.
