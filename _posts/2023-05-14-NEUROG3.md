## Gene NEUROG3

### Genetic Position
The NEUROG3 gene is located on chromosome 10 at position p12.1. 

### Pathology
Mutations in the NEUROG3 gene have been linked to neonatal diabetes mellitus, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia during the neonatal period. 

### Function
The NEUROG3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of the endocrine pancreas. Specifically, NEUROG3 is essential for the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells, which are responsible for producing hormones such as insulin and glucagon that regulate blood sugar levels.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several reported mutations in the NEUROG3 gene that have been linked to neonatal diabetes mellitus. 

Some examples include:
- c.232C>T (p.Arg78Ter) - nonsense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs80356468)
- c.422G>T (p.Glu141Ter) - nonsense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs80356466)
- c.49C>T (p.Arg17Ter) - nonsense mutation (dbSNP ID: rs80356470)

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic variants reported in the NEUROG3 gene.

### Related Disease
NEUROG3 gene mutations have been linked to neonatal diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by hyperglycemia during the neonatal period.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for neonatal diabetes mellitus typically involves insulin therapy to regulate blood sugar levels. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. 

### Drug response
There is currently no known drug specifically targeting NEUROG3 gene mutations.
