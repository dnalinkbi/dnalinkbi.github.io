## Gene TLR4

- Function: The TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) gene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein that plays a crucial role in innate immunity. TLR4 protein is involved in the recognition of pathogens and activation of the immune response.

- External IDs: Gene ID: 7099; Genomic location: Chromosome 9: 99,786,561-99,795,033; Aliases: ARMD10, TLR-4, TOLL and RP105-like receptor 4.

- AA (Amino Acid) mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID: 
    - R526K (rs4986790): missense mutation, changes Arginine to Lysine amino acid residue.
    - D299G (rs4986791): missense mutation, changes Aspartic acid to Glycine amino acid residue.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - rs4986791: TLR4 D299G polymorphism has been reported to be associated with chronic periodontitis (PMID: 20974504) and asthma (PMID: 25493356). 
    - rs4986790: TLR4 R526K polymorphism has been associated with a reduced risk of bacterial meningitis (PMID: 14753398).

- Related disease: Mutations in the TLR4 gene have been associated with various diseases, including respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and atherosclerosis.

- Treatment and prognosis: The treatment for TLR4-associated diseases is based on the individual disease and severity of symptoms. Prognosis varies for each disease and depends upon many factors such as the extent of disease and response to treatment.

- Drug response: Targeting TLR4 with antagonists or inhibitors has been suggested to be a promising therapeutic approach for various diseases. Several TLR4 antagonists/inhibitors are currently in preclinical or clinical trials.
