# Gene CSH1

## Information about Gene
- Gene Name: CSH1
- Function: This gene encodes a member of the somatotropin/prolactin family of hormones that play an important role in growth control. The encoded protein is a growth hormone that is expressed in the placenta and is essential for proper fetal growth.

## External IDs and Genomic Location
- External IDs: HGNC:2445; NCBI Entrez Gene: 1441; Ensembl: ENSG00000204977; OMIM: 138760; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P0DML2
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q22-q24

Aliases: 
- Placental lactogen
- Chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1
- Growth hormone, chorionic somatomammotropin-like
- Lactogen placentary

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are various mutations reported in the CSH1 gene but most common are as follows:
- c.394C>T (p.Thr132Ile) `dbSNP ID: rs1800915`
- c.229C>G (p.Ile77Met) `dbSNP ID: rs1249672`

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic variants in the CSH1 gene.

## Related Disease
- Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
- Laron dwarfism

## Treatment and Prognosis
There are no known treatments for CSH1 gene-related diseases. However, in cases of IUGR, regular monitoring and nutritional interventions can help in improving fetal growth. The prognosis for CSH1-related disorders depends on the severity of the disease.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug that specifically targets the CSH1 gene.
