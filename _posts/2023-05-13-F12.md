## Gene: F12

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- F12 gene is located on chromosome 5 (5q35.3) and encodes for the coagulation factor XII, also known as Hageman factor.
- Coagulation factor XII is a serine protease involved in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade.
- Mutations in F12 gene can lead to inherited coagulation factor XII deficiency, which is associated with a mild bleeding disorder.
- Moreover, elevated levels of coagulation factor XII have been associated with thrombosis and stroke.
- Role of F12 gene in other diseases, such as angioedema and pre-eclampsia, has also been suggested.

### Function for gene:
- Coagulation factor XII, encoded by F12 gene, participates in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade by converting prekallikrein to kallikrein. It is also involved in the activation of factor XI, which in turn triggers the conversion of factor IX to factor IXa, ultimately leading to the formation of a fibrin clot.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
- Somatic mutations in F12 gene have been reported in various cancers, including bladder cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer. Some examples of somatic mutations in F12 gene are:
    - c.190C>T (rs141250545) in bladder cancer.
    - c.197T>A (rs752874547) in lung cancer.
    - c.218A>T (rs150232057) in kidney cancer.

### Related disease:
- Inherited coagulation factor XII deficiency
- Thrombosis and stroke
- Angioedema
- Pre-eclampsia

### Treatment and prognosis:
- Management of coagulation factor XII deficiency usually involves treatment with plasma-derived or recombinant factor XII.
- Anticoagulant therapy might be required in patients with elevated levels of coagulation factor XII to prevent thrombotic events.
- The prognosis of coagulation factor XII deficiency is generally good, with a mild bleeding tendency.

### Drug response:
- Some studies have reported that patients with elevated levels of coagulation factor XII might have a poor response to antiplatelet therapy.
