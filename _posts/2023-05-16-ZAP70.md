# Gene ZAP70

## Genetic Position and Pathology
The gene ZAP70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) is located on chromosome 2q12.3. Mutations in this gene are associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), autoimmune disorders, and cancer. 

## Function
ZAP70 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in the activation of T cells and natural killer cells. It mediates the T-cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction pathway by phosphorylating the transmembrane adaptor protein Lck, leading to downstream activation of transcription factors and cytokine production.

## Related Disease
- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Colorectal cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for SCID includes bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. Prognosis for SCID patients is generally poor without treatment. 

## Drug Response
Certain drugs may affect the activity of ZAP70 and its downstream signaling pathways, including immunosuppressants and targeted therapies for cancer.
