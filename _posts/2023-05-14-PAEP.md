## Gene Information
The gene of interest is PAEP.

## Genetic Position
PAEP gene is located on chromosome 9q33.2.

## Pathology
There is limited information about the pathology of PAEP gene, although some studies suggest its association with cervical cancer.

## Function
PAEP gene encodes for the protein progestagen-associated endometrial protein, which is a key factor in modulating immune response in the female reproductive tract.
