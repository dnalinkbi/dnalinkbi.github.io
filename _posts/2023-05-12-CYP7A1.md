# Gene: CYP7A1

## Information

### Genetic Position
CYP7A1 is located on chromosome 8 (8q12.1).

### Pathology
Mutations in CYP7A1 gene are associated with liver diseases such as intrahepatic cholestasis and gallstone disease.

### Function
CYP7A1 gene encodes the enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, which is responsible for the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Somatic mutations in CYP7A1 have not been reported in cancers.

### Related Diseases
Mutations in CYP7A1 are associated with the following diseases:
- Intrahepatic cholestasis
- Gallstone disease

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment for intrahepatic cholestasis and gallstone disease depends on the severity of the condition. In some cases, medication or surgery may be necessary. The prognosis for these diseases is generally good with proper treatment.

### Drug Response
CYP7A1 is involved in the metabolism of some drugs, including statins and fibrates. Polymorphisms in this gene may affect drug response.
