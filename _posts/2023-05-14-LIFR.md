## Gene: LIFR

### Information

- Pathology: Mutations in LIFR are associated with the autosomal dominant Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, which is characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties.
- Function: The LIFR gene encodes the receptor for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and mediates the signal transduction of this cytokine. LIFR plays important roles in immunity, hematopoiesis, reproduction, and nervous system development.

- Related diseases: Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, Acute myeloid leukemia, Breast cancer, and Lung cancer.

- Treatment and prognosis: Treatment for Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome is primarily symptomatic and supportive, focusing on management of respiratory distress and feeding difficulties. The prognosis for this condition is generally poor, with most affected individuals dying in infancy or childhood.

- Drug response: LIFR-targeted drugs are not currently clinically available. However, several drugs that target the downstream signaling pathways of LIFR, such as JAK inhibitors, are being evaluated as potential therapies for various cancers and autoimmune diseases.
