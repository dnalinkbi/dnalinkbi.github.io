# Gene ABO

## Gene Function 
The gene ABO encodes for the ABO blood group antigens present on the surface of red blood cells. These antigens are used to determine the blood type of an individual and are important for blood transfusion and organ transplantation.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no known somatic SNVs/InDels in the ABO gene.

## Related Disease
The ABO blood group system can influence disease susceptibility and prognosis for several conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and infections such as malaria and COVID-19.

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment and prognosis are dependent on the specific disease or condition involved and cannot be generalized for the ABO blood group system as a whole.

## Drug Response
The ABO blood group system may influence drug response for certain medications, such as antiplatelet agents used for cardiovascular disease.
