# Information about Gene HTR2A

### Genetic Position:
The gene HTR2A, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A, is located on chromosome 13q14-q21.

### Pathology and Function:
The HTR2A gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that binds serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological and behavioral processes. This receptor is known to play a role in regulating mood, cognition, and perception. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder.

### External IDs and Aliases:
- Gene ID: 3356
- Genomic Location: chr13: 42,315,626-42,488,712
- Aliases: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2, HTR2, serotoni receptor 2A.

|614|Missense|rs2296972|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
There are currently no somatic mutations identified in the HTR2A gene.

### Related Disease:
Several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder, have been associated with mutations in the HTR2A gene.

### Treatment and Prognosis:
There is currently no specific treatment for HTR2A mutations. Treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HTR2A mutations typically involves a combination of medication and therapy to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Drug Response:
Some drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants, target the serotonin receptor and may be beneficial for certain neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HTR2A mutations. However, drug response can vary depending on the specific mutation and individual patient factors.
