## Gene Information for HMGCL

**Function:** HMGCL (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase) is a crucial enzyme in ketone body metabolism. It catalyzes the final step of ketone body synthesis and promotes the cleavage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

No somatic SNVs/InDels reported for HMGCL.

**Related disease:**

HMGCL deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the body's ability to break down ketone bodies. It leads to episodes of hypoglycemia, vomiting, seizures, and eventual developmental delay and even coma.

**Treatment and prognosis:**

HMGCL deficiency is treated with dietary modification, including restriction of fasting time and increasing carbohydrate intake. It also includes maintaining hydration and preventing catabolism. However, the prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of mutations.

**Drug response:**

No specific drug response related to HMGCL deficiency has been reported.
