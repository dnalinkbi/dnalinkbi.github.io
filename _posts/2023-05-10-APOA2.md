# Information about gene APOA2

## Genetic Position
- APOA2 gene is located on chromosome 1 at position 1q21.3.

## Pathology
- APOA2 gene is associated with obesity and dyslipidemia.
- A common variant in APOA2 gene, rs5082, is strongly associated with food intake and obesity risk.

## Function
- APOA2 gene encodes for the apolipoprotein A-II protein.
- Apolipoprotein A-II is a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that play a role in lipid transport and metabolism.

## External IDs
- Gene ID: 336
- Genomic location: Chr1:155,971,807-156,021,129
- Aliases: ApoA-II, apolipoprotein A-II

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- p.Arg60Ter (rs148946257)
- p.Ala74Pro (rs11591147)
- p.His83Arg (rs72958711)
- p.Asp93Val (rs138326449)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Not available

## Related Disease
- Obesity
- Dyslipidemia
- Metabolic syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment for dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome includes lifestyle modifications and medications like statins and fibrates.
- Prognosis depends on various factors like age, comorbidities, and response to treatment.

## Drug Response
- Variation in APOA2 gene is associated with differential response to dietary interventions and obesity medications.
