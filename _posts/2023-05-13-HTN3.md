# Gene HTN3

### General Information

- **Function for Gene:** HTN3 encodes tropomyosin 3, which is a component of the actin filament in muscle cells.
- **External IDs for Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases:**
    - HGNC: 3612
    - NCBI Entrez: 7153
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000134057
    - OMIM: 606013
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9Y281
- **AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:** There are several AA mutations associated with HTN3 including: 
    - p.Thr180Met (rs61750602)
    - p.Arg167Cys (rs61750601)
    - p.Ala103Val (rs61750600)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are currently no somatic SNVs or InDels associated with HTN3 in dbSNP.
- **Related Disease:** Mutations in HTN3 have been linked to several diseases including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. 
- **Treatment and Prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for individuals with mutations in HTN3 vary depending on the specific cardiomyopathy diagnosed, severity of symptoms, and overall health of the individual. 
- **Drug Response:** There is currently no known drug response for mutations in HTN3.
