# Information about gene SCO1

## Genetic position
The gene SCO1 is located on the chromosome 17q21.31 within the genomic coordinates of 44,336,801-44,347,181.

## Pathology
SCO1 is associated with several diseases, including cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHCM), and Leigh syndrome.

## Function
SCO1 encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of COX, which is a key enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It plays a crucial role in the assembly of the copper center of COX subunit II, which is essential for its activity.
