# Gene: PBX1

## Information:
- **Pathology**: PBX1 gene codes for pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 protein which acts as a transcriptional regulator and plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Aberrant expression or mutation of this gene is associated with certain types of cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- **Function**: Transcriptional regulator involved in hematopoiesis, organogenesis and limb development.

## Related Diseases:
- Pre-B-cell leukemia
- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
- Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
- Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

## Treatment and Prognosis:
- Currently there is no specific treatment for PBX1 mutations. Treatment for related diseases such as leukemia typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplant, and/or targeted therapy.
- Prognosis varies depending on the type and stage of leukemia, as well as other factors such as age and overall health status.

## Drug Response:
- PBX1 gene may affect drug response in certain types of leukemia. Research is ongoing to determine the specific mechanisms and potential targets for drug development.
