# Information about Gene GABRB3

## Genetic Position
- GABRB3 gene is located at the chromosome 15q11-13 region (15q12).
- The genomic coordinates for this gene are 21,115,560 - 21,163,191 bp (GRCh38.p13).

## Pathology and Function 

- The GABRB3 (\#MIM: 137163) gene encodes for the subunit beta-3 of Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.
- GABA receptors are primarily responsible for inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.
- Researchers have found that GABRB3 gene is associated with Angelman Syndrome (AS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech and movement problems.
- It has also been implicated in other neurodevelopmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and epilepsy.

## External IDs, Aliases and Links
- HGNC ID: 4143
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 2562
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000141510
- OMIM ID: 137163
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: O14770
- Other aliases: ECA11, GABRB4, gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, beta 3, MGC126601

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- The GABRB3 gene mutation information can be found in dbSNP and ClinVar databases.
- A few examples of AA mutations are as follows:
    - L69P (rs137853672)
    - T302M (rs369522216)
    - N328I (rs200869015)

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- There is no information available on somatic SNVs or InDels for the GABRB3 gene.

## Related Diseases
- Angelman Syndrome (AS)
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Schizophrenia
- Epilepsy

## Treatment and Prognosis
- No cure or specific treatment is currently available for genetic conditions involving GABRB3 gene mutations.
- Treatment primarily focuses on managing symptoms and improving the overall quality of life of affected individuals.
- The prognosis varies based on the severity of symptoms and overall health of the patient.

## Drug Response
- There is limited information available on drug response related to GABRB3 mutations.
- However, some studies have suggested that drugs targeting GABA and GABRB3 may be helpful in treating epilepsy, ASD, and other related conditions.
