## Information about Gene FGFR4

### Genetic position:
The FGFR4 gene is located on chromosome 5q35.2.

### Pathology:
The FGFR4 gene encodes a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), which is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Aberrations in this gene have been linked to several types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and gastric cancer. Studies have shown that certain variants of FGFR4 may confer an increased risk of developing these types of cancer.

### Function:
The FGFR4 protein is a receptor for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which are signaling molecules involved in a variety of cellular processes. Binding of an FGF to FGFR4 on the cell surface triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration.

### Related Disease:
FGFR4 has been linked to a variety of cancers, including:
- Breast cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Gastric cancer
- Lung cancer

### Treatment and Prognosis:
Because of its involvement in cancer development and progression, FGFR4 is currently being explored as a potential therapeutic target. Several drugs that target FGFR4 are currently in clinical trials for various types of cancer.

### Drug Response:
Studies have shown that certain FGFR4 variants may predict a patient's response to chemotherapy. For example, in breast cancer patients, those with one variant of FGFR4 were more likely to respond to a certain type of chemotherapy than those with another variant.

### Instructions:
- Please provide more detailed information regarding the relationship between FGFR4 variants and cancer risk.
- Please include information on the specific drugs that target FGFR4 and their current status in clinical trials.
- Please provide references for all information presented.
