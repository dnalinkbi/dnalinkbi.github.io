# Information about gene LAMB1

## Genetic Position

LAMB1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position 7q31.3.

## Pathology

LAMB1 is involved in various pathological conditions such as cancer, muscular dystrophy, and congenital malformations. It plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by encoding a subunit of laminin, a glycoprotein present in the basement membrane.

## Function

The protein encoded by LAMB1 gene is an extracellular matrix protein that belongs to the laminin family. Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins that play a vital role in cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion. LAMB1 protein provides structural support to the ECM and promotes cell adhesion and migration.

## Related Disease

Mutations in LAMB1 gene are associated with various diseases, including muscular dystrophy, cancer, and congenital malformation. For example, a missense mutation (p.Ala1115Thr) in LAMB1 gene is associated with a form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A). Another study suggests that mutations in LAMB1 gene may contribute to the development and progression of lung cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for LAMB1 gene mutations. However, the treatment and prognosis depend on the associated disease and its severity.

## Drug Response

Currently, there is no information available on the drug response for LAMB1 gene mutations.
