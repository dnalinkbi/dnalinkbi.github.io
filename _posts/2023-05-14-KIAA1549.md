# Information about gene KIAA1549

## Genetic position

- KIAA1549 is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q34).
- It spans approximately 666 kilobases and contains 18 exons.

## Pathology

- KIAA1549 is associated with various types of brain tumors, particularly low-grade gliomas such as pilocytic astrocytomas and diffuse astrocytomas.
- Rearrangements involving KIAA1549 are common in these tumors, particularly fusion with the BRAF gene.
- The exact role of KIAA1549 in tumor development is not well understood.

## Function

- The function of KIAA1549 is not well characterized, although it is predicted to be involved in the regulation of gene expression.
