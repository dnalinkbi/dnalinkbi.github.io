# Gene KL

## Information

**Genetic Position:** Chromosome 13q12.1

**Pathology:** Mutations in gene KL have been associated with age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

## Function

The KL gene encodes for a protein called Klotho, which has been shown to regulate various physiological processes such as calcium homeostasis, insulin signaling, and life span.
