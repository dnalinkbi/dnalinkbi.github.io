## Gene BSCL2 Information

### Genetic Position
- BSCL2 gene is located on chromosome 11q13.

### Pathology
- Mutations in BSCL2 gene cause a rare autosomal recessive disease called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2).
- This disease is characterized by the absence or loss of adipose tissue, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and other metabolic abnormalities.

### Function
- The BSCL2 gene encodes seipin, a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid droplet formation and adipocyte differentiation.
