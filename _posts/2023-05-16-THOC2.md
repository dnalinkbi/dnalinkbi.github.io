# Information about Gene THOC2

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: The THOC2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. The specific genomic coordinates are 7q22.1.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the THOC2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including intellectual disability and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ARNSID). A missense mutation in THOC2 has also been associated with a rare genetic disorder called X-linked syndromic mental retardation, Hedera type.
- **Function**: The THOC2 protein is part of a protein complex called TREX (Transcription-Export complex) that plays a critical role in RNA processing. Specifically, THOC2 is involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
