## Gene: SSH1

### Genetic Position
The SSH1 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the q25.33 position.

### Pathology
Mutations or dysregulation of the SSH1 gene have been linked to multiple diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

### Function
SSH1 encodes a protein called slingshot homolog 1 (SSH1) which functions as a phosphatase. SSH1 is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and has been implicated in cell migration, cell proliferation, and cell adhesion.
