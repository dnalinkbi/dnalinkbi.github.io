## Gene OAS2
**Genetic position:** Chromosome 12: 113,875,428-113,888,952\
**Pathology:** OAS2 gene is associated with viral infections and cancers.\
**Function:** OAS2 encodes an enzyme called 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 2, which activates RNAse L to degrade viral RNA. Hence, it plays a crucial role in innate immunity against viral infections. It also has tumor-suppressing properties.\
**External IDs:**
- HGNC: 8102
- NCBI Entrez: 4939
- Ensembl: ENSG00000135446
- OMIM: 602887
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P29728

**Aliases:** 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 2, OAS1B, OAS-2, OIASO, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2A

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** Currently, there are no known SNVs/InDels in OAS2 gene associated with any somatic diseases.

**Related disease:** OAS2 gene is associated with diseases such as hepatitis C virus infection, flavivirus infection, and cancer.

**Treatment and prognosis:** As OAS2 gene is involved in innate immunity, there are no direct treatments available. However, modulation of OAS2 activity may help in controlling viral infections and/or tumor growth. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of the associated disease.

**Drug response:** There are no known drugs that directly act on OAS2 gene or its protein product. However, some drugs that modulate immune response may indirectly affect OAS2 activity.
