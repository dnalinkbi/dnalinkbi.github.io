# Gene: MT-CYB

## Genetic Position:
MT-CYB is a gene located on the mitochondrial genome. It is located on the heavy strand of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at position 14,603 to 15,777.

## Pathology and Function:
The MT-CYB gene encodes for the cytochrome b protein that is a part of the complex III in the electron transport chain of the mitochondrial membrane. This protein has a crucial role in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Mutations in this gene lead to mitochondrial diseases including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial myopathy, and mELAS syndrome.

## Related Disease:
Mutations in the MT-CYB gene have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including:
- Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy
- mitochondrial myopathy
- mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (mELAS) syndrome

## Treatment and Prognosis:
There is no specific treatment for MT-CYB gene mutations. Treatment mainly involves symptom management. The prognosis of patients with MT-CYB gene mutations varies depending on the type and severity of the disease.

## Drug Response:
There is limited information available on drug responses related to MT-CYB gene mutations.
