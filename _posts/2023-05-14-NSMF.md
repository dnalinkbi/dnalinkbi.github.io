## Gene NSMF

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
- Genetic Position: NSMF is located on chromosome 4 (4q25).
- Pathology: Limited information is available on the direct role of NSMF mutations in disease. However, overexpression of NSMF has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
- Function: NSMF is involved in protein-protein interactions and regulates the subcellular localization of target proteins. It has been shown to interact with the spliceosomal protein Prp19 and the transcription factor p53.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for NSMF in the literature.
- No dbSNP IDs are available for AA mutations in NSMF.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- Limited information is available on the involvement of NSMF in somatic mutations.
- No dbSNP IDs are available for somatic SNPs or InDels in NSMF.

### Related Disease
- Currently, no direct associations have been reported between NSMF mutations and disease development.
- However, overexpression of NSMF has been associated with HCC, which could indicate a potential role in cancer development.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- No specific treatments or prognoses have been defined for NSMF-related conditions as there is limited information on its direct role in disease.

### Drug Response
- No information is currently available on the response of NSMF-related conditions to specific drugs.
