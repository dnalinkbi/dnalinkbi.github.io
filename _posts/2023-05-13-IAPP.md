# Information on Gene IAPP
## Gene Position and Aliases
The IAPP gene is located on chromosome 12 at position 12p12.3. It is also known as Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Gene or Amylin Gene.

## Function of Gene
The IAPP gene encodes for a peptide hormone called Amylin or Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP). It is co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells and acts as a regulator of glucose homeostasis and digestion.

## Related Disease
Genetic mutations in the IAPP gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders. The accumulation of amyloid deposits in the pancreas due to amylin misfolding is also associated with type 2 diabetes.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for type 2 diabetes, but it can be managed through lifestyle changes and medications. Several drugs that target the amylin hormone are being developed to reduce amyloid deposition and improve glucose control.

## Drug Response
Amylin agonists such as pramlintide have been used to treat type 2 diabetes and improve glycemic control by slowing gastric emptying, reducing postprandial glucagon secretion, and promoting satiety.
