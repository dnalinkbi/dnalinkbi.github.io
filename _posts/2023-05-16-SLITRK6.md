# Gene: SLITRK6 

## Genetic Position
SLITRK6 (SLIT and NTRK-like family, member 6) is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q31.1).

## Pathology
SLITRK6 has been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Some studies have suggested a potential role of SLITRK6 in the regulation of neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and dopaminergic signaling.

## Function
SLITRK6 belongs to the SLITRK family of proteins, which are involved in the development and function of the nervous system. SLITRK6 has been shown to regulate neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, possibly by interacting with other membrane proteins.
