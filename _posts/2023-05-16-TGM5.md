# Gene Information: TGM5

## Basic Information

- **Function**: This gene encodes a member of transglutaminase enzymes that catalyze the crosslinking of proteins. This specific enzyme is predominantly expressed in the skin, where it plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope during keratinization.

- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 63039 
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 15q15.1
    - Aliases: DKFZp686I15196, TGM1L2, TGM3L, TGM5L, TGZ

    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: [Q9NZJ4](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NZJ4)

## Mutations

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
    - p.Trp241Cys (missense) with dbSNP ID: [rs5030865](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs5030865)
    - p.Arg287Gln (missense) with dbSNP ID: [rs5030866](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs5030866)

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
    - There are no reported somatic mutations for this gene.

## Related Disease

- **Disease**: Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis
- **Symptoms**: dry, scaly, or thickened skin, particularly on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet
- **Related mutations**: Mutations and polymorphisms in TGM5 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI) disease 

## Treatment and Prognosis

- The treatment of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis primarily involves management of the symptoms. Topical creams, ointments, and lotions, which contain emollients, urea, or lactic acid, can help moisturize the skin. Some patients with severe symptoms also benefit from systemic retinoid therapy.
- The long-term prognosis depends on the severity of the disease, and in some cases, it can significantly affect the quality of life.

## Drug Response

- TG inhibitors (such as new inhibitors based on a 4-oxo-2-phenylthiazole scaffold) can be a potential treatment for diseases associated with transglutaminases (TGs) overexpression, including certain skin diseases such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI).
- However, more research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of this treatment option.
