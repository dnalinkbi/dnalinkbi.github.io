# Gene SLC35G2

SLC35G2 is a gene that produces a protein responsible for transporting sugar molecules across cell membranes. It is located on chromosome 10 at position q24.1. This gene has an alias "ST3GalII" and external IDs such as HGNC:18417, NCBI Gene:163526, Ensembl:ENSG00000107554, OMIM:608683, and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:Q8IYV4.

### Function
The SLC35G2 protein is involved in the transport of sugar molecules from the cytoplasm to the Golgi apparatus, where they undergo modifications that are necessary for their function. Specifically, SLC35G2 transports a sugar molecule called sialic acid, which is important for regulating cell-cell interactions and cellular signaling.

### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several known somatic mutations in the SLC35G2 gene, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. One example is the missense mutation c.457G>A (p.Glu153Lys), with dbSNP ID rs3733310.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Other somatic mutations include SNVs (single nucleotide variations) and InDels (insertions or deletions) such as c.375-32_375-31insG (rs869320671) and c.433+21C>A (rs10193868).

### Related disease
SLC35G2 mutations have been associated with a rare genetic disorder known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIf (CDG IIf), which affects the formation of sugar molecules and can lead to developmental delays, intellectual disability, and other health problems.

### Treatment and prognosis
There is no known cure for CDG IIf, and treatment is supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications. However, early diagnosis and intervention can help improve outcomes for affected individuals.

### Drug response
There is currently no specific drug therapy available for CDG IIf. However, research is ongoing to identify potential treatments that target the underlying genetic and biochemical defects associated with this disorder.
