# Information about Gene KNSTRN

## Genetic Position
- Gene Name: KNSTRN
- Chromosome: 16
- Start Position: 63,124,613 bp
- End Position: 63,133,982 bp

## Pathology and Function for Gene
- KNSTRN is a gene that encodes for the kinetochore-localized astrin protein. 
- Astrin plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during the cell division cycle. 
- Disruptions in KNSTRN expression or function have been linked to various cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer.

- Colorectal cancer

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Treatment options for KNSTRN-related cancers may vary depending on disease stage and patient-specific factors. 
- Prognosis may also be impacted by these factors, as well as by the presence of specific mutations and/or comorbidities.

## Drug Response
- There is limited data available on drug response to KNSTRN-related cancers specifically; however, research in related areas suggests that chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel may be effective in targeting astrin-mediated processes.
