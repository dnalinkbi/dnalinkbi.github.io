# Information about Gene ITK

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** ITK
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 5: 128,953,585-129,198,877
- **Aliases:** EMT, LYK, TCRZ

## Function for Gene
ITK encodes for the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase, which is involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The TCR signaling pathway is important for the activation and differentiation of T-cells. ITK specifically plays a role in the differentiation and activation of CD4+ T-cells.

- **OMIM ID:** 186973
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID:** Q08881

## Mutation Information
### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations associated with ITK. Here are a few examples:

Mutation Type | AA Mutation | dbSNP ID
