# Information about gene PCDH19

## Genetic Position
The PCDH19 gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xq22.1. It spans about 3,047 base pairs and contains 7 exons.

## Pathology and Function
The PCDH19 gene encodes the protocadherin-19 protein, which is a member of the cadherin superfamily. The protein is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a critical role in brain development and function, particularly in the formation and stabilization of synapses.

Mutations in the PCDH19 gene are associated with epilepsy, specifically an X-linked epileptic disorder called epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females (EFMR). This disorder is characterized by early-onset seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems, and affects only females due to the X-linked inheritance pattern.

- HGNC: 29322
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 57526
- Ensembl: ENSG00000147133
- OMIM: 300088
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96NR8

Aliases:
- EIEE9 (Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 9)
- CDHR8 (cadherin-related family member 8)

## AA Mutation List and Type with dbSNP ID
- c.1178G>A (p.Arg393His) - rs80338734
- c.456C>T (p.Arg152Cys) - rs80338735
- c.1259C>T (p.Thr420Met) - rs751581962

All of these mutations are missense mutations, meaning that they result in a single amino acid change in the protein.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no reported somatic mutations in the PCDH19 gene.

## Related Disease
The PCDH19 gene is associated with epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females (EFMR).

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no cure for EFMR, and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms, particularly the seizures. Antiepileptic drugs may be used to control the seizures, and behavioral therapy and educational interventions may also be helpful.

## Drug Response
There is currently limited information on drug response in individuals with EFMR.
