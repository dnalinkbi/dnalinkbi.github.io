# Information about Gene SMC1A

## Genetic Position
SMC1A is located on Chromosome X at position Xp11.22.

## Pathology
Mutations in SMC1A have been associated with several disorders including Cornelia de Lange Syndrome type 2 (CdLS2), a neurodevelopmental disorder, and a severe form of the disease called CdLS4. Other disorders associated with SMC1A mutations include premature ovarian failure, hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome, and a form of X-linked intellectual disability.

## Function
SMC1A encodes a protein called structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A (SMC1A), which is involved in DNA repair, chromosome segregation during cell division, and regulation of gene expression. SMC1A is a component of the cohesin complex, which helps to hold sister chromatids together during DNA replication and cell division.

## Related Disease
- Cornelia de Lange Syndrome type 2 (CdLS2)

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no cure for CdLS, but treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and improving quality of life. This may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and surgery in some cases.

## Drug Response
No definitive drug treatments have been identified for CdLS or other disorders associated with SMC1A mutations.
