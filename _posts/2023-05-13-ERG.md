# Gene ERG

## Gene Information

- **Function for gene**: The ERG gene encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, which play important roles in many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The ERG protein is involved in regulating gene expression, particularly in blood vessel development and endothelial cell function.

- **External IDs for gene and genomic location, Aliases**:
    - Gene ID: 2078
    - Genomic Location: Chromosome 21q22.2
    - Other Aliases: ETS-related gene, EWS/FLI1-activated transcript 1, ETV-1, ERYthroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog

## Related Disease

- **Disease name**: Ewing sarcoma
- **Description**: ERG gene fusions with the EWS gene are present in approximately 85% of Ewing sarcomas. This fusion leads to an aberrant transcription factor that promotes the oncogenic phenotype of these tumors.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- **Treatment**: The standard of care for Ewing sarcoma includes chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Targeted therapies against ERG expression are currently under investigation.
- **Prognosis**: The prognosis of Ewing sarcoma depends on several factors including age, tumor size, location, stage, and response to treatment. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with localized disease is approximately 70-80%, while the survival rate for those with metastatic disease is approximately 20-30%.

## Drug Response

- **Drug**: YK-4-279
- **Response**: YK-4-279 is a small molecule inhibitor of EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG fusion proteins. It has been shown to inhibit Ewing sarcoma tumor growth in preclinical models.
