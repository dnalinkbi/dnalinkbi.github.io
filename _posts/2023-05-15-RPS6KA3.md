# Information about Gene RPS6KA3

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position**: RPS6KA3 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase A3) gene is located on chromosome Xp22.2.
- **Pathology**: Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene are associated with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS), which is an X-linked genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems and causes cognitive disability. 
- **Function**: The RPS6KA3 gene encodes a protein called Ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3, which is a serine/threonine protein kinase. This protein is involved in various cellular processes such as cell division, cell growth, DNA damage response, and control of gene expression. 

## Gene and Genomic Location, Aliases

- **Gene ID**: 9252

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

- Currently, there are no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the RPS6KA3 gene.

## Related Disease

- **Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS)**: This is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene. The characteristic features of this syndrome include cognitive disability, distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and delayed development.

## Treatment and Prognosis

- There is currently no cure for Coffin-Lowry Syndrome, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. 
- Early intervention, such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy can improve cognitive and behavioral outcomes.
- The prognosis of individuals with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome depends on the severity of symptoms and associated complications.

## Drug Response

- There are no specific drugs available for the treatment of Coffin-Lowry Syndrome, but medications such as anticonvulsants and psychotropics may be used to manage seizures and behavioral symptoms.
