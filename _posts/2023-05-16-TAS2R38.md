# Gene: TAS2R38

## Information
TAS2R38 is a gene that codes for a bitter taste receptor. It is located on chromosome 7 (7q35-q36). The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the perception of bitter taste.

## Function
The TAS2R38 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in taste receptor cells of the tongue. This protein is responsible for the detection of bitter-tasting compounds. Individuals with specific genotypes have been shown to be less sensitive to bitter tastes than others.

## External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC: 11772
- NCBI Entrez: 5729
- Ensembl: ENSG00000147862
- OMIM: 604569
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P59543

Aliases: T2R38, TRB7, T2R61, hTAS2R38

## AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
The following amino acid (AA) mutations have been reported for TAS2R38:

- V262A (rs713598)
- A49P (rs1726866)
- I118V (rs713603)

All of these mutations result in changes in the structure of the protein, which affects its function in detecting bitter-tasting compounds.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertion/deletions (InDels) reported for the TAS2R38 gene in the dbSNP database. However, none of these have been linked to any specific disease or phenotype.

## Related Disease
Polymorphisms in the TAS2R38 gene have been associated with variations in taste perception. Some studies have also suggested that TAS2R38 genotype is associated with food preferences and dietary habits. However, there is no direct link between TAS2R38 and any specific disease.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment or prognosis associated with variations in the TAS2R38 gene. As TAS2R38 influences taste perception, individuals with specific genotypes may have different food preferences and dietary habits.

## Drug Response
Certain drugs have a bitter taste that is detected by TAS2R38. Therefore, individual variations in TAS2R38 genotype may influence the taste and efficacy of these drugs.
