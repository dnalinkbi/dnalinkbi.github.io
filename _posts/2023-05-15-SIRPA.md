# Gene SIRPA

## Genomic Location and External IDs
- Chromosome: 20
- Gene ID: 140885
- Alias: BIT, CD172a, SHPS1, SIRP, SIRP alpha, SIRPA1
- HGNC ID: 16206
- NCBI Entrez ID: 140885
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000149948
- OMIM ID: 606066
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: Q9NSA0

## Function
SIRPA encodes for a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on the surface of various cells. It interacts with and inhibits the signaling of the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to the inhibition of cellular activities such as phagocytosis and cytokine production.

## Mutation
- AA Mutation: R82C
- Mutation Type: Missense
- dbSNP ID: rs3181077

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- dbSNP ID: rs33956830
- Disease: Melanoma
- Mutation Type: Missense
- AA Mutation: R77P

## Related Disease
SIRPA has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The role of SIRPA in disease pathology suggests that it may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions. However, further research is needed to fully understand its potential for treatment.

## Drug Response
Current research has shown that targeting SIRPA and its downstream signaling pathways may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer treatment.
