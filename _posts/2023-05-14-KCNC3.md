## Gene: KCNC3

- Function: The KCNC3 gene encodes a voltage-gated K+ channel that plays a key role in regulating the repolarization phase of action potentials in neurons and muscle cells.

- External IDs: 
    - Gene and genomic location:  Kv3.3, chr19:11,496,711-11,549,500
    - Aliases: KSHIIIA, Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv3.3

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - No somatic mutations were found in KCNC3.

- Related disease: Mutations in KCNC3 have been associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor coordination and can lead to progressive cerebellar ataxia, seizures, and cognitive impairment.

- Treatment and prognosis: There is currently no cure for SCA13, and treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Prognosis varies depending on the age of onset, severity of symptoms, and other factors.

- Drug response: There is limited information on drug response in SCA13. Some studies suggest that mexiletine, a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, may have some therapeutic benefits in patients with SCA13.
