# Gene SCA20

## Information on gene SCA20
- **Genetic position:** SCA20 gene is located on chromosome 11q13.5.
- **Pathology:** This gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 20 (SCA20) which is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that affects the cerebellum and results in gait abnormalities, dysarthria, and limb ataxia.
- **Function:** The exact function of SCA20 gene is not yet known, but it is predicted to play a role in regulating gene expression.

- **Aliases:** SCA20, MGC138231, FLJ10105.
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** No AA mutation list is available for SCA20 gene currently. 
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** No somatic SNVs/InDels are reported in SCA20 gene yet.
- **Related disease:** Spinocerebellar ataxia type 20 (SCA20) is the disease related to SCA20 gene.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** There is no cure or standard treatment for SCA20 disease. Treatment is supportive and symptomatic and includes management of gait and coordination problems, speech and swallowing difficulties, and other associated symptoms. Prognosis for SCA20 is variable and depends on the severity and progression of the disease in individual cases.
- **Drug response:** There are no specific drugs available for treatment of SCA20 disease yet.
