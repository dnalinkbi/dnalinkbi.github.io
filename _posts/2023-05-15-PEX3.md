# Information on Gene PEX3

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- **Genetic Position:** Chromosome 6 (6q23.3)
- **Pathology:** Mutations in the PEX3 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger spectrum disorder, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease. 
- **Function:** The PEX3 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the formation of peroxisomes, which are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are involved in various metabolic processes, including the breakdown of fatty acids, amino acids, and other compounds.
