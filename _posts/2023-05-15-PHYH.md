# Information about Gene PHYH

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function
The gene PHYH, also known as phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 23. The dysfunction of PHYH is associated with Refsum disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that impairs the breakdown of phytanic acid.  

Phytanic acid is a fatty acid found in high concentrations in dairy products and ruminant meats and is normally degraded by PHYH enzyme. The accumulation of phytanic acid damages the nerves, muscles, and body systems by forming lipid-laden granulomas. The symptoms of Refsum disease include peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, hearing loss, anosmia, and ichthyosis. 

## Function for Gene
PHYH encodes phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, which catalyzes the alpha-hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA to produce 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA, which is a substrate for further degradation of phytanic acid.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several mutations identified in PHYH that lead to Refsum disease. Some of them are:

| Amino Acid Change | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
|------------------|---------------|----------|
| V210L            | Missense mutation  | rs28936679 |
| R130C            | Missense mutation  | rs104894309 |
| L323F            | Missense mutation  | rs2686194   |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no known somatic mutations in PHYH.

## Related Disease
Refsum disease (OMIM #266500) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in PHYH that lead to the accumulation of phytanic acid in tissues and plasma, resulting in neurological, ophthalmological, and cutaneous symptoms.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of Refsum disease is multidisciplinary and includes dietary restrictions of phytanic acid, plasmapheresis, and supportive therapy of the symptoms. The prognosis for individuals with Refsum disease is highly variable.

## Drug Response
Currently, there are no drugs that directly target the dysfunction of PHYH. However, clinical trials are ongoing for the development of gene therapy and biomarker-based treatment approaches.
