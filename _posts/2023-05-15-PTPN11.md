### Gene: PTPN11

PTPN11 gene, also known as Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11, is located on chromosome 12q24.13. It encodes a protein called Protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), which is mainly expressed in tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. 

#### Function
PTPN11 protein is a member of the non-receptor type protein-tyrosine phosphatase family, which regulates various cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on different substrates. PTPN11 protein acts as a key mediator in several signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation during development.

#### AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID
There are several missense mutations reported in the PTPN11 gene, which affect the protein function and cause different disorders such as Noonan Syndrome, LEOPARD Syndrome, and Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome. Here are a few examples of AA mutations in the PTPN11 gene with their mutation type and dbSNP ID:

| AA mutation | Mutation type | dbSNP ID |
| -----------| -------------| ---------|
| E76K       | Missense     | rs587776819 |
| Y62C       | Missense     | rs587776825 |

| T73I       | Missense     | rs121908007 |

#### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations reported in the PTPN11 gene, which can cause various types of cancer including acute myeloid leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Here are a few examples of somatic SNVs/InDels in the PTPN11 gene with their dbSNP ID:

| Mutation                   | dbSNP ID    |
| ---------------------------| ---------- |
| c.1512A>G (p.E504G)        | rs121913414|
| c.444A>G (p.S148G)         | rs281864388|
| c.922A>G (p.N308D)         | rs121913640|

#### Related Disease
PTPN11 gene mutations have been associated with several genetic disorders such as:
- Noonan syndrome
- LEOPARD syndrome
- Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome
- Metachondromatosis
- Multiple Lentigines Syndrome
- Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia

#### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of PTPN11 gene mutations depends on the associated disorder. Some disorders may only require symptomatic management, while others may need more aggressive therapy such as surgery, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant. The prognosis of PTPN11 gene mutations varies depending on the associated disorder, severity of symptoms, and the age of diagnosis.

#### Drug Response
There are no specific drugs developed to target PTPN11 gene mutations. However, there are several medications used to manage the associated disorders such as growth hormone therapy, beta-blockers, and surgery.
