# Gene Information: PPM1D

## Genetic Position
- PPM1D is located on chromosome 17, band q23.2
- The genomic coordinates are 62,355,929 to 62,549,396 bp

## Pathology and Function
- PPM1D encodes for a protein phosphatase that negatively regulates the tumor suppressor p53
- It also plays a role in regulating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage response
- Mutations in PPM1D have been associated with different types of cancer and drug resistance

## External IDs
- HGNC: 9277
- NCBI Entrez: 8493
- Ensembl: ENSG00000117318
- OMIM: 605100
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: O15297

## Related Disease
- Breast cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Neuroblastoma
- Lung cancer
- Colorectal cancer
- Hematologic malignancies

## Treatment and Prognosis
- PPM1D inhibitors are currently being developed as potential cancer therapies
- Patients with PPM1D mutations may exhibit poor responses to chemotherapy and radiation therapy

## Drug Response
- Preclinical studies have shown that PPM1D inhibitors sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy
- Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PPM1D inhibitors in cancer patients
