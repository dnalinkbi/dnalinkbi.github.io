# Information about TNFRSF10B Gene

## Gene Overview

TNFRSF10B gene encodes a death domain-containing protein, which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This protein functions as a receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and induces apoptosis through the caspase 8 pathway. TNFRSF10B gene is located on chromosome 8p21.3, spanning from 26,117,136 to 26,126,710 bp. 

## Function for Gene
TNFRSF10B gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell death. It plays a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis, which is the process of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. TNFRSF10B is a receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and its binding to TRAIL leads to the activation of caspase 8 and subsequent induction of apoptosis.
