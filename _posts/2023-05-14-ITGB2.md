## Gene ITGB2

### Genomic Position, Pathology, and Function

- Chromosome: 21
- Location: q22.3
- Pathology: Variations in ITGB2 are associated with Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) which is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder.
- Function: ITGB2 encodes the integrin beta2 subunit, a cell-surface protein involved in firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. It plays a vital role in leukocyte trafficking and activation.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are no somatic SNVs or InDels reported in ITGB2.

### Related Disease
Variations in ITGB2 are associated with Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) which is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder. It is characterized by impaired leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection, delayed wound healing, and recurrent infections.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no cure for LAD1. Treatment includes aggressive use of antibiotics and regular injections of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate neutrophil production.

### Drug Response
Studies have reported increased susceptibility of LAD1 patients to severe bacterial infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis and aggressive antibiotic treatment have proven to be the most effective options.
