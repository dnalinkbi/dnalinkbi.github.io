# Information about Gene UNC119

## Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

- UNC119 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.32 in humans.
- UNC119 stands for "Uncoordinated gene 119".
- Pathology of the UNC119 gene is not well understood.
- The function of the UNC119 gene is associated with translocation and regulation of the translocation of PIP2, a lipid involved in a variety of cellular processes. UNC119 is also involved in the regulation of retinal photoreceptor synapse activity and integrin-mediated signaling.

## Gene Function

The UNC119 gene regulates the translocation of inositol phospholipids and is involved in the regulation of synaptic activity in retinal photoreceptors. UNC119 also plays a role in integrin-mediated signaling.

## External IDs, Genomic Location, and Aliases
