# Information about gene ACP1
## Genetic Position
The ACP1 gene is located on chromosome 2 at 2p25.1, from base pair 21,596,984 to 21,644,996.

## Pathology and Function
The ACP1 gene encodes an acid phosphatase enzyme, which is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters and plays an important role in signal transduction pathways. ACP1 has been associated with various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and some cancers. It has also been reported to affect insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.
