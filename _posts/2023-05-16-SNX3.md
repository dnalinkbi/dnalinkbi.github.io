# Information about Gene SNX3

## Gene Position
SNX3 is located on chromosome 6 at the position 6q21.

## Pathology
The current research does not indicate any disease caused solely by the mutation in SNX3.

## Function
SNX3 codes for a protein called sorting nexin 3, which is involved in the sorting of endosomal membranes. It also plays a role in antigen processing and presentation.
