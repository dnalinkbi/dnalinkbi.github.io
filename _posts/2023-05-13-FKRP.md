## Information for Gene FKRP

### Genetic Position
- FKRP gene is located on chromosome 19q13.32.

### Pathology
- Mutations in FKRP gene are associated with congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C (MDC1C), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I), and dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1X).
- Mutations in the FKRP gene lead to aberrant glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) and subsequent disruption of basement membrane integrity, resulting in muscle and heart dysfunction.

### Function for Gene
- FKRP gene encodes a protein called fukutin-related protein (FKRP).
- FKRP is required for the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, which is necessary for normal muscle and brain function.

### Related Disease
- MDC1C (OMIM#608307)
- LGMD2I (OMIM#253600)
- CMD1X (OMIM#611615)

### Treatment and Prognosis
- There is no cure for FKRP-related muscular dystrophy, but supportive care can help manage symptoms.
- Treatment may include physical therapy, respiratory support, and medication to manage heart or lung symptoms.
- Prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms and degree of muscle and heart dysfunction. 

### Drug Response
- Clinical trials are currently investigating the use of gene therapy and other treatments for FKRP-related muscular dystrophy.
