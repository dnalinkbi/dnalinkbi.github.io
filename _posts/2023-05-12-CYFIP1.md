# Gene Information

### Gene Name and Location

- Gene: **CYFIP1**
- Alias: **SRA1**
- Chromosome: 15
- Location: 15q11.2

### External IDs and Links

- HGNC: 17234
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 26999
- Ensembl: ENSG00000184012
- OMIM: 606254
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q96JG6

### Function of the Gene

The CYFIP1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization and dendritic spine maturation. It functions as a critical component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which is responsible for activating the actin nucleation factor Arp2/3 complex. CYFIP1 regulates synaptic plasticity and is required for normal cognitive function.

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID

- p.R87L (rs149824131): missense mutation that changes an arginine to a leucine amino acid at position 87.
- p.R179* (rs368143874): nonsense mutation that changes an arginine to a premature stop codon at position 179.
- p.P153R (rs367732934): missense mutation that changes a proline to an arginine amino acid at position 153.
- p.T379S (rs369459992): missense mutation that changes a threonine to a serine amino acid at position 379.
- p.V408M (rs373759099): missense mutation that changes a valine to a methionine amino acid at position 408.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID

There are no reported somatic variants for the CYFIP1 gene.

### Related Diseases

Mutations in the CYFIP1 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including:

- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
- Intellectual disability
- Schizophrenia
- Epilepsy
- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

### Treatment and Prognosis

Currently, there are no specific treatments available for CYFIP1-related disorders. However, early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes for individuals with developmental delay and intellectual disability. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of symptoms and other factors.

### Drug Response

There is no known drug that specifically targets the CYFIP1 protein. However, drugs that target the WAVE regulatory complex or actin polymerization may have potential therapeutic benefits.
