## Information on Gene HSD17B4

### Genetic Position, Pathology, and Function

Gene HSD17B4 is located on chromosome 5q23.1 and encodes for enzyme 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (17β-HSD4). The main function of this enzyme is the conversion of certain hormones and steroids to their active forms. In particular, 17β-HSD4 plays a critical role in the metabolism of bile acids and long-chain fatty acids. Mutations in the HSD17B4 gene have been found to be associated with the development of disorders such as peroxisomal disorders and D-bifunctional protein deficiency.
