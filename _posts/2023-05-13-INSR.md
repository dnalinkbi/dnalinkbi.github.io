## Gene: INSR

- **Function for gene**: The INSR gene encodes the insulin receptor protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating glucose homeostasis and metabolism.

- **External IDs**: 
    - Gene ID: 3643
    - Genomic location: Chromosome 19q13.2
    - Aliases: CD220, HHF5, HYK, INSRQ1

- **External sites**:
    - HGNC: 6091
    - NCBI Entrez: 3643
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000171105
    - OMIM: 147670
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P06213

- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID**:
    - c.2149G>A (p.Arg717His) with rs121908001
    - c.2086G>A (p.Arg696His) with rs121908002
    - c.2086G>T (p.Arg696Leu) with rs121908003
    - c.2024C>T (p.Thr675Ile) with rs121908004
    - c.1972C>T (p.Arg658Cys) with rs121908005

- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID**:
    - c.2240G>A (p.Gly747Arg) with rs797760524
    - c.2084G>A (p.Asp695Asn) with rs747410244

- **Related disease**: Mutations in INSR have been associated with various forms of insulin resistance, such as Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism), Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Treatment and prognosis**: The treatment of insulin resistance caused by INSR mutations mainly involves managing the symptoms through lifestyle changes, medications, and insulin therapy. The prognosis varies depending on the severity and specific type of insulin resistance syndrome.

- **Drug response**: Some INSR mutations have been found to confer resistance to certain insulin-sensitizing drugs, such as metformin.
