## Gene GAP43
- **Function:** The GAP43 gene encodes for a protein called growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which is involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, particularly in the sprouting and growth of axons.
- **External IDs and Genomic location:**
    - HGNC: 4136
    - NCBI Entrez: 2596
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000116044
    - OMIM: 162060
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P17677
- **Aliases:** B-50, F1, MGC129645
- **AA mutation list and mutation type with dbSNP ID:** There are several reported mutations in GAP43 gene, including missense mutations and frameshift deletions. Some of these mutations and their corresponding dbSNP IDs are:
    - p.Thr18Met (rs104894694)
    - p.Tyr20Cys (rs104894695)
    - p.Tyr20His (rs104894696)
    - p.Leu37Pro (rs104894697)
- **Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:** There are several somatic mutations reported in GAP43, including SNVs and InDels, and some of these are:
    - c.149delC (rs869312485)
    - c.476C>A (rs554731227)
    - c.97G>A (rs533074551)
- **Related disease:** Mutations in GAP43 are linked to several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and schizophrenia.
- **Treatment and prognosis:** The treatment and prognosis for GAP43-related disorders depend on the specific disease and mutation. Some treatments that are being studied include stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and various drugs that target the nervous system.
- **Drug response:** Several drugs that target the nervous system have been studied as potential treatments for GAP43-related disorders. These include cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics, and antidepressants.
