# Gene Information: CYP2A13

## Genetic Position
The CYP2A13 gene is located on chromosome 19 at the position 19q13.2.

## Pathology
The CYP2A13 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. It is primarily expressed in the respiratory tract and is responsible for metabolizing certain tobacco-specific carcinogens, such as NNK. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer.

## Function
The CYP2A13 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily. The protein is involved in the metabolism of various compounds, including drugs, toxins, and carcinogens. In particular, it is responsible for the metabolism of several tobacco-specific nitrosamines, including NNK and NNN.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the CYP2A13 gene have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, as the gene plays a key role in the metabolism of tobacco-specific carcinogens.

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment for mutations in the CYP2A13 gene. The prognosis for lung cancer patients with CYP2A13 mutations may vary depending on the severity of the mutation and the stage of the cancer.

## Drug Response
Genetic variations in the CYP2A13 gene can affect drug metabolism in individuals. For example, individuals with certain mutations may metabolize certain drugs more slowly, leading to potential side effects and toxicity.
