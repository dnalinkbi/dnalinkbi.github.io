## Gene Information: ADRA1A

- **Function**: The ADRA1A gene encodes for alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, mainly expressed in the smooth muscle of vasculature. It is involved in the regulation of vascular tone, peripheral resistance, and blood pressure.

- **External IDs and Genomic Location:** NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 148, Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000160710, Genomic position: Chromosome 8: 109,216,322-109,282,016 bp. Aliases: ADRA1C, ADRA1L1, ALPHA1AAR.

- **Related Disease:** Due to the function of ADRA1A gene in vasculature regulation, it is associated with various diseases including hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and anxiety disorders.

- **Treatment and prognosis:** The treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia includes the pharmacological inhibition of alpha-1A adrenergic receptor by selective antagonists like terazosin and alfuzosin. In anxiety disorders, the agonists of alpha-1A adrenergic receptor like phenylephrine are used. However, the prognosis of these diseases depends on multiple factors apart from ADRA1A gene expression.

- **Drug response:** The selective alpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonists like Terazosin and Doxazosin show better clinical response in hypertension patients having high ADRA1A gene expression.
