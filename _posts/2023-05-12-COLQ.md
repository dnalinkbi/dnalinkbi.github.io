## Gene: COLQ

### Function
COLQ gene encodes the collagenous tail of acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which is a glycoprotein mainly found at the neuromuscular junctions. The encoded protein is necessary for anchoring and regulating the synaptic enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and controls muscle contraction.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
- HGNC ID: HGNC:2195
- Entrez Gene ID: 1205
- Ensembl ID: ENSG00000143748
- Genomic Location: 3p25.2
- Aliases: CMS5, ENDplateCOL, ENSG00000269947

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid mutations detected in COLQ gene.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels detected in COLQ gene.

### Related Disease
Mutations in the COLQ gene are associated with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency and congenital myasthenic syndrome type 1U (CMS1U), a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue.

### Treatment and Prognosis
Although there is no cure for the CMS1U, symptomatic treatment is available which includes cholinesterase inhibitors and immunomodulatory therapy. Many patients with CMS1U can respond to treatment and lead a normal life.

### Drug Response
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in treating CMS1U. Pyridostigmine is the drug most commonly used in CMS1U treatment.
