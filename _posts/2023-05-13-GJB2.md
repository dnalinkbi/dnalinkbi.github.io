# Gene GJB2

## Information
- **Genetic Position**: Chromosome 13q12.11
- **Function**: GJB2 (gap junction protein beta 2) encodes a protein called connexin 26 which forms gap junctions. These gap junctions are channels that allow for direct communication between neighboring cells. In particular, connexin 26 is important in the inner ear where it is involved in the process of hearing. 
- **Pathology**: Mutations in GJB2 can lead to hearing loss, specifically a type of hearing loss called autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). 
- **Aliases**: Connexin 26, DFNB1, KID Syndrome, NSRD1, Vohwinkel Syndrome with Ichthyosis

## External IDs
- **HGNC**: 4287
- **NCBI Entrez**: 2706
- **Ensembl**: ENSG00000164689
- **OMIM**: 121011
- **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot**: P29033

## Mutations
- The most common mutation in GJB2 related to hearing loss is a single nucleotide change from cytosine to thymine at position 35 (35delG) in the coding region of the gene.
- Other mutations associated with hearing loss include: V37I, W24X, R143W, and 167delT.
- **dbSNP IDs**: rs80338939, rs104894382, rs104894383, rs111033240, rs549697011

## Somatic SNVs/InDels
- GJB2 is not commonly mutated in somatic cells as its mutations are typically related to hereditary hearing loss.
- However, rare somatic mutations have been reported in various cancer types. 
- **dbSNP IDs**: rs137854463

## Related Disease
- Hearing loss (autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss) 
- Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome 
- Vohwinkel syndrome with ichthyosis

## Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for genetic hearing loss.
- Treatment options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices to address the hearing loss and improve quality of life for affected individuals. 
- The prognosis for individuals with GJB2-associated hearing loss varies but generally depends on the severity and age of onset of the hearing loss. 

## Drug Response
- There is ongoing research into potential drug therapies for genetic hearing loss, including those related to GJB2 mutations. 
- However, as of now, there are no FDA-approved drug treatments for this condition.
