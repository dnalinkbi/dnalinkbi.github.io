# Gene CYP2R1

## Genetic Position
CYP2R1 is a gene located on chromosome 11q22.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in CYP2R1 have been associated with vitamin D-deficiency rickets.

## Function
CYP2R1 encodes an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of vitamin D3 into active vitamin D.

## Related Disease
- Vitamin D-deficiency rickets 

## Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment and prognosis of vitamin D-deficiency rickets is dependent on the severity of the disease. Treatment includes vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and in severe cases may require surgical intervention.

## Drug Response
CYP2R1 polymorphisms may affect response to vitamin D supplementation.
