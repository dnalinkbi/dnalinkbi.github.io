## Gene KLK2

### Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 19
- Location: 19q13.33

### Function
The KLK2 gene encodes for a protein called kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (KLK2), which belongs to the kallikrein-related peptidase family. It is predominantly expressed in the prostate gland and is involved in the proteolytic processing of proteins in the seminal plasma.

### External IDs and Aliases
- HGNC ID: 6374
- NCBI Entrez Gene ID: 3817
- Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000187634
- OMIM ID: 602936
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: P20151
- Aliases: FKLK, KLK-L2, PRSS6

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No amino acid mutations have been reported for KLK2.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels have been reported for KLK2.

### Related Disease
KLK2 has been implicated in prostate cancer, as it is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues. It may serve as a biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis and diagnosis.

### Treatment and Prognosis
As KLK2 is not directly causative of prostate cancer, there are no specific treatments aimed at targeting this gene. However, KLK2 expression levels can be used as a prognostic indicator in prostate cancer patients.

### Drug Response
No drug response information is available for KLK2.
