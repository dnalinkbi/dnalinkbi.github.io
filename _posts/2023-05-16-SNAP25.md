# Gene: SNAP25

## Gene Function
SNAP25 (Synaptosomal-associated protein 25) encodes a member of the SNAP family of proteins which are involved in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane in neurons. SNAP25 plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and has been associated with cognitive processes and neurological disorders.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic mutations identified in SNAP25, the following are examples:
- c.77G>A (p.R26H) rs1057523634 
- c.309C>T (p.L103F) rs104894495
- c.374G>A (p.E125K) rs769085565

## Related Disease
SNAP25 mutations have been associated with various neurological disorders, including:
- Epilepsy
- Schizophrenia
- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- Autism
- Parkinson's disease

## Treatment and Prognosis
There is currently no specific treatment for SNAP25-related disorders. Treatment options for neurological disorders caused by SNAP25 mutations are generally symptomatic and supportive, including cognitive and behavioral therapy, antipsychotic medications, and anti-seizure medications. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder and severity of symptoms.

## Drug Response
There is limited information on drug response related to SNAP25 mutations.
