# Gene Information Analysis Report: SLC36A2

## Gene Information
- **Gene Name:** SLC36A2 
- **Function for Gene:** The SLC36A2 gene encodes a protein called proton-coupled amino acid transporter 2 (PAT2), which is a member of a large family of transporter proteins. PAT2 is involved in the transport of small amino acids into cells. 
- **Aliases:** PAT2, ATB0+, SLC36A2, AAAP2, ATBOPLUS

## Genomic Location and External IDs
- **Genomic Location:** Chromosome 15
- **External IDs:** 
    - HGNC: 10922
    - NCBI Entrez: 54416
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000166743
    - OMIM: 610631
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9H2M2

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
- No common variants with amino acid mutations in SLC36A2 are reported in dbSNP.

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
- No somatic SNVs/InDels in SLC36A2 are reported in dbSNP.

## Related Disease
- No disease is directly associated with mutations in SLC36A2. However, studies have suggested that imbalances in amino acid transporters like PAT2 could lead to metabolic disorders.

## Treatment and Prognosis
- No specific treatment or prognosis is available for SLC36A2. However, addressing amino acid transport imbalances in metabolic disorders in general has been studied as a potential therapeutic option.

## Drug Response
- No specific drug response is known for SLC36A2. However, studies have suggested the potential of amino acid based therapies for diseases related to metabolic disorders.
