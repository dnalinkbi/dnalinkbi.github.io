# Information about Gene SPEN

## Gene Name and Genomic Location
- Gene Name: SPEN (Spen Family Transcriptional Repressor)
- Alias: MINT, SHARP, WRP, KIAA1578
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 1 (1p36.11)

## Function for Gene
The SPEN gene codes for a protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, development, and differentiation.

SPEN protein functions as a transcriptional repressor, regulating the expression of genes involved in several pathways, including Notch signaling, TGF-beta signaling, and Wnt signaling. It interacts with various other regulatory proteins to modulate gene expression.
