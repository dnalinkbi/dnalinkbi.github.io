## Gene Information

**Gene:** CDSN

**Function:** This gene encodes for a protein called corneodesmosin, which is found in the stratum corneum of the epidermis. Corneodesmosin plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the skin by anchoring the cells of the stratum corneum together.

**External IDs and Aliases:**
- HGNC: 1785
- NCBI Entrez Gene: 1049
- Ensembl: ENSG00000173545
- OMIM: 602593
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q15517

## Mutations

**AA Mutation List with Mutation Types and dbSNP ID:**

There are several reported mutations in CDSN that are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) and healthy hair. Here are some examples:

| AA Mutation | Mutation Type | dbSNP ID |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| L37F | Missense | rs121908003 |
| R45Q | Missense | rs80356411 |
| R103W | Missense | rs80356409 |
| R298H | Missense | rs80356414 |

**Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:**

There are currently no reported somatic mutations in CDSN.

## Related Diseases

Mutations in CDSN have been associated with the following conditions:
- Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI)
- Healthy hair

## Treatment, Prognosis, and Drug Response

At present, there is no known cure for ARCI. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and providing supportive care. Hair defects caused by CDSN mutations are generally asymptomatic and do not require any specific treatment.

There is not currently any known specific drug that targets CDSN.
