## Gene: IFT122

### Overview
- Function: The IFT122 gene encodes a protein involved in intraflagellar transport, which plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of cilia and flagella.
- External IDs: HGNC: IFT122, Entrez Gene: 55759, Ensembl: ENSG00000116190, OMIM: 610490, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9HBG6
- Genomic location: Chromosome 3p21.1

### Mutations and Variants
- AA mutation list: Several missense mutations have been identified in the IFT122 gene, including p.Asp351Gly, p.Tyr647Cys and p.Ser913Leu.
- Mutation type: Missense mutation
- dbSNP ID: rs201929297, rs150983709, rs138758562

### Related Diseases
- Cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) is a rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with IFT122 mutations. CED is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability and other systemic abnormalities.

### Treatment and Prognosis
- Currently, there is no cure for CED, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and supporting affected individuals. Prognosis depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of associated health problems, making it difficult to predict.

### Drug Response
- No information available on drug response.
