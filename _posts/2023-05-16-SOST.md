## Gene: SOST

### Gene Information

- Function: The SOST gene encodes sclerostin which is a negative regulator of bone formation through inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Inhibition of sclerostin is a potential therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis.

- External IDs: 
    - HGNC: 11185 
    - NCBI Entrez: 50964 
    - Ensembl: ENSG00000101336 
    - OMIM: 605740 
    - UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9BQB4 

- Genomic Location: Chromosome 17q21.31

- Aliases: CDD, DAND5, SOST1, VBCH

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

- Some somatic SNVs/InDels in the SOST gene include:
    - c.326C>T, c.435C>T, c.625C>T, 
- dbSNP ID: rs749696083, rs768294184, rs765347595

### Related Diseases

- SOST mutations have been associated with:
    - Van Buchem disease
    - Sclerosteosis
    - Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia

### Treatment and Prognosis

- Treatments for osteoporosis using sclerostin inhibition have been developed and are in clinical trials.
- The prognosis for diseases caused by mutations in SOST varies depending on the specific disease and severity of symptoms.

### Drug Response
- Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to sclerostin and increases bone formation, has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis.
