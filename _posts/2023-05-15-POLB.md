# Gene: POLB

## Genetic Position
- Chromosome: 8
- Location: 8p11.21
- Strand: plus strand

## Pathology
POLB gene is associated with several diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Function
POLB gene encodes DNA polymerase beta, which is involved in DNA repair, base excision repair, and DNA synthesis.

## Related Disease
POLB gene is associated with various types of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer.

## Treatment and Prognosis
The expression of POLB gene is used as a prognostic biomarker for various types of cancer. Inhibition of POLB gene expression or activity is being studied for the potential treatment of cancer.

## Drug Response
There are no drugs currently approved specifically for targeting POLB gene. However, some chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide and cisplatin, target DNA repair and replication pathways, which can affect the activity of POLB gene.
