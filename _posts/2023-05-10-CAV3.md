## Gene Information

### Gene Name: CAV3

### Function
CAV3 encodes a protein called caveolin-3, which plays a key role in the formation of caveolae, invaginations of the plasma membrane that are involved in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction.

### External IDs and Genomic Location
* HGNC: 1545
* NCBI Entrez: 859
* Ensembl: ENSG00000141510
* OMIM: 601253
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P56539

CAV3 is located on human chromosome 3 at position 3p25.3.

### Aliases
* CDPK1
* LQT9
* VIP21
* caveolin-3

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are several variants reported in the CAV3 gene with missense mutations causing amino acid substitutions. Some of the reported mutations with dbSNP ID are given below:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |

| p.Leu57Pro | Missense | rs137852687 |
| p.Phe97Leu | Missense | rs137852688 |

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are several somatic variants reported in the CAV3 gene with dbSNP IDs. Some of the reported somatic variants with dbSNP IDs are given below:

| Variation | dbSNP ID |
|-----------|----------|
| p.Arg64Cys | rs746973904 |
| p.Leu57Pro | rs746632803 |
| p.Leu53Ser | rs376686379 |
| p.Leu30Phe | rs1057519466 |

### Related Disease
Several studies have reported the association of CAV3 mutations with various diseases. Some of the reported diseases associated with CAV3 mutations are given below:
* Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C
* Rippling muscle disease
* Long QT syndrome type 9
* Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

### Treatment and Prognosis
There is no specific treatment available for diseases caused by CAV3 mutations. However, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. The prognosis of the diseases caused by CAV3 mutations depends on the symptoms and severity of the diseases.

### Drug Response
There are no drugs available that target CAV3 directly. However, drugs used for the treatment of related diseases like cardiac arrhythmia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be used for the treatment of diseases caused by CAV3 mutations.
