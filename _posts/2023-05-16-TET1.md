# Gene information

## Gene: TET1

### Function for Gene:
TET1 codes for an enzyme called ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1. It plays an essential role in the process of DNA demethylation, an integral process in organisms' epigenetic regulation. 

### External IDs and Genomic Location, Aliases:
- HGNC:11883 
- Ensembl:ENSG00000148356 
- NCBI Entrez:80312 
- OMIM: 610886 
- UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q8NFUZ 
- Genomic Location: Chromosome 10 (10q21.3)

### AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
There are various mutations associated with TET1 in different types of cancers. Some of the amino acid mutations with their mutation types and dbSNP IDs are as follows: 

|AA Mutation|Mutation Type|dbSNP ID|
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|K1320N|Substitution|rs767124551|
|N1547S|Substitution|rs139810989|
|L1500F|Substitution|rs542249684|

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
Some of the somatic SNVs/InDels with their dbSNP IDs observed in TET1 are:

|SNV/InDel|dbSNP ID| Cancer Type|
|---------|-------|------------|
|C1104T|rs199932026|Breast Cancer|
|C2386T|rs782364107|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|
|G1942A|rs147071209|Melanoma|

### Related Disease:
TET1 mutations are associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. 

### Treatment and Prognosis:
The treatment option for cancer involving TET1 mutation depends on the type and stage of cancer. The prognosis also varies depending on the type and stage of cancer. However, further research is needed to establish a clear association between TET1 mutations and prognosis or treatment response.

### Drug Response:
No specific drug has been identified for treating cancer with TET1 mutation.
