# Information about gene OSTM1

### Genetic Position
The OSTM1 gene is located on chromosome 3 at the position 3q22.1.

### Pathology
Mutations in the OSTM1 gene have been implicated in autosomal recessive osteopetrosis type 5 (OPTA5), a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density resulting from impaired bone resorption.

### Function for Gene
OSTM1 encodes a protein called osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1, which is involved in the regulation of osteoclast function, the cells responsible for bone resorption.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
There are currently no somatic SNVs/InDels reported for the OSTM1 gene.

### Related disease
- Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis type 5 (OPTA5)

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment for OPTA5 typically involves bone marrow transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disease and the age at which it is diagnosed.

### Drug response
There are currently no known drugs that specifically target OSTM1 for the treatment of OPTA5.
