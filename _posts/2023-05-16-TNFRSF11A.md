## Gene: TNFRSF11A

- Function: The TNFRSF11A gene encodes the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), which is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in the regulation of bone mass and immune function.

- External IDs and Aliases:

- AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID:
    - No known AA mutation for this gene in the dbSNP database.

- Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID:
    - No known somatic SNVs/InDels for this gene in the dbSNP database.

- Related Disease:
    - Mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene are associated with Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a rare disorder that disrupts the normal formation and breakdown of bone tissue.

- Treatment and Prognosis:
    - Treatment for PDB is primarily targeted towards the management of pain and prevention of complications, such as fractures and deformities. Bisphosphonate drugs that inhibit bone resorption have been effective in treating PDB.
    - The prognosis for PDB varies depending on the severity of the disease and the presence of complications.

- Drug Response:
    - Denosumab, a drug that targets RANKL, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases. It is also being investigated as a potential treatment for PDB.
