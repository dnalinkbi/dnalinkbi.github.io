# Gene: PAX9

## Genetic Position
PAX9 is located on chromosome 14q13.3.

## Pathology
Mutations in the PAX9 gene can lead to various dental defects, including hypodontia, oligodontia, and selective tooth agenesis. 

## Function
PAX9 encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in tooth development, specifically in the development of dental epithelium and mesenchymal cells. It also regulates the formation of odontoblasts, which are responsible for producing the dentin in teeth.

## AA Mutation List and Mutation Type with dbSNP ID
There are various mutations reported in the PAX9 gene associated with dental anomalies. Some of them are as follows:

| Mutation | Type | dbSNP ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p.Pro72Ser | Missense | rs104894398 |
| p.Ser138Phe | Missense | rs104894397 |
| p.Pro39Arg | Missense | rs114662997 |
| p.Pro52Thr | Missense | rs104894396 |
| p.Arg50* | Nonsense | rs199519738 |

## Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
No somatic mutations have been reported in the PAX9 gene.

## Related Disease
Mutations in the PAX9 gene are associated with various dental conditions, including hypodontia, oligodontia, selective tooth agenesis, and amelogenesis imperfecta. 

## Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for dental anomalies associated with PAX9 mutations is primarily focused on correcting the structural defects with the help of prostheses, implants, or other restorative measures. It is important to note that early intervention is crucial to prevent further complications. The prognosis is generally good, and patients can lead normal lives with proper dental management.

## Drug Response
There is no known drug therapy specific to PAX9 mutations.
