## Gene: RAF1

### Genetic position
The RAF1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3p25.2). It spans about 81.7 kb of genomic DNA and contains 17 exons.

### Pathology
Mutations in the RAF1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and cancer.

### Function
The RAF1 gene encodes a protein called RAF1 kinase, which is a member of the RAF family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The protein plays a key role in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which regulates multiple cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

### Somatic SNVs/InDels with dbSNP ID
Some of the somatic mutations in the RAF1 gene that have been reported in cancer include:

|Mutation|Mutation type|dbSNP ID|
|---|---|---|
|p.S259F|Missense|rs372452845|
|p.Q257P|Missense|rs372452846|
|p.G467V|Missense|rs796065676|

### Related disease
Mutations in RAF1 have been implicated in several conditions, including:

- Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome
- Noonan syndrome
- Cancer (e.g., lung cancer, colorectal cancer)

### Treatment and prognosis
Treatment and prognosis depend on the specific disease and the presence of RAF1 mutations. In some cases, targeted therapy may be effective against RAF1-mutant tumors.

### Drug response
There is evidence that RAF1 mutations can affect the response to certain targeted therapies in cancer.
