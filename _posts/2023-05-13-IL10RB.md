# Information about Gene IL10RB

## Genetic Position and Genomic Location

Gene: IL10RB (Interleukin 10 Receptor Subunit Beta)  
Chromosome: 21  
Location: 21q22.1

## Pathology and Function

**Function for Gene:** The IL10RB gene encodes the IL-10 receptor beta subunit which is a member of the type II cytokine receptor family. This receptor is essential for the IL-10-mediated signaling pathway. The IL-10 receptor is involved in the modulation of immune responses and anti-inflammatory activities.

**Aliases:** CIDX1, CDW210B, D21S58, CRF2-4, TNFR-2, Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta

- c.121G>A, dbSNP ID: rs784931218

## Related Disease

Variants in IL10RB gene have been associated with various diseases such as:
- Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
- Infections caused by intracellular bacteria and viruses
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Chronic spontaneous urticaria
- Primary Immunodeficiency Syndrome
- Increased Susceptibility To Asthma

## Treatment and Prognosis

As IL10RB is involved in the modulation of immune responses and anti-inflammatory activities, several therapeutic agents that target this protein have been developed for the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory disorders.

## Drug Response

- Ustekinumab (Stelara®), a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-12 and IL-23, has been approved by FDA for the treatment of adults with Crohn’s disease who have not responded well to other treatments.
- Canakinumab (Ilaris®), a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-1β, has been approved by FDA for the treatment of several autoinflammatory syndromes. 
- Belimumab (Benlysta®), a monoclonal antibody that targets B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), has been approved by FDA for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in adults.
